# audit/ - Audit Reports

Directory for storing automated audit reports and validation results.

## Purpose

This directory contains generated audit reports from repository-wide validation and quality checks. These reports help identify documentation issues, broken links, and quality problems across the codebase.

## Contents

- **FILEPATH_AUDIT_REPORT.md** - Comprehensive filepath and reference audit report
  - Link validation issues
  - Quality issues
  - File existence checks
  - Cross-reference validation

## Usage

Audit reports are typically generated by validation tools:

```bash
# Generate audit report
python3 -m infrastructure.validation.audit_orchestrator

# View latest report
cat docs/audit/FILEPATH_AUDIT_REPORT.md
```

## Report Structure

Audit reports typically include:
- Executive summary with issue counts
- Link validation issues (broken references, missing files)
- Quality issues (documentation gaps, formatting problems)
- Recommendations for fixes
