# audit/ - Audit Reports Documentation

## Overview

This directory stores automated audit reports generated by repository-wide validation tools. These reports identify documentation issues, broken links, and quality problems across the codebase.

## Purpose

The audit directory serves as a repository for:
- Filepath validation reports
- Link integrity checks
- Cross-reference validation
- Documentation quality assessments
- Repository-wide issue tracking

## File Types

### FILEPATH_AUDIT_REPORT.md

audit report containing:
- **Link Issues**: Broken references, missing files, invalid paths
- **Quality Issues**: Documentation gaps, formatting problems, missing content
- **Executive Summary**: Issue counts by category
- **Detailed Findings**: Line-by-line issue reports with file paths

## Report Generation

Audit reports are generated by:

```python
from infrastructure.validation.audit_orchestrator import AuditOrchestrator

orchestrator = AuditOrchestrator()
results = orchestrator.run_audit(repo_root=Path("."))
orchestrator.save_report(results, Path("docs/audit/"))
```

## Report Structure

### Executive Summary
- Total issues found
- Issues by category (links, quality)
- Scan duration and file count

### Link Issues Section
- Broken file references
- Missing target files
- Invalid path formats
- Cross-reference failures

### Quality Issues Section
- Documentation gaps
- Formatting problems
- Missing required sections
- Incomplete content

## Integration

Audit reports integrate with:
- **Validation Pipeline**: `scripts/04_validate_output.py`
- **Documentation Tools**: `infrastructure/validation/audit_orchestrator.py`
- **Quality Assurance**: Repository-wide quality checks

## Maintenance

- Reports are regenerated during validation stages
- Historical reports may be archived
- Reports help track documentation improvements over time
