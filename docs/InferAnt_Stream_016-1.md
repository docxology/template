## Agenda

### 1. Welcome & Introduction
- Brief overview of the livestream goals
- **Key Functions:**
  - `run.sh` options and interactive menu
  - Literature search and management
  - LLM-powered summarization of downloaded literature
  - Configurable, tested, validated manuscript generation
- **PROJECT FROM SCRATCH:** What should the topic be?
- **Meta-science themes:** Structure-Function, Games/Incentives, Systems View, 1st Person, (Post)Post-Modern Science

### 2. System Overview
- Introduction to the template repository
- Key motivations and design principles
- Two-layer architecture (infrastructure + project)

### 3. Repository Walkthrough
- Directory structure and core components
- Thin orchestrator pattern explained
- Configuration system (YAML & environment variables)
- Customization workflows

### 4. Live Demonstration
- Cloning and initial setup
- Running the complete pipeline (`scripts/run_all.py`)
- Manual orchestration: individual pipeline stages (00-05)

### 5. Developing with the Template
- Adding domain-specific scripts in `project/scripts/`
- Using business logic from `project/src/`
- Output and validation workflows
- **PROJECT FROM SCRATCH:** Live development session

### 6. Advanced Features

- Multi-format publishing workflow (PDF, HTML, slides, posters)
- Literature search and LLM integration
- Build verification and integrity checking

### 7. Interactive Q&A / Suggestions
- Answering live questions
- Discussing potential improvements
- Real-time template enhancement

### 8. Summary & Next Steps
- Key takeaways
- Resources and further engagement
- Community contributions
