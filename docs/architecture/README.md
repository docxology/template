**Quick Reference:** [Two-Layer Architecture](two-layer-architecture.md) | [Thin Orchestrator](thin-orchestrator-summary.md) | [Decision Tree](decision-tree.md)

## Purpose

The `architecture/` directory contains detailed documentation about the system architecture, design patterns, and implementation decisions.

## Contents

| File | Purpose | Audience |
|------|---------|----------|
| [`two-layer-architecture.md`](two-layer-architecture.md) | two-layer architecture guide | Developers, architects |
| [`thin-orchestrator-summary.md`](thin-orchestrator-summary.md) | Thin orchestrator pattern implementation | Developers |
| [`decision-tree.md`](decision-tree.md) | Decision tree for code placement | Developers |

## Quick Navigation

### Understanding the Architecture
1. Read [`../core/architecture.md`](../core/architecture.md) - System overview
2. Study [`two-layer-architecture.md`](two-layer-architecture.md) - architecture guide
3. Learn [`thin-orchestrator-summary.md`](thin-orchestrator-summary.md) - Pattern details

### Making Design Decisions
→ Use [`decision-tree.md`](decision-tree.md) - Code placement guide
