## Purpose

The `architecture/` directory contains detailed documentation about the system architecture, design patterns, and implementation decisions.

## Contents

| File | Purpose | Audience |
|------|---------|----------|
| [`TWO_LAYER_ARCHITECTURE.md`](TWO_LAYER_ARCHITECTURE.md) | Complete two-layer architecture guide | Developers, architects |
| [`THIN_ORCHESTRATOR_SUMMARY.md`](THIN_ORCHESTRATOR_SUMMARY.md) | Thin orchestrator pattern implementation | Developers |

## Quick Navigation

### Understanding the Architecture
1. Read [`../core/ARCHITECTURE.md`](../core/ARCHITECTURE.md) - System overview
2. Study [`TWO_LAYER_ARCHITECTURE.md`](TWO_LAYER_ARCHITECTURE.md) - Complete architecture guide
3. Learn [`THIN_ORCHESTRATOR_SUMMARY.md`](THIN_ORCHESTRATOR_SUMMARY.md) - Pattern details

### Making Design Decisions
→ Use [`DECISION_TREE.md`](DECISION_TREE.md) - Code placement guide
