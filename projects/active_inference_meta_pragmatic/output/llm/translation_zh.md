## English Abstract

This manuscript proposes a novel meta-methodological framework for understanding cognitive science and cognitive security implications, centered around Active Inference.  Traditional approaches often treat Active Inference as simply minimizing expected free energy, neglecting its fundamental role as a framework specification tool. This work demonstrates that Active Inference operates at a meta-level, simultaneously defining both epistemic and pragmatic frameworks, enabling researchers to design cognitive architectures and understand how different specification choices shape cognition, decision-making, and behavior. We introduce a (2 ×2) matrix structure – Data/Meta-Data and Cognitive/Meta-Cognitive – to organize this meta-level operation, revealing four distinct quadrants of cognitive processing.  Specifically, Quadrant 1 focuses on basic data processing and EFE minimization, Quadrant 2 integrates meta-data to enhance processing reliability, Quadrant 3 implements self-reflective control and adaptive learning, and Quadrant 4 performs framework-level optimization for sustained cognitive adaptation.  The manuscript provides detailed mathematical formulations and conceptual examples for each quadrant, illustrating how they interact and contribute to a unified understanding of cognition.  The validation approach utilizes a comprehensive set of benchmarks, including numerical stability tests, theoretical correctness assessments, and performance evaluations, demonstrating the robustness and efficacy of the framework.  The implications extend beyond cognitive science, offering insights into cognitive security by highlighting vulnerabilities arising from meta-cognitive manipulation and suggesting defense strategies.  Ultimately, this framework provides a systematic method for analyzing meta-level cognitive phenomena, their vulnerabilities, and their societal implications, offering a new lens for understanding intelligence and designing robust cognitive systems.

## Chinese (Simplified) Translation

本文提出了一种新的元方法论框架，用于理解认知科学和认知安全影响，核心是主动推理（Active Inference）。传统方法通常将主动推理仅仅视为最小化预期自由能，而忽略了其作为框架规范工具的基本作用。本文证明主动推理在元层面运作，同时定义了认知和元认知框架，使研究人员能够设计认知架构并理解不同规范选择如何塑造认知、决策和行为。我们引入了一个 (2 ×2) 矩阵结构——数据/元数据和认知/元认知，以组织这种元层面运作，揭示了四个不同的认知处理 quadrant。具体来说，Quadrant 1 侧重于基本数据处理和 EFE 最小化，Quadrant 2 通过整合元数据来增强处理可靠性，Quadrant 3 实施自我反思控制和自适应学习，Quadrant 4 执行框架级优化以实现持续认知适应。本文提供了每个 quadrant 的详细数学公式和概念示例，说明了它们如何相互作用并为认知理解做出贡献。验证方法采用了一套全面的基准测试，包括数值稳定性测试、理论正确性评估和性能评估，证明了该框架的稳健性和有效性。 影响超出了认知科学的范畴，为认知安全提供了见解，强调了元认知操纵带来的漏洞，并提出了防御策略。 最终，该框架为分析元层面认知现象、其漏洞及其社会影响提供了一种系统方法，为理解智能和设计稳健的认知系统提供了一个新的视角。
