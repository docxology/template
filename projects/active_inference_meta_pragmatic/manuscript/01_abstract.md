# Abstract {#sec:abstract}

Active Inference provides a unified mathematical formalism for understanding biological agents as systems that minimize variational free energy through perception and action. While traditionally viewed as a theory of how agents minimize surprise, we demonstrate that Active Inference operates at a fundamentally *meta-level*: it is both *meta-pragmatic* and *meta-epistemic*, allowing modelers to specify the very frameworks within which cognition occurs, rather than merely describing cognitive processes within fixed frameworks.

We introduce a \(2 \times 2\) matrix structure that organizes Active Inference's meta-level contributions across four quadrants defined by Data/Meta-Data and Cognitive/Meta-Cognitive processing axes. This organization reveals how Active Inference transcends traditional reinforcement learning by allowing modelers to specify both epistemic structures (what can be known, through matrices \(A\), \(B\), \(D\)) and pragmatic landscapes (what matters, through matrix \(C\)), creating a meta-methodology for cognitive science.

Our analysis shows that the Expected Free Energy (EFE) formulation operates at a meta-level where the modeler specifies the boundaries of both epistemic and pragmatic domains. Unlike traditional approaches where rewards and observation models are externally imposed, Active Inference allows researchers to explore how different specification choices shape cognition, decision-making, and behavior—making framework design itself a research question.

The implications extend to cognitive security, where understanding meta-level processing becomes crucial for defending against manipulation of belief formation and value structures. Our approach provides a systematic method for analyzing meta-level cognitive phenomena, their vulnerabilities, and their societal implications.
