# Abstract {#sec:abstract}

Active Inference is a theoretical framework that unifies perception, action, and learning within a single mathematical formalism. Traditionally understood as providing a principled account of how biological agents minimize surprise in their interactions with the world, this paper argues that Active Inference operates at a fundamentally meta-level. Specifically, we demonstrate that Active Inference is both *meta-pragmatic* and *meta-epistemic*, enabling modelers to specify particular pragmatic and epistemic frameworks for the entities they study.

Our analysis introduces a 2×2 matrix framework that structures Active Inference's theoretical contributions across four quadrants defined by the axes of Data/Meta-Data and Cognitive/Meta-Cognitive processing. This framework reveals how Active Inference transcends traditional reinforcement learning approaches by allowing modelers to define not just reward structures, but entire pragmatic landscapes within which agents operate.

We show that the Expected Free Energy (EFE) formulation, while appearing to combine epistemic and pragmatic terms, actually operates at a meta-level where the modeler specifies the boundaries of both domains. Through this lens, Active Inference becomes a methodology for cognitive science that enables researchers to explore how different epistemic and pragmatic frameworks shape cognition, decision-making, and behavior.

The implications extend to cognitive security, where understanding meta-level cognitive processing becomes crucial for defending against manipulation of belief formation and value structures. Our framework provides a systematic approach for analyzing these meta-level phenomena and their societal implications.
