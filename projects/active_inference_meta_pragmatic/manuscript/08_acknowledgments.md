# Acknowledgments {#sec:acknowledgments}

I would like to acknowledge the contributions and support that made this work possible.

## Intellectual Foundations

This work builds upon the foundational contributions of Karl Friston and the Active Inference research community. The Free Energy Principle and Active Inference framework provide the theoretical foundation for understanding cognition as free energy minimization.

## Community and Collaboration

I am grateful to the active inference research community for their ongoing work in developing and applying these ideas across diverse domains including neuroscience, psychiatry, artificial intelligence, and cognitive science.

## Technical Support

The implementation and validation of these concepts was made possible through open-source tools and frameworks that enable reproducible research and scientific computing.

## Personal Reflections

This work represents a personal exploration of the meta-level implications of Active Inference, inspired by the profound insights that emerge when viewing cognition through the lens of recursive self-modeling.
