# template_code_project TODO

This backlog is future-only. Completed validation and dated review evidence are preserved in
[`docs/maintenance/exemplar-backlog-history.md`](../../../docs/maintenance/exemplar-backlog-history.md)
or in source-owned generated receipts. Each active row must retain a stable ID, size, dependency,
next action, proving artifact, acceptance command, and negative control; absence of an owner or external receipt
keeps a capability blocked rather than silently promoting it.

## Backlog operating rules

- Keep deterministic and offline defaults unchanged unless an upcoming row explicitly scopes an opt-in.
- Do not close a row until its producer, artifact, consumer, gate, and failing negative control are present.
- Treat unavailable network, LLM, container, formal-tool, and publication paths as explicit skips
  or blockers.
- Re-derive counts and receipts from live source data; never copy measurements into this planning file.

## Integrity and template-status gaps

- Keep this exemplar as the smallest reliable control-positive path for code-centric research projects.
- Keep dashboard, API docs, figures, and manuscript variables generated from source, not hand-maintained output snapshots.
- Add a project-local output validation script only if it checks artifacts beyond the generic Stage 04 validators.
- Add or document a stable final artifact-manifest refresh path for single-stage analysis/render/copy checks. **Documented:** `infrastructure.core.pipeline.artifacts.snapshot_current_artifact_manifest` serves this role.

## Configurable-surface gaps

- Keep `manuscript/config.yaml.example` as the richer copy-and-customize template for publication, LLM, testing, and steganography toggles.
- Add any future optimizer hyperparameter config under typed source loaders rather than reading ad hoc YAML from scripts.

## Documentation and signposting gaps

- Keep README quick-start commands aligned with the qualified project name `templates/template_code_project`.
- Link new public artifacts from README, AGENTS, and `docs/_generated/exemplar_roster.md` through the generator.

## Test and validator gaps

- Add a negative control before widening optimizer claims beyond the bundled deterministic objectives.
- Add dashboard schema assertions whenever dashboard fields or chart payloads change.
- Close remaining infrastructure-path branch misses in `analysis/scientific_reports.py` and `analysis/workflow.py` with subprocess isolation tests mirroring `TestImportFallback` if coverage gates tighten further.

## Minor upcoming

| ID | Status | Size | Dependency | Next action / unblock condition | Proving artifact | Acceptance command | Negative control |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
No active rows are currently scoped at this size.

## Medium upcoming

| ID | Status | Size | Dependency | Next action / unblock condition | Proving artifact | Acceptance command | Negative control |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
No active rows are currently scoped at this size.

## Major upcoming

| ID | Status | Size | Dependency | Next action / unblock condition | Proving artifact | Acceptance command | Negative control |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
No active rows are currently scoped at this size.

## Backlog status

Rows remain active until the acceptance command and negative control pass in the same source revision.
A blocked major row is a deliberate boundary, not a skipped success.
