# Authoring Contract {#sec:authoring_contract}

## Obligations

| Obligation | Requirement |
|------------|-------------|
| Domain validator | Add domain-specific evidence before making domain claims beyond the exemplar. |
| Config ownership | Keep lexicon and slots in config.yaml, not in generated prose. |
| Regeneration contract | Regenerate outputs through the pipeline, not by hand-editing. |
| Risk review | Treat high-residual-risk integrity dimensions as fork obligations before publication claims are expanded. |

The authoring boundary tokens for this section are {{AUTHORING_BOUNDARY_TERM_1}} and {{AUTHORING_BOUNDARY_TERM_2}}. They mark the point where an author must either add new evidence and validators or lower the claim from certification to analogy.

## Fork checklist

1. Remap metallurgical stages to domain operations in `src/refinery.py`
2. Update lexicon categories in `manuscript/config.yaml` under `gold_refinement.lexicon`
3. Update `contribution_claims` with domain-specific evidence pointers
4. Add domain validators beyond the exemplar's generic gates
5. Replace or extend `src/integrity.py` dimensions when the fork introduces new failure modes
6. Regenerate all outputs through the pipeline:
   ```bash
   uv run python scripts/refinement_analysis.py
   uv run python scripts/z_generate_manuscript_variables.py
   ```
7. Do not hand-edit generated manuscript, PDFs, or figures

Do not hard-code equation, figure, or table numbers in prose. Use `[@eq:...]`, `[@fig:...]`, `[@tbl:...]`, and `[@sec:...]` so the renderer owns numbering and the tests can detect dangling references.

The authoring contract treats the risk matrix as a source checklist, not as a retrospective dashboard. If a fork cannot name who owns a high-severity integrity dimension, which validator detects it, and which evidence tier supports it, the fork should lower the claim boundary until that missing surface exists.
