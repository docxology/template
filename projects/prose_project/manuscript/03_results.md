# Results

This section presents the theoretical results and mathematical derivations obtained through our methodological approach.

## Theoretical Results

The main theoretical contribution is encapsulated in the following proposition:

**Proposition 1.** For any continuously differentiable function $f: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, the gradient descent algorithm with appropriate step sizes converges to a stationary point.

## Mathematical Derivations

Consider the Taylor expansion of $f$ around point $x$:

$$f(x + h) = f(x) + \nabla f(x)^T h + \frac{1}{2} h^T \nabla^2 f(x) h + O(\|h\|^3)$$

For small $h$, the dominant term is the linear term $\nabla f(x)^T h$.

### Advanced Convergence Analysis

The convergence rate for Newton's method is quadratic:

$$\|x_{k+1} - x^*\| \leq C \|x_k - x^*\|^2$$

where $C$ depends on the Lipschitz constant of the Hessian.

### Eigenvalue Analysis

For quadratic forms, the condition number is crucial:

$$\kappa(A) = \frac{\lambda_{\max}}{\lambda_{\min}}$$

The convergence factor becomes:

$$\rho = \frac{\kappa - 1}{\kappa + 1}$$

### Fourier Analysis

The Fourier transform of a function $f(t)$ is:

$$\hat{f}(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t) e^{-i\omega t} \, dt$$

Parseval's theorem states:

$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |f(t)|^2 \, dt = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |\hat{f}(\omega)|^2 \, d\omega$$

### Differential Equations

The solution to the first-order linear ODE:

$$\frac{dy}{dx} + P(x)y = Q(x)$$

is given by:

$$y = e^{-\int P(x) \, dx} \left( \int Q(x) e^{\int P(x) \, dx} \, dx + C \right)$$

### Vector Calculus Identities

The divergence theorem (Gauss's theorem):

$$\iiint_V (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}) \, dV = \iint_S \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{S}$$

Stokes' theorem:

$$\iint_S (\nabla \times \mathbf{F}) \cdot d\mathbf{S} = \oint_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r}$$

### Complex Analysis

Cauchy's integral theorem states that for analytic function $f$:

$$\oint_C f(z) \, dz = 0$$

The residue theorem:

$$\oint_C f(z) \, dz = 2\pi i \sum \text{Res}(f, a_k)$$

## Algorithm Convergence

The convergence rate analysis yields:

$$\lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} \|\nabla f(x_k)\| = 0$$

with convergence rate depending on the condition number of the Hessian matrix.

## Key Findings

Our theoretical analysis reveals several important findings:

1. **Convergence Properties**
   - Linear convergence for strongly convex functions
   - Sublinear convergence for general convex functions
   - No convergence guarantee for non-convex functions

2. **Optimal Step Sizes**
   - Constant step size: $\alpha = \frac{2}{\lambda_{\min} + \lambda_{\max}}$
   - Diminishing step size: $\alpha_k = \frac{\alpha}{k+1}$
   - Adaptive step size based on function properties

3. **Numerical Stability**
   - Condition number affects convergence speed
   - Ill-conditioned problems require preconditioning
   - Gradient computation accuracy impacts final precision

The visualization reveals several key insights:

1. **Function behavior**: Different mathematical functions exhibit distinct characteristics in their growth rates and oscillatory properties
2. **Convergence patterns**: Algorithmic convergence follows predictable mathematical patterns, often following $1/\sqrt{k}$ or exponential decay
3. **Statistical properties**: Real-world data often follows predictable distributions with well-defined statistical properties
4. **Growth relationships**: Various growth rates (logarithmic, polynomial, exponential) show clear mathematical relationships

Figure 3 illustrates the theoretical convergence analysis, comparing different convergence rates under various algorithmic assumptions.
