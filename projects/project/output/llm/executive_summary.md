## Executive Summary

This research presents a novel optimization framework designed to achieve both theoretical convergence guarantees and practical performance across diverse problems. The framework combines regularization, adaptive step sizes, and momentum techniques, building upon foundational work in convex optimization Boyd and Vandenberghe [2004], Nesterov [2018] and recent advances in adaptive optimization Kingma and Ba [2015], Duchi et al. [2011]. The core algorithm solves optimization problems of the form f(x) = n
i=1 wii(x) + R(x) using an iterative update rule with adaptive step sizes and momentum terms, as detailed in Section 3.  Experimental evaluation, as presented in Section 4, demonstrates empirical convergence constants C 1.2 and 0.85 matching theoretical predictions, alongside linear memory scaling and a 94.3% success rate across multiple benchmark datasets.  The framework’s scalability and efficiency, highlighted in Section 4, enable the solution of problems that would otherwise be computationally prohibitive.  The work’s significance lies in its ability to provide a robust and adaptable optimization solution, as demonstrated by the comparative results presented in Section 4. Future research directions, outlined in Section 5, include extending the theoretical guarantees to non-convex problems and developing stochastic variants for large-scale applications.  The framework’s impact extends to diverse fields, including machine learning, signal processing, and computational biology, offering a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners seeking efficient and reliable optimization solutions. The key contributions of this work are summarized in Section 2.
