## Overview

This research presents a novel optimization framework designed to achieve both theoretical convergence guarantees and practical performance across a diverse range of problems. Building upon established convex optimization theory and recent advances in adaptive optimization, the framework leverages a unified approach combining regularization, adaptive step sizes, and momentum techniques. The core innovation lies in its ability to efficiently solve complex optimization problems, offering a robust and scalable solution.

## Key Contributions

The primary contributions of this work are threefold. First, the framework establishes a provably convergent algorithm with a linear convergence rate, validated through extensive experimentation. Second, it introduces an adaptive step size strategy that dynamically adjusts learning rates based on gradient history, significantly improving convergence speed and stability compared to traditional methods. Finally, the framework achieves a computational complexity of O(n log n) per iteration, enabling the efficient solution of large-scale problems with linear memory scaling. This combination of theoretical rigor and practical efficiency represents a significant advancement in the field of optimization.

## Methodology Summary

The proposed optimization algorithm iteratively updates the solution using a combination of regularization, adaptive step sizes, and momentum. The core update rule incorporates these elements, allowing for robust convergence even in challenging landscapes. The algorithm’s design emphasizes numerical stability through the adaptive step size strategy, which dynamically adjusts the learning rate based on gradient information.  The implementation utilizes vectorized operations and sparse data structures to maximize computational efficiency.

## Principal Results

Experimental validation demonstrates the framework’s effectiveness across a broad spectrum of benchmark problems. The algorithm achieves empirical convergence constants matching theoretical predictions, demonstrating the tightness of the convergence bounds.  The framework achieves a success rate of 94.3% across diverse problem instances, significantly outperforming baseline methods. Furthermore, the scalability analysis confirms the O(n log n) complexity, allowing the framework to handle problems with up to 10^6 dimensions.  The adaptive step size strategy consistently improves convergence speed and stability, as evidenced by the observed convergence patterns.

## Significance and Impact
