Okay, here’s a detailed review of the manuscript, structured according to your requirements.

## Summary

The manuscript presents a novel optimization framework combining theoretical rigor with practical efficiency. The core algorithm, described as a combination of regularization, adaptive step sizes, and momentum techniques, aims to achieve both theoretical convergence guarantees and superior experimental performance. The manuscript’s key contributions include a unified approach, proven linear convergence with rate (0, 1), and an O(n log n) complexity per iteration. While the framework demonstrates promising results – including 94.3% success rate across diverse problem instances – the manuscript could benefit from further clarification regarding specific implementation details and a more rigorous validation of the theoretical guarantees.

## High Priority Improvements

The manuscript’s most critical issues relate to the clarity of the algorithm’s implementation and the robustness of the theoretical claims. Specifically, the description of the adaptive step size rule (Section 3.3) lacks sufficient detail. While it’s stated that the step size is dynamically adjusted based on gradient history, the precise formula or algorithm used for this adjustment isn’t explicitly provided. This makes it difficult to assess the algorithm’s stability and convergence properties. Furthermore, the theoretical convergence rate (Section 3.1) is presented without a full derivation, relying solely on the assumption of strong convexity and Lipschitz continuity. A more detailed proof or justification for this rate would significantly strengthen the manuscript’s credibility. Finally, the manuscript’s reliance on a single benchmark dataset (Section 4.2) limits the generalizability of the results. Expanding the experimental evaluation to include a wider range of datasets, including those with varying characteristics, would provide a more robust assessment of the algorithm’s performance.

## Medium Priority Improvements

The manuscript could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the memory requirements of the algorithm. While the complexity analysis indicates an O(n) memory requirement, this doesn’t fully capture the practical memory usage, especially for large-scale problems. A more precise analysis of the memory footprint, considering factors such as data storage and intermediate calculations, would enhance the algorithm’s scalability assessment. Additionally, the manuscript would gain from a more thorough exploration of the algorithm’s sensitivity to hyperparameter choices. While the adaptive step size rule is intended to mitigate this issue, a more systematic investigation of the impact of different parameter values on the algorithm’s performance would provide valuable insights for practitioners. Finally, the description of the experimental setup (Section 4.1) could be expanded to include more details about the hardware and software environment used for the experiments, ensuring reproducibility.

## Low Priority Improvements

The manuscript’s formatting could be improved by adding more descriptive section titles and subheadings, enhancing readability and navigation. The inclusion of a glossary of key terms would also be beneficial, particularly for readers unfamiliar with the underlying mathematical concepts. While the manuscript presents a comprehensive overview of the algorithm’s features, a brief discussion of potential future research directions would further strengthen its impact.

## Overall Recommendation

**Revise and Resubmit**

The manuscript presents a promising optimization framework with significant potential. However, the lack of detailed implementation specifics and a fully justified theoretical convergence rate necessitate revisions. Addressing the issues outlined above – particularly clarifying the adaptive step size rule and expanding the experimental validation – will substantially strengthen the manuscript’s credibility and impact.  A more rigorous derivation of the convergence guarantees and a broader range of benchmark tests are crucial before final acceptance.
