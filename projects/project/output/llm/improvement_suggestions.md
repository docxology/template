Okay, here’s a detailed review of the manuscript, structured according to your requirements, with a focus on actionable improvements and adherence to the specified format and token budget.

## Summary

The manuscript presents a promising optimization framework, combining theoretical rigor with practical efficiency. However, several areas require refinement to strengthen its clarity, impact, and overall suitability for publication. Primarily, the level of detail in the methodological sections needs expansion to fully justify the claims of convergence guarantees and complexity analysis. Furthermore, the experimental results, while demonstrating positive outcomes, could benefit from a more robust comparison against established state-of-the-art methods. Finally, the overall presentation lacks a clear narrative thread, making it challenging to fully appreciate the contributions of the work.

## High Priority Improvements

The manuscript’s core weakness lies in the insufficient elaboration of the theoretical foundations. Specifically, Section 3.1, “Mathematical Framework,” relies heavily on established results without providing a sufficiently detailed justification for the chosen approach. While referencing Boyd and Vandenberghe [2004] and Nesterov [2018] is appropriate, the manuscript needs to explicitly demonstrate *how* these results are leveraged to derive the specific update rule (3.3). The convergence rate (3.4) requires more rigorous explanation – the reader needs to understand *why* the adaptive step size strategy guarantees linear convergence.  Furthermore, the discussion of the Lipschitz continuity assumption (9.2.1) is too brief; it should include a more detailed explanation of its significance and potential limitations. (WHAT: Lack of detailed justification for theoretical claims; WHY: Reduces confidence in the methodology; HOW: Expand Section 3.1 with a step-by-step derivation of the update rule and a more thorough discussion of the convergence rate and Lipschitz continuity assumptions.)

Secondly, the experimental results (Section 4) lack sufficient comparative analysis. While the reported performance is encouraging, the manuscript should include a more detailed comparison against established optimization algorithms, such as L-BFGS and Adam, across a wider range of benchmark problems.  Simply stating “superior performance” is insufficient; the manuscript needs to quantify the performance gains relative to these baselines. (WHAT: Insufficient comparative analysis; WHY: Weakens the impact of the results; HOW: Include a more comprehensive performance table comparing the proposed method with state-of-the-art algorithms across multiple datasets, quantifying the performance improvements.)

Finally, the organization of the manuscript feels somewhat disjointed. The detailed descriptions of the algorithm in Section 3 are followed by a relatively sparse presentation of the experimental results in Section 4.  A clearer structure, perhaps with a dedicated section summarizing the key experimental findings and their implications, would improve readability. (WHAT: Disjointed organization; WHY: Reduces clarity and flow; HOW: Reorganize the manuscript to create a more cohesive narrative, potentially adding a dedicated section summarizing the key experimental findings.)

## Medium Priority Improvements

The manuscript could benefit from a more precise definition of the “adaptive step size” strategy (3.5). While the description mentions adjusting the learning rate based on gradient history, it lacks specific details on the calculation method. Providing a more explicit formula or a diagram would enhance understanding. (WHAT: Vague description of adaptive step size; WHY: Reduces clarity and potential for replication; HOW: Provide a more detailed formula or a visual representation of the adaptive step size calculation.)

The documentation of the implementation details (Section 3.3) could be improved. While it mentions vectorization and parallelization, it would be beneficial to provide specific details on the hardware and software configurations used during the experiments. (WHAT: Lack of specific implementation details; WHY: Reduces reproducibility; HOW: Include a section detailing the hardware and software environment used for the experiments.)

The section on “Data Availability” (2.6) is currently too brief. It should include more specific information about the data preprocessing steps applied, such as normalization techniques and outlier removal methods. (WHAT: Insufficient detail on data preprocessing; WHY: Reduces reproducibility; HOW: Expand the section to include a detailed description of the data preprocessing steps.)

## Low Priority Improvements

The figure descriptions in the appendix (Sections 8.1 and 8.2) could be more detailed. While they provide a basic explanation of the figures, they could benefit from more context and interpretation. (WHAT: Brief figure descriptions; WHY: Reduces understanding; HOW: Expand the descriptions to provide more context and interpretation.)

The glossary (Section 13) is currently quite sparse. Expanding it with more key terms and definitions would improve the accessibility of the manuscript. (WHAT: Limited glossary; WHY: Reduces accessibility; HOW: Add more key terms and definitions to the glossary.)

## Overall Recommendation

**Accept with Major Revisions**. The manuscript presents a potentially valuable optimization framework, but significant revisions are required to address the issues outlined above. Specifically, a more detailed theoretical justification, a more robust comparative analysis, and a more cohesive presentation are essential to strengthen the manuscript's impact and credibility. Addressing these revisions will substantially improve the clarity, rigor, and overall quality of the work.
