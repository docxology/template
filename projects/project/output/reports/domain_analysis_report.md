# Economics Domain Analysis

## Overview
This analysis examines the Economics domain within Ento-Linguistic research, focusing on how terminology structures understanding of this conceptual area.

## Key Terminology
trade-off, cost-effective

## Term Patterns
- compound: 2

## Framing Assumptions
- Colony economics mirror human market systems
- Resource allocation follows market principles
- Costs and benefits analogous to human economics
- Optimization implies conscious decision-making

## Ambiguities Identified
- **trade**: Biological exchange vs economic metaphor (contexts: resource exchange, trophallaxis, metaphorical usage)
- **cost**: Multiple types of costs conflated (contexts: energetic expenditure, risk, opportunity cost)

## Recommendations
- Specify type of resource allocation mechanism
- Use 'resource exchange' rather than 'trade'
- Specify cost type (energetic, risk, opportunity)
- Avoid assuming conscious economic decision-making

# Unit Of Individuality Domain Analysis

## Overview
This analysis examines the Unit Of Individuality domain within Ento-Linguistic research, focusing on how terminology structures understanding of this conceptual area.

## Key Terminology
colony

## Term Patterns


## Framing Assumptions
- Individuality exists on a single biological scale
- Colony-level traits are emergent rather than individual
- Superorganism concept implies loss of individual agency
- Nestmate recognition defines individual boundaries

## Ambiguities Identified
- **colony**: Shifts meaning across biological scales (contexts: reproductive unit, behavioral entity, ecological unit)
- **individual**: Multiple biological scales of individuality (contexts: nestmate, colony member, genetic individual)

## Recommendations
- Specify biological scale when using individuality terms
- Distinguish between genetic, physiological, and social individuality
- Use 'colony-level' vs 'individual-level' traits explicitly for individuality
- Avoid assuming single scale of biological organization

# Behavior And Identity Domain Analysis

## Overview
This analysis examines the Behavior And Identity domain within Ento-Linguistic research, focusing on how terminology structures understanding of this conceptual area.

## Key Terminology
behavior, behavioral, foraging

## Term Patterns


## Framing Assumptions
- Behavioral categories reflect discrete identities
- Task performance defines individual identity
- Behavioral specialization is fixed and heritable
- Foraging behavior indicates specialized role

## Ambiguities Identified
- **forager**: Identity vs behavior vs observation (contexts: observed carrying food, genetically predisposed, temporarily assigned)
- **worker**: Reproductive status vs behavioral role (contexts: sterile female, non-reproductive adult, task-performing individual)

## Recommendations
- Distinguish between behavioral observations and identities
- Specify whether behavioral roles are fixed or plastic
- Use 'behavioral specialization' rather than 'caste identity'
- Avoid assuming heritability of behavioral roles

# Kin And Relatedness Domain Analysis

## Overview
This analysis examines the Kin And Relatedness domain within Ento-Linguistic research, focusing on how terminology structures understanding of this conceptual area.

## Key Terminology
decision-making

## Term Patterns
- compound: 1

## Framing Assumptions
- Kinship follows human family structures
- Relatedness is primarily genetic
- Kin recognition requires genetic similarity
- Family relationships mirror human patterns

## Ambiguities Identified
- **kin**: Genetic vs social kinship (contexts: genetic relatives, social affiliates, colony members)
- **family**: Human family structures vs insect groupings (contexts: nuclear family, colony kin group, mating pair)

## Recommendations
- Specify type of relatedness (genetic, social, environmental)
- Use 'relatedness coefficient' for genetic measures
- Avoid 'family' for insect groupings
- Specify mechanisms of kin recognition

# Sex And Reproduction Domain Analysis

## Overview
This analysis examines the Sex And Reproduction domain within Ento-Linguistic research, focusing on how terminology structures understanding of this conceptual area.

## Key Terminology
reproduction

## Term Patterns


## Framing Assumptions
- Sex determination follows binary human model
- Reproductive roles determine social status
- Mating systems analogous to human relationships
- Parental investment follows human patterns

## Ambiguities Identified
- **sex determination**: Multiple mechanisms conflated (contexts: chromosomal, environmental, social)
- **female**: Reproductive capacity vs morphological sex (contexts: reproductive queen, sterile worker, developmental stage)

## Recommendations
- Specify mechanism of sex determination
- Use 'reproductive female' vs 'morphological female'
- Avoid assuming binary sex determination
- Specify reproductive strategy explicitly
