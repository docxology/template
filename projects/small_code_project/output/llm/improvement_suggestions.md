## Summary

This manuscript presents a minimal computational research project demonstrating gradient descent for quadratic minimization. While the project successfully implements the algorithm and generates a research pipeline, several areas require refinement to enhance clarity, rigor, and reproducibility. Specifically, the ‘Methodology’ section lacks sufficient detail regarding the test problem setup and the rationale behind the chosen step size analysis. The ‘Results’ section could benefit from more explicit discussion of convergence criteria and a more robust presentation of performance metrics. Finally, the ‘Discussion’ section needs to expand on the limitations of the approach and suggest potential future extensions with greater specificity. Addressing these points will significantly strengthen the manuscript’s overall quality and impact. (Referring to 1.1.2, 2.1.2, 3.1, 3.4.2)

## High Priority Improvements

The most critical improvements concern the clarity and detail within the ‘Methodology’ and ‘Results’ sections. Firstly, the description of the test problem (2.1.2) requires substantial expansion. While it states the problem is a quadratic function, it doesn’t fully articulate the specific function *f(x) = 1/2 * x² - x*.  This omission hinders understanding and replication. *WHY* this is important is that the analytical solution (x=1) is crucial for validating the algorithm’s convergence. *HOW* to address this is to explicitly state the function and its gradient, providing a complete definition for the reader. Secondly, the step size analysis (2.2.1) needs more justification. The manuscript mentions testing step sizes of 0.01, 0.05, 0.10, and 0.20, but doesn’t explain *why* these particular values were chosen. *WHY* this is important is that the choice of step size dramatically impacts convergence. *HOW* to address this is to include a brief discussion of the trade-offs between step size and convergence speed, perhaps referencing a convergence rate equation.  Finally, the ‘Results’ section (3.1, 3.3) needs a more thorough discussion of the convergence criteria. The manuscript states that the algorithm terminates when the gradient norm falls below tolerance, but doesn’t define ‘tolerance’ or explain *why* a specific value was chosen. *WHY* this is important is that the convergence criteria directly influence the algorithm’s accuracy and stability. *HOW* to address this is to provide the value of ‘tolerance’ and its relation to the desired accuracy. (Referring to 2.2.2, 3.1, 3.3.1)

## Medium Priority Improvements

The ‘Results’ section’s presentation of performance metrics could be improved. While the table of results (3.2) shows the final solution and iteration counts for different step sizes, it lacks context. *WHY* this is important is that simply reporting the final solution doesn’t fully capture the algorithm’s performance. *HOW* to address this is to include additional metrics, such as the number of iterations required to reach the solution, and the relative error between the solution and the analytical optimum.  Furthermore, the discussion of convergence speed (3.3.1) could benefit from a more quantitative analysis. *WHY* this is important is that understanding the convergence rate provides valuable insights into the algorithm’s efficiency. *HOW* to address this is to include a graph of the convergence trajectory, visualizing the algorithm’s progress over time.  The ‘Discussion’ section (3.7) needs to expand on the limitations of the approach. *WHY* this is important is that acknowledging the limitations enhances the credibility of the research. *HOW* to address this is to discuss potential issues, such as the sensitivity of the algorithm to step size, and its applicability to more complex optimization problems. (Referring to 3.2, 3.3.1, 3.4.2)

## Low Priority Improvements

The ‘Implementation Details’ section (2.3) is adequate but could benefit from a brief mention of numerical stability considerations. *WHY* this is important is that numerical stability is a fundamental aspect of optimization algorithms. *HOW* to address this is to briefly state that the implementation uses NumPy for vectorized computations, which helps to mitigate numerical errors. The overall formatting of the manuscript is generally acceptable, but some sections could benefit from clearer headings and subheadings. (Referring to 2.3.1)

## Overall Recommendation

Accept with Major Revisions. The manuscript demonstrates a basic understanding of gradient descent and provides a functional implementation. However, significant improvements are needed to enhance clarity, rigor, and reproducibility. Addressing the high-priority issues regarding the test problem definition, convergence criteria, and performance metrics is essential before the manuscript can be considered for publication. The inclusion of a more detailed discussion of limitations and future extensions would further strengthen the work. (85 words)
