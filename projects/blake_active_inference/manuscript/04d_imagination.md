### The Generative Model as Self

Blake's claim is radical and recursive: not merely that imagination constitutes human existence, but that the relationship between agent and model is one of mutual entailment---"exists in us & we in him." The generative model does not belong to an agent; the generative model *is* the agent. Active Inference formalizes this:

> "Consciousness is nothing more than inference about my future; namely, the self-evidencing consequences of what I could do."

The self as process, not entity:

> "The self is the result of an ongoing predictive process within a generative model that is centered onto the organism."
>

And the body as probabilistically "most likely to be me":

> "One's own body is the one which has the highest probability of being 'me' as other objects are probabilistically less likely to evoke the same sensory inputs."

**Agent identity:**

\begin{equation}\label{eq:agent_identity}
\text{Self} \equiv p(o, \theta)
\end{equation}

The generative model defines:

- What counts as inside/outside (blanket structure)
- What states are expected (prior beliefs)
- What observations mean (likelihood mapping)
- What actions are available (policy repertoire)

Without model, no agent. The self *is* the generative model (Equation \ref{eq:agent_identity}), bounded by its Markov blanket (Equation \ref{eq:conditional_independence}). Seth's "cybernetic Bayesian brain" makes this explicit: selfhood arises from the brain's predictive model of its own body, a "controlled hallucination" grounded in interoceptive and proprioceptive inference [@seth2014cybernetic]. Blake saw this two centuries earlier: "As a man is, so he sees." The internal structure determines external appearance.

Blake's embodied vision:

And the constitutive claim:

The generative model shapes what can be perceived. The "formed Eye" is the structure of inference itself.

### Man Is All Imagination: Autopoiesis and Self-Modeling

The recursive structure of Blake's epigraph above—"exists in us & we in him"—is autopoiesis: the agent IS its generative model. "God in us" = our model of world. "We in him" = we are part of what the model represents. The nested embedding describes Markov blankets within Markov blankets—the recursive self-modeling that constitutes agency.

There is no man "underneath" imagination; imagination is what man *is*. The generative model doesn't belong to an agent—the generative model IS the agent.

### Mental Things Alone Real

Blake extends this to a full phenomenological idealism. His declaration that "Mental Things are alone Real" and that the "Corporeal" is "in Fallacy & its Existence an Imposture" (*Vision of the Last Judgment* [@blake1810judgment]) maps directly onto the epistemic structure of Active Inference: internal states (beliefs) are all we access. External states are inferred, never directly known. "Corporeal" = external states beyond the Markov blanket. We have no direct access to the world-in-itself; only to our model's predictions about it. What we call "corporeal" is a posit of inference, not an immediate given.

This is not solipsism but epistemic humility: acknowledging that all our knowledge is model-mediated.

### Knowledge by Perception, Not Deduction

Blake distinguishes parallel inference from serial reasoning:

> *"Knowledge is not by deduction but Immediate by Perception or Sense at once Christ addresses himself to the Man not to his Reason"*
>
> — Annotations to Berkeley's *Siris* [@blake1820berkeley]

Perception as parallel inference, not serial deduction. Posterior beliefs emerge from free energy minimization directly—not through step-by-step logical chains but through the simultaneous settling of the entire generative model. "Christ addresses himself to the Man" = the world speaks to the whole agent, not just the reasoning faculty.

This anticipates the Active Inference insight that perception is not a conclusion of reasoning but an immediate update of the entire belief distribution.

### Innate Ideas as Structural Priors

Against empiricist doctrine, Blake insists on innate structure:

> *"The Man who says that we have No Innate Ideas must be a Fool & Knave... Knowledge of Ideal Beauty is Not to be Acquired It is Born with us"*
>
> — Annotations to Reynolds' Discourses [@blake1808reynolds]

Structural priors are architectural, not learned. "Innate Ideas" = the priors that make inference possible. They cannot be "acquired" because they define the hypothesis space within which acquisition occurs. Without prior structure, there is nothing to update—no model to receive evidence.

### Imagination as Epistemic Foraging

If imagination is human existence—if the self *is* the generative model—then what Blake calls "creative vision" amounts to a specific computational strategy: *epistemic foraging* through counterfactual model-space. Rather than passively receiving data, the imaginative agent actively explores hypothetical configurations of its own generative model, testing alternatives that minimize expected free energy over long horizons [@veissiere2020thinking]. This is niche construction at the cognitive level: the imagination does not merely adapt to the world as found but actively reshapes the model-space within which future inference occurs. Blake's insistence that "What is now proved was once only imagin'd" is, in Active Inference terms, the claim that today's priors were yesterday's epistemic actions—imaginative explorations that became entrained belief structures. The artist, the prophet, the visionary is thus not an escapist but an *epistemic pioneer*, foraging at the frontier of model-space.
