*Situating the correspondence within existing scholarship.*

## Blake and Embodied Cognition

The mapping between Romantic poetry and cognitive science has precursors. Three pillars of Blake scholarship make our formal mapping possible. Northrop Frye's *Fearful Symmetry* [@frye1947fearful] established the systematic reading of Blake's symbolism as a coherent intellectual structure rather than private mythology. S. Foster Damon's *A Blake Dictionary* [@damon1988blake] provides the essential lexicon of Blake's symbolic system, establishing the correspondences among his mythological figures that a formal mapping requires. Peter Ackroyd's definitive biography [@ackroyd1995blake] demonstrates how Blake's visionary epistemology was inseparable from his lived practice as engraver, printer, and painter—an embodied creativity that resists reduction to disembodied ideas.

From the cognitive science side, two works converge on the same insight. Mark Johnson's *The Body in the Mind* [@johnson1987body] argues that abstract thought is grounded in embodied image schemas—exactly the kind of perceptual-motor structures that Active Inference formalizes as generative models. Lakoff and Johnson's *Metaphors We Live By* [@lakoff1980metaphors] demonstrated that conceptual structure is metaphorical and embodied, not abstract and propositional.

Blake anticipated both traditions by two centuries. His insistence that "Man has no Body distinct from his Soul" (MHH Plate 4) is not metaphor but proto-enactivism: the body is not a container for mind but the very medium of inference.

## Hemispheric Lateralization

Iain McGilchrist's *The Master and His Emissary* [@mcgilchrist2009master] proposes that the left hemisphere prioritizes narrow, focused, already-known categories while the right hemisphere attends to the broad, contextual, and novel. This lateralization maps suggestively onto Blake's mythology: Urizen (left hemisphere)---the lawgiver who "closed the tent of the Universe," imposing rigid categories---versus Los/Urthona (right hemisphere)---the creative imagination that builds Golgonooza, perpetually open to new form. McGilchrist's thesis that Western civilization has progressively over-valued left-hemispheric cognition parallels Blake's diagnosis of "Newton's sleep" as civilizational pathology.

McGilchrist's magisterial follow-up, *The Matter with Things* [@mcgilchrist2021matter], deepens this analysis with direct engagement with Blake. McGilchrist treats imagination not as mere fantasy but as a "key faculty" for revealing reality---echoing Blake's own elevation of imagination above reason. The dynamic tension of Blake's *Marriage of Heaven and Hell*, where "contraries" generate movement toward deeper consciousness, exemplifies what McGilchrist identifies as the right hemisphere's mode of understanding: holding opposites in creative tension rather than collapsing them into categories.

## Romanticism and the Science of Mind

Alan Richardson's *British Romanticism and the Science of the Mind* [@richardson2001british] documents how Romantic poets engaged seriously with contemporary brain science, not as opponents but as creative interlocutors. Richardson shows that the Romantic critique of mechanism was not anti-scientific but proto-cognitive---anticipating embodied, situated, and enactive approaches. Our paper extends Richardson's historical argument by providing the formal bridge: Active Inference supplies the mathematics that connects Blake's phenomenological observations to contemporary computational neuroscience.

## Neuroaesthetics

The emerging field of neuroaesthetics investigates how art engages perceptual and cognitive systems. Ramachandran and Hirstein [@ramachandran1999science] proposed that art exploits principles of perceptual processing---peak shift, isolation, and grouping. In Active Inference terms, art offers generative models that resolve free energy in novel ways, restructuring the viewer's predictions. Blake's illuminated books---integrating visual, verbal, and material elements into composite artworks---represent an extreme case: each plate offers not merely an aesthetic experience but a complete alternative generative model for perception.

## Social Neuroscience and Joint Improvisation

Recent work in social neuroscience and art therapy emphasizes the role of joint improvisation in synchronizing neural states. Mikhailova and Friedman's "Partner Pen Play in Parallel" (PPPiP) [@mikhailova2018partner] proposes that simultaneous, non-verbal co-creation on a shared surface facilitates "controlled novelty" and inter-brain synchrony. This practice operationalizes the Active Inference account of communication not merely as signal transmission but as the mutual alignment of generative models. Just as Blake's "fourfold vision" integrates diverse faculties, PPPiP demonstrates how shared aesthetic action can construct a "collective self-evidencing" dynamic, where the relationship itself becomes the agent minimizing surprise.

## Psychedelics and the Predictive Mind

Aldous Huxley's *The Doors of Perception* [@huxley1954doors]---its very title drawn from Blake---proposed that psychedelic experience reveals perception ordinarily filtered by the brain's "reducing valve." Carhart-Harris and Friston's REBUS model [@carthartharris2019rebus] formalized this intuition, showing that psychedelics reduce the precision of high-level priors. Safron and colleagues' ALBUS framework [@safron2025albus] now extends REBUS into a comprehensive account: psychedelics can both relax beliefs and strengthen them, producing the full spectrum of altered states from prior dissolution to intensified meaning-making. This is Blake's "cleansing" rendered computational---the doors of perception swing open when prior dynamics shift, allowing sensory evidence to reshape the model. The continuity from Blake through Huxley to ALBUS illustrates how the same phenomenological insight has been rediscovered across centuries and progressively formalized.

## Northrop Frye's Systematic Blake

Frye's *Fearful Symmetry* [@frye1947fearful] remains the foundational systematic treatment of Blake's mythology. Frye demonstrated that Blake's prophetic books constitute a coherent cosmological system, not isolated flights of fancy. Our paper depends on Frye's insight that Blake's symbolism is systematic---without that systematicity, the structural correspondences with Active Inference would dissolve into vague analogy. Where Frye mapped Blake's system as literary criticism, we map it as cognitive architecture.

## Comparative Systems: Blake and Fuller

While Frye elucidated the internal coherence of Blake's system, recent comparative work highlights Blake's role as a system-*builder* akin to modern comprehensivists. Friedman's study of Blake and Buckminster Fuller [@friedman2023blake] juxtaposes Blake's mythopoetic architecture with the Synergetics of Fuller and Ed J Applewhite. Both thinkers confronted the "single vision" of their respective eras---Newtonian mechanics for Blake, specialization and technocracy for Fuller---by constructing comprehensive, fourfold (or tetrahedral) epistemologies. This comparison underscores that Blake's "system" was not a static dogma but a dynamic *tool for thought*, designed to prevent enslavement by another's system.

## Phenomenological Traditions

The phenomenological tradition provides crucial methodological precedent. Merleau-Ponty's *Phenomenology of Perception* [@merleau1962phenomenology] argues that perception is fundamentally embodied---the body is not an object among objects but the condition of objecthood itself. This directly parallels Active Inference's claim that the Markov blanket *constitutes* the distinction between agent and environment. Blake's rejection of Cartesian dualism---"Man has no Body distinct from his Soul"---anticipates Merleau-Ponty's overcoming of the mind-body problem through embodied intentionality.

Husserl's concept of intentionality---that consciousness is always *consciousness of* something---prefigures the Active Inference insight that inference is always inference *about* hidden states. The noematic content (what is intended) depends on the noetic act (how it is intended), just as the posterior depends on how priors and likelihoods are weighted. Blake's "As a man is, so he sees" expresses this dependency of object on mode of perception.

## Extended Mind and 4E Cognition

Clark and Chalmers' "Extended Mind" thesis [@clark1998extended] argues that cognitive processes extend beyond the skull into environmental structures. This resonates with Blake's insistence that imagination is not a private mental faculty but participates in a cosmic creativity: "Man is All Imagination God is Man \& exists in us \& we in him." The recursive embedding---existing in each other---describes precisely the nested Markov blankets that enable multi-agent coordination.

The broader 4E cognition movement (embodied, embedded, enacted, extended) provides contemporary articulation of Blake's critique of disembodied reason. Varela, Thompson, and Rosch's *The Embodied Mind* [@varela1991embodied] argues for the inseparability of cognition from sensorimotor engagement---exactly Blake's claim that "Energy is Eternal Delight" and that perception requires active participation, not passive reception.

## Affect Theory and Precision Weighting

Contemporary affect theory illuminates the role of precision in shaping inference. Damasio's somatic marker hypothesis [@damasio1994descartes] proposes that emotional states guide decision-making by tagging options with bodily valence---a form of affective precision weighting. Blake's Luvah (passion) and his claim that "thought alone can make monsters, but the affections cannot" anticipates this: pure reasoning unmoored from bodily affect produces biologically non-viable conclusions.

Precision weighting in Active Inference formalizes what matters: high precision signals "attend to this." Affect theory recognizes that mattering is not cognitive but visceral---we *feel* significance before we reason about it. Blake's repeated insistence on passion, energy, and delight as constitutive of vision (not decorative enhancements) aligns with this affective grounding of inference.

## Predictive Processing and Aesthetic Experience

The application of predictive processing to aesthetics has matured rapidly. The 2024 *Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B* theme issue on art, aesthetics, and predictive processing [@vandecruys2024order] represents a watershed: for the first time, a major scientific journal dedicated an entire volume to exploring how the brain's predictive architecture shapes aesthetic engagement. Van de Cruys, Bervoets, and Moors argue that aesthetic experience arises from the interplay of order and change---precisely the dynamic Blake dramatized as the "Marriage of Heaven and Hell," where reason (order) and energy (change) are both "necessary to Human existence."

Kukkonen's *Probability Designs* [@kukkonen2020probability] extends predictive processing to literary engagement, modeling how readers generate predictions, encounter surprise, and update their models during narrative comprehension. This work provides methodological precedent for our approach: if predictive processing can illuminate how readers engage with novels, it can equally illuminate how Blake's prophetic structures engage the perceptual system.

## Consciousness as Controlled Hallucination

Anil Seth's *Being You* [@seth2021being] advances the thesis that all perception is a form of "controlled hallucination"---the brain's best guess about the causes of sensory signals, constrained but never determined by incoming evidence. This language---perception as active construction rather than passive reception---resonates strikingly with Blake's insistence that we see "through" the eye, not "with" it. Where Seth's framework emphasizes the constructive, model-dependent nature of all experience, Blake had already proclaimed: "A fool sees not the same tree that a wise man sees" (*Marriage of Heaven and Hell*, Plate 7). Both thinkers deny the Enlightenment premise that perception is simply the imprint of an external world on a passive receiver.

## Cognitive Romanticism

A new field is coalescing at the intersection of Romantic literary studies and cognitive science. Savarese's *Romanticism's Other Minds* [@savarese2020romanticism] reassesses early relationships between Romantic poetry and scientific thought, uncovering a "prehistory of cognitive approaches to literature" within the Romantic tradition itself. The Romantic poets---Wordsworth, Coleridge, Shelley, and Blake---were not merely literary figures but active theorists of mind, perception, and social cognition. Our paper extends this tradition by providing what the Romantics lacked: the formal apparatus to make their deepest intuitions computationally precise.

## Cultural Affordances and Shared Models

Veissière and colleagues [@veissiere2020thinking] apply Active Inference to cultural cognition, arguing that shared generative models---"thinking through other minds"---constitute the mechanism of cultural transmission and niche construction. Their framework treats culture not as a static repository of information but as a living system of shared priors, jointly updated through epistemic foraging and cooperative action. This directly informs our reading of Blake's Jerusalem: the city is not merely a utopian vision but a formally specifiable shared generative niche, constructed and maintained through the "Mental Fight" of collective inference.

## Our Contribution

Prior scholarship has noted resonances between Romantic thought and cognitive science at the level of general themes (embodiment, creativity, the limits of mechanism). Our paper is the first to provide *specific formal mappings* between Blake's prophetic system and the mathematical apparatus of Active Inference. We move beyond analogy to structural correspondence: identifying not merely thematic overlap but shared topology (the Markov blanket as Blake's door), shared dynamics (free energy minimization as cleansing), and shared architecture (hierarchical generative models as fourfold vision). This synthesis arrives at a moment when both fields---predictive processing aesthetics and cognitive Romanticism---are independently converging on the same questions. Our contribution is to continue work on that bridge (or at least point towards the gap to be respected!).
