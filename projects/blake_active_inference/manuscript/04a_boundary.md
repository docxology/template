### The Markov Blanket

The cherub's flaming sword is the guardian of a boundary---the partition between accessible and inaccessible states. Blake's "door" is Friston's *boundary*—the statistical partition separating internal from external states:

> "The Markov blanket defines what is inside vs. outside any autonomous system—the statistical partition separating internal from external states."
>
> — Kirchhoff et al. (2018) [@kirchhoff2018markov]

This IS Blake's "door"—the boundary that mediates all contact between self and world. The blanket is constitutive, not optional.

| Blanket Component | Symbol | Blake's Image |
|:------------------|:-------|:--------------|
| External states | $\eta$ | "the Infinite" beyond |
| Sensory states | $s$ | Inflow through doors |
| Active states | $a$ | Outflow through doors |
| Internal states | $\mu$ | The perceiver in the "cavern" |
| Blanket | $B$ | "The doors of perception" |

This conditional independence structure (Equation \ref{eq:conditional_independence}) means that the blanket mediates all contact. Internal states access external states *only* through the interface. The doors are not optional---they are constitutive.

Blake's "cavern" is not metaphor but *phenomenology*: the subjective space of one whose doors are narrowed. The "chinks" are the impoverished sensory channels of a rigid generative model.

Blake articulated this boundary condition repeatedly. The bounded itself produces suffering:

> *"The Bounded is loathed by its possessor. The same dull round, even of a Universe, would soon become a Mill with complicated wheels."*
>
> — *There is No Natural Religion*, Series B [@blake1788natural]

Yet energy is the fundamental currency crossing the boundary:

> *"Energy is the only life and is from the Body and Reason is the bound or outward circumference of Energy. Energy is Eternal Delight."*
>
> — *Marriage of Heaven and Hell*, Plate 4 [@blake1790marriage]

Blake identifies Reason as the "bound"---the circumference or blanket edge that delimits the system. Energy, by contrast, is the vital flow that crosses this boundary. From this distinction follows his foundational claim about the nature of perception:

> *"Man's Perceptions are not bounded by Organs of Perception; he perceives more than Sense (tho' ever so acute) can discover."*
>
> — *There is No Natural Religion*, Series B [@blake1788natural]

The Markov blanket is necessary but not sufficient. The door mediates; cleansing transforms how it mediates. Figure \ref{fig:doors} illustrates this statistical boundary and its Blakean phenomenology.

> **Same door. Different cleansing.** The friend's perception is not wrong—but it is shallow. Blake's perception engages deeper layers of the generative model. Both are valid inferences; one draws on vastly more model depth.

### Boundary Constitution: Naming Creates Separation

Blake understood that boundaries are *constituted*, not given. The act of naming creates the inside/outside distinction:

> *"they gave to it a Space & namd the Space Ulro"*
>
> — *Vala, or The Four Zoas*, Night the First [@blake1797fourzoas, E303]

The Markov blanket is not discovered but *constituted*. "Naming the Space" IS boundary formation. Ulro—Blake's realm of materialist limitation—comes into being through the act of partition.

### The Abyss as KL-Divergence

When Urizen separates from Ahania (his emanation, his feminine counterpart), Blake describes the resulting gap in terms that directly anticipate information-theoretic distance:

> *"Ahania (so name his parted soul)... how wide the Abyss Between Ahania and thee!"*
>
> — *The Book of Ahania*, Chapter III [@blake1795ahania]

This "Abyss" evokes information-theoretic distance—the separation between states that should be unified. Blake's mythic language of partition anticipates what Active Inference formalizes as divergence between distributions. The "parted soul" represents a split generative model; the wider the Abyss, the greater the separation.

### Forged Boundaries

The blanket is not simply given and absolute, but *constructed*:

> *"He forg'd nets of iron around"*
>
> — *The Book of Ahania* [@blake1795ahania]

"Forging" emphasizes the active construction and identification of boundary conditions. The Markov blanket is manufactured materially and mentally. This has profound implications: what is forged can be reforged, and what is identified can be mis- and re-identified.

### Body as Blanket Interface

Blake's most direct statement of embodied cognition anticipates the blanket formalism:

> *"Man has no Body distinct from his Soul for that calld Body is a portion of Soul discernd by the five Senses, the chief inlets of Soul in this age"*
>
> — *Marriage of Heaven and Hell*, Plate 4 [@blake1790marriage]

"Inlets" = sensory states $s$. The body IS how mind interfaces with world—not a separate substance but the blanket itself. No ontological separation exists; only the functional partition of the blanket.

### Imagination's Outline vs. Nature's Dissolution

Blake's late work makes explicit the distinction between raw data and model structure:

> *"Nature has no Outline: but Imagination has. Nature has no Tune: but Imagination has. Nature has no Supernatural & dissolves: Imagination is Eternity"*
>
> — *The Ghost of Abel*, Plate 1 [@blake1822abel]

Nature (observations $o$) is unstructured flow. Imagination (the generative model $p(o, \theta)$) provides boundaries, form, temporal structure ("Tune"). The model is more real than the data because it is what makes data *intelligible*. Without the model's outline, perception dissolves into chaos.

### Contemporary Resonance: From Blake Through Huxley to ALBUS

The lineage from Blake's "Doors" to contemporary neuroscience runs through a single remarkable chain. Aldous Huxley borrowed Blake's phrase for *The Doors of Perception* [@huxley1954doors], proposing that the brain operates as a "reducing valve" filtering the totality of experience into manageable form. Carhart-Harris and Friston's REBUS model [@carthartharris2019rebus] formalized this intuition by showing that psychedelics relax the precision of high-level priors. Safron and colleagues' ALBUS framework [@safron2025albus] now extends this account: psychedelics do not merely relax beliefs (REBUS) but can also strengthen them (SEBUS), producing a richer taxonomy of altered states—from the dissolution of rigid priors to the intensification of meaning-making. The result encompasses Blake's "cleansing"—not the destruction of the boundary but the recalibration of its precision weighting, allowing prediction error to propagate more freely up the hierarchy. What Blake described as seeing "every thing... as it is: infinite" corresponds to a state of altered prior dynamics where sensory evidence reshapes inference rather than being suppressed by entrenched expectations. This is not metaphor: it is the same computational operation described in different vocabularies across three centuries.

![**The Doors of Perception as Markov Blanket.** The statistical boundary ($B = \{s, a\}$) partitions external states $\eta$ ("the Infinite") from internal states $\mu$ ("the Cavern") through two complementary channels: sensory states $s$ mediating world-to-self flow (observation, perception) and active states $a$ mediating self-to-world flow (action, decision). This implements Blake's phenomenology from *The Marriage of Heaven and Hell*, Plate 14: "If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is, Infinite. For man has closed himself up, till he sees all things thro' narrow chinks of his cavern" [@blake1790marriage]. The blanket is constitutive---not an optional filter but the necessary interface through which all inference occurs. Cleansing the doors corresponds to optimizing the model's precision weighting (Equation \ref{eq:conditional_independence}), not to eliminating the boundary itself.](../output/figures/fig1_doors_of_perception.png){#fig:doors}
