Blake discovered through phenomenological observation what Active Inference formalizes mathematically—two centuries before the equations existed.

## The Threshold

Our title captures the synthesis:

**The Doors of Perception are the Threshold of Prediction.**

For both Blake and Friston, perception occurs at a boundary---door or blanket (Equation \ref{eq:conditional_independence}; Figure \ref{fig:doors})---separating self from world. The boundary is not passive but *predictive*: anticipating, shaping, generating experience.

> *"If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is: infinite."*
>
> — Blake [@blake1790marriage]

In Active Inference: if the generative model were optimally calibrated, prediction error (Equation \ref{eq:prediction_error}) would minimize across all hierarchical levels (Equation \ref{eq:hierarchical_model}; Figure \ref{fig:fourfold}). The "Infinite" is not mystical beyond but *vast information content* that rigid priors and shallow hierarchies fail to access.

## Newton Still Sleeps

The critique remains devastatingly relevant. The danger is not reason but *absolutized* reason—single vision elevated to only vision.

Active Inference provides tools for understanding this danger computationally:

- Excessive prior precision
- Rigid model architecture  
- Shallow hierarchical processing

All produce impoverished perception. The remedy is not irrationalism but *expanded rationality*: richer models, flexible precision, deeper hierarchies.

Contemporary manifestations of Newton's sleep abound. Algorithmic attention capture—social media feeds optimized for engagement—represents industrial-scale prior dominance: platforms that systematically increase the precision of a narrow set of priors (outrage, novelty, social comparison) while suppressing the broader, slower processing that fourfold vision requires. The result is a civilization of "narrow chinks"—millions of caverns, algorithmically reinforced. Similarly, the challenges of AI alignment can be understood as the problem of building generative models that lack Tharmas and Luvah: systems that reason (Urizen) and create (Los) but cannot feel (Luvah) or be embodied (Tharmas). Blake's mythology suggests that such factorized models, missing their affective and interoceptive components, will inevitably produce "monsters"—logically coherent but existentially catastrophic outcomes.

## The Reciprocal Gift

The synthesis is not one-directional. Blake gives Active Inference what formalism alone cannot provide: a phenomenological vocabulary for the felt experience of inference, a taxonomy of failure modes grounded in lived perception ("Newton's sleep," "Ulro," "single vision"), and the insistence that mathematical description is not exhaustive description. Active Inference gives Blake what prophetic vision alone cannot achieve: mathematical precision, empirical testability, and a bridge to contemporary neuroscience that demonstrates these are not archaic metaphors but accurate structural descriptions of cognitive architecture. Neither tradition is complete without the other. The equations need the visions; the visions need the equations.

## Building Jerusalem

Blake envisioned collective awakening—"Jerusalem" as shared visionary capacity.

In Active Inference: cultural generative models (Equation \ref{eq:multi_agent}) enabling richer collective inference. Education, art, contemplative practice, cultural production---all shape the models through which communities perceive.

> *"I will not cease from Mental Fight,*  
> *Nor shall my Sword sleep in my hand:*  
> *Till we have built Jerusalem,*  
> *In England's green & pleasant Land."*
>
> — *Milton*, Preface [@blake1804milton]

The Mental Fight is model-building at civilizational scale. Shared priors enable coordinated perception. The awakening is collective.

## Future Directions

Three research programs emerge from this synthesis:

1. **Computational modeling of fourfold vision.** Using tools such as `pymdp` (the standard Python implementation of Active Inference [@heins2022pymdp]), one could construct hierarchical generative models of varying depth and test whether the phenomenological differences Blake describes between single, twofold, threefold, and fourfold vision correspond to quantifiable differences in model evidence, prediction error profile, and temporal horizon.

2. **Cross-cultural precision modulation.** If Blake's "cleansing" maps to precision rebalancing, then contemplative practices across traditions—Zen kōan study, Sufi *dhikr*, Buddhist *vipassanā*, psychedelic-assisted therapy—may achieve analogous effects through culturally specific means. Comparative studies using the Active Inference framework could identify shared computational mechanisms beneath surface diversity.

3. **Neuroaesthetic experiments.** Blake's illuminated plates could be used as stimuli in fMRI and EEG studies designed to test whether viewing visionary art modulates precision weighting in ways consistent with the ALBUS framework—specifically, whether exposure to Blake's composite imagery alters the balance between high-level priors and sensory precision, producing measurable shifts toward "cleansed perception."

## Final Reflection

Revolutionary London around the turn of the 19th century. Computational neuroscience around the turn of the 21st. Two centuries, an age apart, one shared Golden Thread.

The human situation admits description from radically different perspectives—poetic and mathematical, Romantic and computational, prophetic and scientific.

Phenomenological observation and formal modeling are not antagonists but *partners*. Blake's visions, and scientific equations, are different doors opening onto the same threshold—the boundary at which prediction meets reality. In the spirit of the Glass Bead Game, we have played these two great systems with one another not to declare a winner, but to reveal the hidden harmony of their structures.
