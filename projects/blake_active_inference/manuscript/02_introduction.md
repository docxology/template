## The Threshold {#threshold}

Between perceiver and perceived lies a boundary. Blake called it a door. In causal inference, that boundary may be called a blanket. The exoteric syntax differs; the esoteric semantics does not.

William Blake (1757–1827) composed his prophetic works during the consolidation of Newtonian mechanism—the reduction of cosmos to clockwork, of vision to optics, of mind to matter arranged [@raine1968blake]. His response was not retreat into mysticism but a vigorous *expansion*: a fourfold epistemology that could contain Newton's single vision while transcending it.

The Active Inference framework, developed by a growing community of researchers worldwide, offers a formal complement to Blake's insights. The free energy principle formalizes how self-organizing systems maintain existence by minimizing prediction error [@friston2010free]. Perception and action unite in a single imperative—to reduce the gap between expectation and evidence.

This paper explores how Blake's intuitions and Active Inference's equations resonate. The former prophesied; the latter formalizes. We do not claim that Blake was a proto-Bayesian statistician, nor that Active Inference is a "Blakean" science, but rather that both systems grapple with the same fundamental problem: how a bounded agent maintains its existence and makes sense of an infinite world. We offer a *synthetic juxtapositional intelligence*—placing the poet's vision alongside the physicist's variables to reveal the structural identity of their insights.

The spirit of this enterprise owes something to Hesse's *Glass Bead Game*: an abstract synthesis of all arts and sciences, where the player discovers hidden affinities between seemingly unrelated disciplines [@hesse1943glass]. Like Hesse's Castalian scholars, we do not seek to reduce one tradition to the other, but to illuminate the structural resonances that emerge when both are held in the same contemplative field.

This synthesis arrives at a moment of convergence. On one side, predictive processing and active inference are being applied with increasing sophistication to aesthetics and literary engagement—most notably in the 2024 *Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B* theme issue on art and predictive processing [@vandecruys2024order], and in Kukkonen's work modeling literary experience through prediction error [@kukkonen2020probability]. On the other, cognitive approaches to Romanticism are deepening: Savarese's *Romanticism's Other Minds* [@savarese2020romanticism] reveals a "prehistory of cognitive approaches to literature" within the Romantic tradition itself. Our paper sits at the intersection of these two currents, offering what neither can alone: the formal mathematics that makes the poetic claim testable, and the phenomenological richness that makes the formalism legible.

## The Correspondences {#correspondences}

Eight thematic correspondences anchor our synthesis (see [Thematic Atlas](#tbl-themes)):

| Theme | Blake's Term | Active Inference Term |
|:------|:-------------|:----------------------|
| **Boundary** | Doors of Perception | Markov Blanket |
| **Vision** | Fourfold Vision | Hierarchical Processing |
| **States** | Newton's Sleep | Prior Dominance |
| **Imagination** | Human Existence | Generative Model |
| **Time** | Eternity in an Hour | Temporal Horizons |
| **Space** | World in a Grain of Sand | Spatial Inference |
| **Action** | Cleansing | Free Energy Minimization |
| **Collectives** | Building Jerusalem | Shared Generative Models |

## Method {#method}

We proceed now through three main movements:

- **§2**: Related scholarship: Blake and cognition, Romanticism and neuroscience, situating our contribution
- **§3**: Theoretical Foundations: free energy, Markov blankets, precision
- **§4**: Synthesis: eight themed correspondences with equations and figures

Each theme in our synthesis ([Thematic Atlas](#tbl-themes)) begins with Blake's fire, then traces its mathematical shadow. The conclusion ([§5–6](#implications)) draws implications for philosophy of mind, cognitive science, and creativity, while engaging counter-arguments and acknowledging limitations.
