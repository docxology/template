## Philosophy of Mind

### The Romantic Computational Mind

The foregoing synthesis raises fundamental questions for philosophy of mind, cognitive science, and how we understand the relationship between artistic and scientific knowledge. If Blake's phenomenological observations and Friston's mathematical framework describe the same cognitive architecture, then the Romantic tradition is not anti-cognitive but proto-computational—articulating in the language of vision what neuroscience would later formalize.

Blake's "As a man is, so he sees" is not merely prescient metaphor; it is a precise statement of the Active Inference thesis that perception is model-dependent inference. The convergence suggests that phenomenological observation and formal modeling approach the same cognitive reality from different directions, each illuminating what the other cannot express. Against McGinn's "mysterianism"—the claim that consciousness constitutes an irresolvable problem for human cognition [@mcginn2004consciousness]—the Blake–Active Inference synthesis suggests a third way: neither reductive explanation nor mysterian agnosticism, but phenomenological-formal complementarity, where visionary description and mathematical formalism illuminate different facets of the same cognitive architecture.

### Consciousness as Hierarchical Depth

Blake's fourfold hierarchy (Figure \ref{fig:fourfold}) implies degrees of awareness. Single vision is diminished consciousness. Fourfold vision is full integration.

If cleansed perception = optimized free energy minimization (Equation \ref{eq:cleansing}), then consciousness correlates with well-calibrated generative models. The dimness of Newton's sleep is computational: poor precision weighting (Equation \ref{eq:prior_dominance}) produces impoverished inference, collapsing the prediction error signal (Equation \ref{eq:prediction_error}). Conversely, expanded consciousness corresponds to deeper hierarchical models that compress more temporal structure (Equation \ref{eq:temporal_hierarchy}) and richer spatial detail (Equation \ref{eq:model_complexity}) into unified awareness.

## Cognitive Science

### Predictions

Three empirical implications follow from the Blake–Active Inference correspondence:

1. **Expert perception** — If fourfold vision reflects hierarchical depth, then artists and naturalists should exhibit richer hierarchical representations than novices. Studies of perceptual expertise in visual art [@chamberlain2013perceptual] already document enhanced configural processing in trained observers, consistent with deeper generative models.

2. **Precision modulation** — Contemplative practices that adjust precision weighting should alter perceptual content in predictable ways. Meditation traditions emphasizing open monitoring (reduced prior precision) versus focused attention (increased sensory precision) provide natural experimental conditions for testing Blake's claim that perception varies with the "Organs of Perception."

3. **Psychedelic states** — Substances that alter precision constraints should produce Blake-like perception of infinite detail. The ALBUS framework [@safron2025albus], extending the earlier REBUS model [@carthartharris2019rebus], formalizes this prediction: psychedelics can both relax and strengthen beliefs, reshaping the balance between prior expectations and sensory evidence---precisely the "cleansing" Blake described.

### Neural Correlates

The contrast between "guinea sun" and "Heavenly Host" implies differentiated processing. Neuroimaging could investigate whether aesthetic transport exhibits relaxed prior precision and enhanced sensory processing.

## Creativity

### The Artist as Model-Builder

If imagination = generative model, then creativity = model construction.

Blake's illuminated books—integrating poetry, image, and print—instantiate this claim. Each work offers a generative model to the viewer, restructuring their perception.

### Aesthetic Free Energy

Great art offers models that resolve more free energy (Equation \ref{eq:free_energy}) than ordinary perception---making more sense of more experience.

> *"To the eyes of the man of imagination, nature is imagination itself."*
>
> — Blake [@blake1810judgment]

The developed perceiver experiences nature as already structured. The generative model meets itself in the world.

## Transpersonal Experience

### Mystical Perception

Blake's visions—"the Innumerable company of the Heavenly Host"—admit computational interpretation: extreme precision relaxation allowing radical belief update.

Mysticism on this account is not separate reality but *profound model revision*. The doors swing so wide that habitual priors dissolve.

### Building Jerusalem {#jerusalem}

Blake's vision of Jerusalem as collective awakening maps directly onto the multi-agent framework: Jerusalem = shared generative model (Equation \ref{eq:multi_agent}) = collective prior enabling coordinated perception. The Mental Fight---the tireless labor of model-building---operates at civilizational scale, reshaping shared priors through education, art, contemplative practice, and cultural production.

## Counter-Arguments

Four objections deserve explicit engagement:

**The Overfitting Objection.** Any sufficiently general mathematical framework can be mapped onto any sufficiently general philosophy; the Blake–Active Inference correspondence may reflect the breadth of both systems rather than genuine structural alignment. We concede that generality increases the risk of spurious correspondence. However, the specificity of our mappings---not merely "Blake values perception" but "Blake's fourfold hierarchy structurally mirrors the factorization of hierarchical generative models"---resists this charge. The correspondences are not one-to-one between vague themes but between precise structural features: boundary topology, precision dynamics, temporal depth, multi-agent factorization.

**The Anachronism Objection.** Blake intended no Active Inference meanings; reading them into his work is historical projection. This objection applies to all retrospective intellectual history. We do not claim that Blake *intended* to describe Markov blankets. We claim that the phenomenological structures he observed and articulated in his prophetic poetry exhibit formal properties that Active Inference independently identifies. Convergent description does not require shared intention---Darwin and Wallace converged on natural selection without coordination.

**The Formalization Objection.** Poetry resists equations; translating Blake's visionary language into mathematical notation inevitably loses what makes it meaningful. We agree that the translation is lossy. The formal apparatus captures structural relations---topology, dynamics, factorization---but not the affective, aesthetic, and spiritual dimensions of Blake's work. The equations are not replacements for the poetry but supplements: making explicit what the poetry implies about the architecture of perception. The two languages illuminate different aspects of the same cognitive reality.

**The Selectivity Objection.** The paper cherry-picks favorable passages while ignoring Blake's many statements that resist computational interpretation---his antinomianism, his mythological personifications, his explicit hostility to "Newton's Particles of light." We acknowledge selection. Our eight themes represent the strongest structural correspondences, not the totality of Blake's thought. Blake's anti-Newtonian polemic, far from undermining our thesis, *supports* it: his critique targets precisely the "single vision" (shallow, prior-locked inference) that Active Inference identifies as pathological. The correspondence holds not despite Blake's hostility to mechanism but *because* of it.

**The Presentism Objection.** The most subtle risk is that we are committing "presentism"---reading modern scientific concepts back into a historical figure whose intellectual context was radically different. Blake's sources were Swedenborg, Boehme, and the Book of Ezekiel, not Helmholtz or Bayes. We take this objection seriously. Our claim is not causal (that Blake influenced neuroscience) but *structural* (that his phenomenological observations and the formal framework converge on the same cognitive architecture). The defense against presentism is specificity: vague analogies between "Romanticism" and "creativity" would indeed be presentist, but precise mappings between Blake's fourfold hierarchy and the factorization of hierarchical generative models resist this charge precisely because they are falsifiable. If the structural correspondences broke down under scrutiny---if Blake's categories did not map onto computationally distinct operations---the project would fail. That they hold is evidence of convergent insight, not anachronistic projection.

## Limitations

**Scope.** This paper treats Blake's perceptual philosophy through the lens of a single formal framework. Other formalisms---enactivism, dynamical systems theory, integrated information theory---might illuminate different aspects of Blake's vision. The Active Inference lens is not exhaustive.

**Empirical standing.** The predictions generated in §5.2 remain untested. While the ALBUS framework (extending the earlier REBUS model) provides some indirect support for the psychedelic prediction, and expertise studies align with the hierarchical depth prediction, no experiment has been designed to test the Blake–Active Inference correspondence directly. Future work should operationalize specific predictions---for example, measuring hierarchical model depth in experienced contemplatives versus novices using computational phenotyping.

**Translation fidelity.** The Erdman edition provides our textual authority, but Blake's composite art---where image, text, and color form a unified expression---resists reduction to quotation. Our analysis necessarily privileges the verbal component of works that Blake designed as visual-verbal wholes. The illuminated books demand a richer formalism than equations alone can provide.

**Historical context.** Blake's religious commitments---his unorthodox Christianity, his engagement with Swedenborg and Boehme, his prophetic self-understanding---provide the matrix within which his perceptual philosophy developed. Abstracting his insights into secular computational language risks stripping away the very context that gave them meaning. We proceed with awareness that translation always transforms.

## Contemporary Applications

The Blake-Active Inference synthesis is not merely historical—it illuminates contemporary challenges at the intersection of artificial intelligence, mental health, and embodied robotics. In each domain, Blake's phenomenological vocabulary provides intuitive access to formal mechanisms that would otherwise remain opaque.

### AI Consciousness and Machine Imagination

Blake's claim that "Imagination is Human Existence Itself" speaks directly to contemporary debates about machine consciousness. If the self *is* the generative model, what of artificial generative models? Blake's framework suggests consciousness requires not merely prediction but *creative* model-building—the capacity to "Create a System" rather than merely optimize within one. Furthermore, his Four Zoas (Equation \ref{eq:factorized_model}) suggest consciousness requires embodiment (Tharmas) and affective grounding (Luvah)—dimensions absent from current AI systems.

### Mental Health Interventions

The synthesis illuminates mechanisms underlying several therapeutic modalities:

- **Psychedelic therapy**: The ALBUS framework formalizes Blake's "door cleansing" as precision modulation—encompassing both the relaxation of rigid beliefs and the strengthening of therapeutic insights—explaining therapeutic effects through prior restructuring.
- **Cognitive-behavioral therapy**: CBT operates through prior revision—identifying and restructuring the "mind-forg'd manacles" of automatic thoughts.
- **Contemplative practice**: Meditation traditions cultivate what Blake called "flexible senses"—the capacity to modulate precision dynamically rather than remaining locked in prior-dominated inference.
- **Narrative therapy**: Blake's distinction between "States" and "Identities" anticipates the therapeutic move from fixed trait identification to fluid state recognition.

### Embodied AI and Multi-Agent Coordination

Active Inference robotics embodies Blake's perception-action unity—artificial agents that perceive *through* acting, not merely before acting. Blake's "Energy is Eternal Delight" provides a phenomenological gloss on the utility-free motivation of free energy minimization: agents seek not pleasure but self-evidence.

Multi-agent robotic coordination—swarm robotics, collaborative manipulation—instantiates "Building Jerusalem" at the material level: shared generative models enabling collective action without centralized control. Blake's vision of "Universal Brotherhood" among the Zoas maps onto the coordination problem in multi-agent systems: how can diverse inference modes harmonize without homogenization?

### Emerging Field Convergence

This synthesis sits at the intersection of two rapidly converging fields: predictive processing approaches to aesthetics [@vandecruys2024order] and cognitive approaches to Romanticism [@savarese2020romanticism]. The convergence is not coincidental—both fields independently arrived at the same fundamental question: how does the brain's predictive architecture shape creative experience? The Phil Trans B 2024 theme issue demonstrates that the neuroscience community now takes aesthetic prediction error seriously as a research program. Simultaneously, literary scholars increasingly recognize that the Romantic poets were sophisticated theorists of mind, not naïve pre-scientific mystics. Our contribution bridges these fields by providing what neither has yet achieved: a formal, equation-level mapping between a specific historical poet's cognitive phenomenology and the mathematical apparatus of contemporary computational neuroscience.
