### Hierarchical Generative Models

Golgonooza---Blake's city of art, built by the imagination---provides the architectural metaphor for hierarchical inference: fourfold in every direction, each level nested within the others. The predictive brain generates perception actively:

> "The brain is revealed as an active, generative organ: one that continually predicts its own current sensory states, using those predictions to explain away the incoming sensory signal."
>
> — [@clark2013whatever]

This bidirectional cascade IS perception—errors ascend, predictions descend:

> "Feedback connections from a higher- to a lower-order visual cortical area carry predictions of lower-level neural activities, whereas the feedforward connections carry the residual errors between the predictions and the actual lower-level activities."
>
> — [@rao1999predictive]

Four levels of perception correspond to four depths of the generative hierarchy:

| Blake Level | Symbol | Cognitive Mode | Processing |
|:------------|:-------|:---------------|:-----------|
| **Single** (Ulro) | $\theta_1$ | Quantitative | Sensory features |
| **Twofold** (Generation) | $\theta_2$ | Emotional | Affective encoding |
| **Threefold** (Beulah) | $\theta_3$ | Imaginative | Symbolic integration |
| **Fourfold** (Jerusalem) | $\theta_4$ | Unified | Complete model engagement |

**Fourfold hierarchical factorization:**

\begin{equation}\label{eq:fourfold_hierarchy}
p(o, \theta_{1:4}) = p(o | \theta_1) \prod_{i=1}^{3} p(\theta_i | \theta_{i+1}) \cdot p(\theta_4)
\end{equation}

Fourfold vision engages all levels of the hierarchy (Equation \ref{eq:fourfold_hierarchy}; see Figure \ref{fig:fourfold}). Single vision collapses to $\theta_1$ alone, reducing the general hierarchical model (Equation \ref{eq:hierarchical_model}) to a single layer. The hierarchy is not ornament---it is the architecture of meaning.

Blake grasped this hierarchical principle:

> *"The Eye sees more than the Heart knows."*
>

Even the lower level (eye/sensation) accesses more than higher cognition (heart/understanding) can process. The crooked roads of genius circumvent linear reasoning:

> *"Improvement makes strait roads; but the crooked roads without Improvement are roads of Genius."*
>
> — *Marriage of Heaven and Hell*, Proverbs of Hell [@blake1790marriage]

Hierarchy need not mean rigid order—the genius finds shortcuts through visionary compression. Worton's analysis of Blake's intertextuality reveals that these "crooked roads" function as radical reconfigurations of existing models, not mere deviations from linearity [@worton1982blake].

### Golgonooza: The Architecture of the Generative Model

Blake's mythic city Golgonooza—the city of art, built by Los the imagination—provides a structural diagram of hierarchical inference. Recall the passage quoted at the opening of this section: "fourfold toward the north / And toward the south fourfold, & fourfold toward the east & west / Each within other toward the four points."

Four directions = four hierarchical levels. "Each within other" = nested structure. Golgonooza IS the generative model's architecture—a city that is simultaneously spatial and cognitive, built from the material of imagination itself.

The fourfold structure extends in all dimensions: north/south/east/west map to the Four Zoas (Urthona/Urizen/Luvah/Tharmas), each representing a distinct mode of inference. The city is not static but perpetually under construction—Los labors at the furnaces, continually rebuilding the model.

### Organs of Perception as Model-Dependent

Blake makes explicit that perception is not passive reception but active model-dependent construction:

> *"Creating Space, Creating Time... such was the variation of Time & Space, which vary according as the Organs of Perception vary"*
>
> — *Jerusalem*, Plate 98 [@blake1804jerusalem]

Space and time are not objective containers but generative model outputs. Different models produce different space-times. The "Organs of Perception" are not fixed biological apparatus but the structure of inference itself—and this structure can vary.

This anticipates the Active Inference insight that even basic phenomenal properties like spatial extent and temporal duration are inferred, not given. The model creates the coordinate system within which observations are interpreted.

Anil Seth's contemporary formulation crystallizes this point: all perception is a "controlled hallucination"—the brain's best guess about the causes of sensory signals, constrained but not determined by incoming evidence [@seth2021being]. Blake's fourfold vision is, in these terms, a taxonomy of hallucination depths: single vision is a shallow, rigid hallucination dominated by sensory constraint; fourfold vision is a deep, flexible hallucination where the generative model's own creative structure participates fully in what is perceived. The "fool" and the "wise man" who see different trees are running different models on the same data—and both perceptions are, in Seth's precise sense, controlled hallucinations.

Blake was acutely aware that deeper vision is not merely unseen but actively *pathologized* by the regime of single vision. In *Milton*, he names this suppression directly:

> *"Calling the Human Imagination: which is the Divine Vision & Fruition*
> *In which Man liveth eternally: madness & blasphemy, against*
> *Its own Qualities, which are Servants of Humanity, not Gods or Lords."*
>
> — *Milton*, Plate 32 [@blake1804milton]

"Madness & blasphemy" is the diagnostic frame that prior-dominated inference applies to perception that exceeds its own model. From within Newton's Sleep, fourfold vision looks pathological precisely because the shallow model cannot represent the hierarchical depth that makes it possible—it can only classify what it cannot compute as error, delusion, or transgression. Blake's counter-move is to insist that imagination's "Qualities" are "Servants of Humanity, not Gods or Lords": the deeper levels of the generative model serve the agent's self-evidencing; they are not external authorities but functional capacities. This anticipates contemporary debates in psychedelic neuroscience, where expanded perceptual states—once dismissed as mere hallucination—are increasingly recognized as alternative precision regimes with their own epistemic validity [@carthartharris2019rebus].

![**The Fourfold Vision Hierarchy.** Blake's four perceptual levels mapped to corresponding depths of the Active Inference hierarchical generative model (Equation \ref{eq:fourfold_hierarchy}). **Single Vision** (Ulro, $\theta_1$, gray): quantitative sensory registration---"Newton's sleep," seeing a rose as cells and chemistry. **Twofold Vision** (Generation, $\theta_2$, blue): emotional-intellectual engagement---perceiving beauty, desire, and symbolic meaning. **Threefold Vision** (Beulah, $\theta_3$, purple): imaginative synthesis---"soft Beulah's night," where contraries reconcile in art and myth. **Fourfold Vision** (Jerusalem, $\theta_4$, gold): full hierarchical integration---"supreme delight," unified engagement of all model depths.
