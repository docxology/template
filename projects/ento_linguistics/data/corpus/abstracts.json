  "The role of DNA methylation in regulating transcriptional activity and post-transcriptional modifications in insects, particularly in social insects, remains debated. Social insect castes, primarily determined by differential gene expression, exhibit pronounced phenotypic differences in morphology, life history traits and behaviour. In some ants, parasites induce divergent phenotypes, but the role of DNA methylation in this remains poorly understood. In this study, we examined DNA methylation patterns across different tissues (brain and fat body) and castes (queens and workers) in the ant Temnothorax nylanderi. We also compared healthy workers with those infected with the cestode Anomotaenia brevis, which is associated with changes in lifespan, morphology and behaviour. Our results reveal significant differences in gene body methylation across tissues, which were positively linked to gene expression. We also observed caste-specific differences in DNA methylation, particularly in the fat body. Surprisingly, however, we detected no differences in DNA methylation between cestode-infected and healthy workers, despite pronounced differences in transcriptional activity, suggesting that other epigenetic mechanisms exert stronger regulatory control over parasite-induced transcriptional changes. The pronounced differences in DNA methylation between tissues and castes, partly associated with transcriptional variation, warrant further investigation into their functional role, including the modulation of alternative splicing.",
  "DNA methylation has been proposed as an epigenetic driver of phenotypic plasticity in social insects, yet experimental evidence remains limited. Even less is known about the role of epigenetic mechanisms underlying behavioural and social polymorphism. We quantified CpG methylation for the socially polymorphic harvester ant Pogonomyrmex californicus across larvae, pupae, workers and queens using Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing. These results were compared against the current gold standard whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS). Methylation sites were highly correlated between WGBS and ONT, validating the use of ONT for high-throughput epigenomic profiling. Genome-wide methylation was low (~3%), consistent with findings in other (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), and highly clustered within gene bodies, especially exons, while introns, intergenic DNA, promoters and transposable elements were hypo-methylated. Gene body methylation (GBM) correlated positively with gene expression in queens, corroborating previous reports for other insects, suggesting a conserved regulatory role for DNA methylation in insects. A comparison between developmental stages revealed significant stage-specific differences in GBM frequencies. Workers and queens, although from different populations, shared a substantial core of methylated loci enriched for olfactory-receptor activity and biosynthetic pathways, processes that are central to caste-specific behaviour and physiology. These shared methylation signatures, coupled with stage-dependent variability, highlight DNA methylation as a possible factor in developmental stages and caste differentiation. In the future, it is essential to disentangle the effects of caste and variation between populations. Our study establishes P. californicus as a powerful model for dissecting how epigenetic modifications interface with gene expression to generate developmental and complex social organization, which is largely unexplored.",
  "Ants exhibit remarkable collective and social behaviors, such as alloparental care,1 chemical communication,2 homing,3 and cooperative group hygiene.4 The clonal raider ant Ooceraea biroi is especially well-suited for investigating the neuronal and genetic underpinnings of these behaviors.5 Unlike most ant species, O. biroi lacks a queen caste. Instead, colonies consist entirely of workers that reproduce in synchrony via parthenogenesis, giving rise to age-matched cohorts of clonally identical offspring.6,7 This unique life history enables precise experimental control over age, genotype, and colony composition. These features have also facilitated the introduction of genetically encoded calcium indicators into O. biroi, enabling in vivo two-photon imaging to investigate the neural basis of social behaviors.8 Despite its promise as a neuroscience model, the structure of the clonal raider ant brain has not been systematically characterized, and a representative reference brain does not exist. To address this gap, we imaged the brains of 40 age-matched, genetically identical individuals with confocal microscopy and, using 3D groupwise registration, generated the first reference brain. We introduce a registration pipeline to align brains to this reference, facilitating the comparison of anatomical features across labeling experiments with high spatial precision. Unexpectedly, we discovered extensive interindividual variability across our collection of brain samples. This raises the possibility that the behavioral division of labor in O. biroi is linked to individual differences in brain structure. This work provides a powerful resource for the social insect neuroscience community and reveals novel features of clonal raider ant neurobiology that may influence social behaviors and colony function.",

  "The reproductive division of labor defines eusocial insects like ants, where queens reproduce and workers remain sterile. Yet, some workers retain rudimentary ovaries, raising questions about latent reproductive potential. We examined morphological and transcriptomic differences in Pogonomyrmex barbatus queen and worker ovaries at different maturation stages and social contexts. Queens had large, yolk-rich oocytes, while worker ovaries showed regression. Callow workers (<5 days) had more developed ovaries than mature ones (>20 days), suggesting age-related regression, even without reproduction. Queenless workers exhibited greater ovarian regression than queenright ones, indicating factors beyond queen presence may limit reproductive activation. We found ~2000 caste-specific differentially expressed genes, including those involved in metabolism, hormonal signaling, and epigenetic regulation. Queenless workers upregulated a fertility-linked gene and downregulated lipid metabolism genes. Our results show that age and social environment influence ovarian state, highlighting complex regulation of reproductive suppression and offering insight into reproductive senescence in eusocial systems.",
  "South American species of seed-harvester ants in the genus Pogonomyrmex are interesting biologically because of their numerous queen phenotypes and life histories. This paper describes Pogonomyrmex eremicus n. sp., which belongs to the P. brevibarbis group. Pogonomyrmex eremicus is the first described species in the P. brevibarbis group to have ergatoid queens, and it also has intercastes with ergatoid queens, as opposed to alate queens. These intercastes all have similar morphology and none are intermediate to workers and ergatoid queens in sizerather they completely overlap with workers for four morphological measures (head width, head length, mesosoma length, pronotum width). Both ergatoid queens and intercastes are novel phenotypes that are assessed for fit to two prominent caste determination modelsthe standard and hourglass models. Both castes better fit the standard model of caste determination. Lastly, P. eremicus appears to be a narrow endemic that is restricted to a localized area of the Uspallata-Calingasta Valley that lies between the Precordillera and Andean Cordillera of Mendoza Province, Argentina.",
  "Within the same species of eusocial insects, individuals of different castes typically display widely different life-history traits: sterile workers live for a few months, while queens can live for decades. Ageing theories emphasise the importance of metabolism and oxidative stress in explaining longevity, with mitochondrial bioenergetics standing at the crossroads of energy and reactive oxygen species production. The study of mitochondrial functioning is therefore of great relevance in determining the nature of the mechanisms that explain the contrasting longevities between insect social castes. We addressed this question in the eusocial black garden ant Lasius niger. Our findings reveal that caste differences in mitochondrial bioenergetics and the oxidative balance only partially align with oxidative stress theory predictions. Long-lived queens display lower metabolic rates and mitochondrial density, yet maintain higher cellular energy availability, as reflected by a high adenylate energy charge (AEC). This may result from enhanced mitochondrial maintenance processes and potentially a specific recourse to the purine salvage pathway, promoting ATP availability while limiting oxidative cost. Our study highlights so far unrevealed bioenergetic adaptations that might contribute to the queens' remarkable lifespan.",
  "The genus Monomorium is an important phylogenetic group, notable for its taxonomic complexity and the presence of several well-known tramp species. In this study, we present a description of M. brachypterum sp. nov. from southern Japan along with an updated key to the Japanese species of the genus based on the worker caste. Molecular phylogenetic analysis using 13 protein-coding genes of the mitochondrial genome indicated that this new species is most closely related to M. intrudens. Within their overlapping distributions, analyses based on partial sequences of the mitochondrial COI gene showed that the two species are phylogenetically distinct. The queens of M. brachypterum are distinguished from those of M. intrudens by degenerated wings, suggesting contrasting dispersal strategies between the two sister species. In addition, a phylogenetic analysis performed for the Japanese Monomorium species provides support for the repeated evolution of diverse reproductive systems within this genus. The present study highlights a wide variety of evolutionary trends in the nest-level reproductive system, even among closely related species.",
  "Social insect colonies are known to be targeted by a wide variety of different parasites and pathogens because of the dense cohabitation of many highly related individuals. However, within a colony, the level of risk of exposure could vary among different groups depending on their social role. Unlike many parasites, which mostly affect specific groups of individuals, e.g. foragers, the myrmecoparasitic fungus Rickia wasmannii infects entire ant colonies, causing subtle changes in physiology, morphology and behaviour. We investigated how different groups within a colony respond to fungal infection by measuring the expression of the genes defensin 1 and prophenoloxidase, both vital components of ant immunity. We found that workers, queens and larvae varied considerably in defensin levels, though not in prophenoloxidase expression. In same-age workers, both prophenoloxidase and defensin 1 levels exhibited increases in correlation with parasite loads. In queens, only the body size appeared to influence immune gene expression, with larger individuals exhibiting higher levels of defensin 1. However, in workers, morphological and physiological traits did not correlate with gene expression. Larvae did not show any discernible response in immune gene expression, reflecting that they are typically not infected by the fungus. Our study reveals considerable variation in the immune response among different groups within ant colonies. These diverging reactions likely stem from differences in exposure to parasites, as well as differences in immunocompetence.",
  "Understanding how a single genome creates distinct phenotypes remains a fundamental challenge for biologists. Social insects provide a striking example of polyphenism, with queen and worker castes exhibiting morphological, behavioral, and reproductive differences. Here, we show that trophic eggs, which do not contain an embryo and are primarily regarded as a source of food, play a role in the process of caste determination in the harvester ant Pogonomyrmex rugosus. When first instar larvae were given access to trophic eggs, they mostly developed into workers. By contrast, larvae without access to trophic eggs developed into queens. We found that trophic eggs differ in many ways from viable eggs, including texture, morphology, and their contents of protein, triglycerides, glycogen, sugar, and small RNAs. Moreover, comparison of miRNA fragment size distributions suggests differences in the composition of miRNAs between the two egg types. This is the first demonstration of trophic eggs playing a role in caste determination in social insects.",
  "Reproductive division of labor is one of the most prominent features of social insects. Yet, the neural mechanisms that govern this division and the associated behavioral differentiation among castes remain obscure. In this study, we systematically characterized the anatomical features of dopamine neurons in the brain of Monomorium pharaonis and compared the cell number and spatial distribution of these neurons across castes. We identified 17 anatomically distinct clusters of dopamine neurons in the ant brain, with cell numbers varying from ∼322 to ∼431 across castes. The major dopamine clusters are located in brain regions analogous to those in flies, with 2 clusters, PAL and PPL1 exhibiting significantly higher cell numbers in ants than in flies. Notably, 4 clusters, DAM, D1, DPL, and PPL2, showed remarkable variation in cell numbers across castes. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we identified specific molecular markers for subdividing dopamine neurons. We validated the expression of multiple neuropeptide genes in specific dopamine clusters. In particular, we found that PPL2 cluster can be further divided into 2 subclusters, PPL2a and PPL2b, which are partially labeled by the peptide gene Nplp1. PPL2b neurons, characterized by larger cell bodies, and present only in unmated queens and males, are absent in mature queens and workers. These neurons are located adjacent to Nlg2-expressing lobular neurons, which are also absent in workers and may play a role in regulating mating behaviors. Our findings provide a foundation for further investigation into the neural mechanism underlying division of labor and caste-specific behaviors in ant.",
  "An arboreal ant species by nature, the Asian weaver ant Oecophylla smaragdina F., (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) colony's social structure composition was investigated in depth. Brood and barrack nests were collected from the African oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) canopies and Limau kasturi (Citrus microcarpa) orchards, and dissected. All caste's morphological traits were examined stereo-microscopically. The workers' width and length measurements of the separately dissected head, thorax, frontal view, abdomen, and body full side view sizes were recorded. All colonies comprise a founding queen laying thousands of eggs stored in a protective yellowish, unknown sticky substance (shining reflection), with reproductive winged green and newly emerged yellow queens, adult drone males, and wingless workers along their immature pupae and larvae arranged in woven, solid silken chambers (brood nests exclusively). Besides the traditionally known caste of minor and major workers, five polymorphic individuals comprising two unidentified novel sub-castes of intermediate workers and one sub-caste of major workers were described. The full body and abdomen lengths are proposed as dominant predicting factors differentiating among the five sub-castes. The discovery of a multimodal size frequency distribution model contrasts with the classical archetypical bimodal systems in ants. Intermediate workers foraging outside the nest revealed reconnaissance autonomy and aggressive behaviors that aided larger workers in securing the territorial perimeter. Bigger workers occupied the first defensive layers of the colony's territorial frontier, while the intermediate workers maintained their stance at a closer nest distance. Major workers systematically acted as leaders-supervisors by removing individuals of smaller size during overheating exposure. Due to their short lifespan and segregated nests, it is difficult to collect adult males in wide plantations. A stable and average mature three-year-old colony produces several reproductive individuals monthly. The mean number of emerging queens is higher in older colonies (scarcity of males) and lower for younger colonies (queens-males averages are correlated). The queen production increases with higher rainfall and relative humidity. This study identified three novel worker sub-castes: one major intermediate, two intermediate in size. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the overall worker's functional activity. The Asian weaver ant demonstrates adaptive measures in response to challenging abiotic factors (temperature), defying classical labor division rules.",
  "Ants originated over 150 million years ago through an irreversible transition to superorganismal colony life. Comparative analyses of 163 ant genomes, including newly generated whole-genome sequences of 145 ant species, reveal extensive genome rearrangements correlated with speciation rates. Meanwhile, conserved syntenic blocks are enriched with co-expressed genes involved in basal metabolism and caste differentiation. Gene families related to digestion, endocrine signaling, cuticular hydrocarbon synthesis, and chemoreception expanded in the ant ancestor, while many caste-associated genes underwent positive selection in the formicoid ancestor. Elaborations and reductions of queen-worker dimorphism and other social traits left convergent signatures of intensified or relaxed selection in conserved signaling and metabolic pathways, suggesting that a core gene set was used to diversify organizational complexity. Previously uncharacterized genetic regulators of caste development were confirmed by functional experiments. This study reconstructs the genetic underpinning of social traits and their integration within gene-regulatory networks shaping caste phenotypes.",
  "Termites are social cockroaches that evolved eusociality independently from social Hymenoptera (ants, bees, and wasps). Thus, they are diploid organisms, and this has consequences for the occurrence of conflict in termites. Here, I outline the potential for conflict in termites and summarise studies that tested its actual occurrence. In termites, conflicts over the sex ratio, which are typical for haplodiploid social Hymenoptera, are generally absent. All else equal, in monogamous termite colonies, no genetic conflict exists over one's own reproduction versus helping to raise siblings. Potential for conflict in termites mainly arises due to two main causes: nonmonogamy of colonies and options for colony inheritance by workers. Nonmonogamy occurs when colonies are founded by more than one pair of reproductives (mainly in the species-rich Termitidae with largely sterile workers) or due to fusion of neighbouring colonies (mainly in wood-dwelling termites with totipotent workers). Nonmonogamy of colonies could favour kin-discriminatory behaviour, but, like in social Hymenoptera, evidence for nepotism is rare. Conflict over inheritance of the natal breeding position commonly arises in species with nonsterile workers, which develop into (neotenic) replacement reproductives and inbreed when their king or queen dies. Conflict over inheritance seems to be widespread, yet conflict resolution mechanisms may have evolved, which might include the evolution of worker sterility. Generally, few experimental data exist for termites; more research is required for firm conclusions. Such studies should consider the strong interaction between workers' reproductive potential (which varies from totipotent to sterile), power to control their own caste fate, and ecology.",
  "P450 enzymes are integral to insect physiology, metabolism, hormone regulation, and adaptation to environmental challenges. By leveraging transcriptomic and genomic data, this study characterized the expression of 68 unique P450 genes across developmental stages and castes in the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta), uncovering stage- and caste-specific differential expression patterns. Genes from the CYP4, CYP6, and CYP9 families, known for metabolizing exogenous and endogenous compounds, were highly expressed in early larval stages and minim workers, underscoring their roles in supporting rapid growth, hormone metabolism, colony maintenance, and brood care. The overexpression of CYP4AA1-linked to pheromone production-in queens, female alates, and female alate pupae highlights its critical functions in reproductive dominance, social structure maintenance, and colony dynamics. Here, juvenile hormone biosynthesis genes, including CYP305A1 and CYP315A1, exhibited significant overexpression in later instar larvae and larger workers, emphasizing their roles in development and in fulfilling colony-wide physiological demands. The \"Halloween genes\" (CYP302A1, CYP306A1, CYP315A1, CYP307A1, and CYP314A1) and CYP18A1 demonstrated dynamic regulation across developmental stages and castes, reflecting their essential contributions to hormonal production and balance throughout S. invicta's lifecycle. These findings offer valuable insights into the molecular and biological mechanisms driving S. invicta's social organization, developmental transitions, physiological adaptations, and evolutionary success. They also provide a foundation for future research into the regulatory pathways governing P450 gene expression and function.",
  "The relationship between hosts and viruses is influenced by various factors. One potential factor is sociality. In social organisms such as ants, the interaction between hosts and viruses might differ from those of solitary organisms due to their unique ecology. We previously isolated a double-stranded RNA toti-like virus, Camponotus yamaokai virus (CYV), from the arboreal ant Camponotus yamaokai. The ant exhibits a polygynous colony structure with multiple queens and within-nest mating behaviors. Such unique ecological traits may have driven the evolution of a distinctive relationship with the virus. However, the biological characteristics of CYV have not been sufficiently studied. In this study, we investigated the biological characteristics of CYV through rearing experiments and field surveys. No horizontal transmission between workers and broods was detected, and there were no significant differences in prevalence between castes. CYV was detected at all seven locations surveyed, with prevalence ranging from 60-95%. The high CYV prevalence across the host's distribution range indicates that the geographical distribution of CYV aligns with that of its host. These results suggest that CYV has spread throughout the host population, primarily through vertical transmission.",
  "Globally, potentially hundreds of Nylanderia species remain undescribed, hidden within several broadly distributed complexes of morphologically cryptic species. By integrating phylogenomics, geography, and morphology, we describe eight new Nylanderia species from southern Mexico and Mesoamerica, increasing the total number of known species in the genus to 131. In the Americas, Nylanderia is divided into two distantly related clades: American Clade I (AC1) and American Clade II (AC2). Within AC1, Nylanderia austroccidua (Trager) was originally described as a widespread and morphologically variable species distributed from Utah to Costa Rica. This species was diagnosed by a slight concavity in the anterior face of the pronotum and varying degrees of fine cuticular microsculpturing across the body that causes blue cuticular iridescence under microscopic examination. Using Ultraconserved Elements (UCEs) for molecular phylogenetic analysis, we found that taxa matching the original description of N. austroccidua are paraphyletic with respect to Nearctic Nylanderia species. We also found that AC1 includes a Neotropical subclade extending into Mesoamerica, the distribution of which overlaps with AC2, which is exclusively Neotropical. Along with an updated description of N. austroccidua, we also describe the following new species belonging to clade AC1: N. breviscapa, sp. nov., N. contraria, sp. nov., N. lazulina, sp. nov., N. luceata, sp. nov., N. mendax sp. nov., N. mosaica sp. nov., N. polita sp. nov., and N. usul, sp. nov. A dichotomous key and images of the worker caste of these species are included and, where available, images of queens and males are provided.",
  "Building differences between genetically equivalent units is a fundamental challenge for all multicellular organisms and superorganisms. In ants, reproductive or worker fate is typically determined during the larval stage, through feeding regimes managed by adult caretakers. However, the feeding care provided to larvae varies significantly across ants, as does phenotypic divergence between queen and worker castes. Here, we employed comparative phylogenetic methods and causal inference to investigate the relationships between larval feeding care, caste size dimorphism, and social complexity across ant diversity. We digitized the life's work of George and Jeanette Wheeler, cataloging the larval morphology of over 700 species, and we compiled data on species diets and larval feeding behaviors from the literature and our own observations. We measured queen-worker size dimorphism in 392 species and gathered data for colony size, worker polymorphism, and worker reproduction. Our analyses revealed that ancestral active-feeding larvae evolved passive morphologies when adults began feeding them individually, typically with processed material and often following a shift to nonpredatory diets. Greater queen-worker size dimorphism coevolved with larval passiveness, alongside traits indicative of increased social complexity, including larger colony sizes, worker subcastes, and a reduction in workers' reproductive potential. Likelihood comparisons of causal phylogenetic models support that extended alloparental care facilitated stronger caste dimorphism, which, in turn and along with increased colony sizes, promoted higher social complexity. Our results suggest that enhanced adult control over larval development enabled greater phenotypic specialization within colonies, with profound implications for social evolution.",
  "In social animals, reproductive activity and ageing are influenced by group composition. In monogynous (single-queen) insect societies, queen presence affects worker fecundity and longevity, but less is known about worker responses to queen number variation in polygynous (multi-queen) species or how queens age in these systems. We created queenless, one-queen and two-queen colonies of the invasive, polygynous ant Tapinoma magnum to examine the effect of queen number on worker survival, ovary and oocyte development, oxidative stress resistance and fat body gene expression. We also compared the fecundity and brain and fat body transcriptomes between young and old queens. Queenless workers experienced the highest mortality, contrasting with monogynous species, where queen removal typically extends lifespan. Workers lived longer and had more developing oocytes in their ovaries in single-queen than in two-queen colonies. Queen number did not directly affect oxidative stress resistance or fat body gene expression, though its effect on the latter differed between inside and outside workers. Furthermore, inside-likely younger-workers produced more oocytes, showed higher oxidative stress resistance and upregulated antioxidant genes compared to outside-likely older-workers. Minimal shifts in fecundity and gene expression of differently aged queens indicated their physiological stability. Our research highlights distinct caste- and tissue-specific responses to varying queen numbers in workers of a highly polygynous species.",
  "Social insects form complex societies with division of labour between different female castes. In most species, a single queen heads the colony; in others, several queens share the task of reproduction. These different social organisations are often associated with distinct queen morphologies and life-history strategies and occur in different environments. In the ant Temnothorax rugatulus, queens are dimorphic. Macrogynes and microgynes reside in mono- and polygynous colonies and at lower and higher elevations, respectively. We analysed plastic changes in brain transcriptomes in response to the social environment in these queen morphs and their workers. We manipulated the number of queens over 4 months to investigate whether transcriptional activity is influenced by queen morph, social environment or their interaction. Changes in gene expression in the queens' brains in response to our manipulations were largely influenced by the interaction between social environment and queen morph, rather than independently by these factors. Macrogynes and microgynes thus adjust differently to their social environment. Similarly, worker transcriptomes were influenced by an interaction between behavioural type, that is, nurses or foragers, and queen morph. Nurses differentially regulated genes related to nutrition depending on queen morph, suggesting a link between social environment and metabolic dynamics in ant colonies. Overall, our study sheds light on how the social environment influences the molecular physiology of social insects. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in this ant with two queen morphs, worker physiology depends on queen morph and their role in the colony.",
  "Insect antennae play a crucial role in communication, acting as receptors for both chemical and physical cues. This sensory reception is facilitated by specialized cuticular structures known as sensilla, which exhibit diverse morphologies and functions. In ants, caste polymorphism and sexual dimorphism manifest in antennal structure. This study characterized and compared the antennal sensilla across different castes (major and minor workers, and queens) and sexes of the leaf-cutter ant Acromyrmex subterraneus subterraneus, an important agricultural pest, using scanning electron microscopy. The lengths of the scape and pedicel were greater in major workers and queens compared to other classes of individuals (i.e., minor workers and males). Sensillum numbers were significantly higher for these two female classes than for minor workers and tended to be higher than for males. In addition, various types of sensilla were identified, including chaetic types I, II, and III, trichoid I and II, basiconic, ampullaceous, and coeloconic. Chaetic sensilla were found to be the most abundant in all classes of individuals studied. Overall, similar types of sensilla were found in females (major, minor, queen) and males. The differences in the presence, absence, and number of antennal sensilla were analyzed in relation to their functional roles across the studied groups.",
  "Selfish genetic elements subvert the normal rules of inheritance to unfairly propagate themselves, often at the expense of other genomic elements and the fitness of individuals carrying them. Social life provides diverse avenues for the propagation of such elements. In the fire ant Solenopsis invicta, polymorphic social organization is controlled by a social chromosome, one variant of which (Sb) enhances its own transmission in polygyne colonies through effects on caste development and queen acceptance by workers. Whether the selfish effects of Sb extend to haploid (reproductive) males in this system is less clear. Here, we demonstrate a strong overrepresentation of the Sb social chromosome haplotype in reproductive males, relative to Mendelian expectations, in both the pupal and adult stages. We tested for the presence of selective execution of adult SB males by workers but did not detect such behavior. Combined with the presence of a strong imbalance in the haplotype frequencies already early in the pupal stage, these results indicate that the Sb supergene may distort male haplotype frequencies during larval or embryonic development. These findings are significant because they demonstrate yet another mode by which the selfish tendencies of the Sb supergene are manifested, illuminate complex interactions between Sb and the fire ant breeding system, inform the development of models of the population dynamics of Sb, and illustrate how a selfish supergene can increase in frequency in a population despite harboring deleterious mutations.",
  "Ants are one of the most ecologically and evolutionarily successful groups of animals and exhibit a remarkable degree of phenotypic diversity. This success is largely attributed to the fact that all ants are eusocial and live in colonies with a reproductive division of labor between morphologically distinct queen and worker castes. Yet, despite over a century of studies on caste determination and evolution in ants, we lack a complete ontogenetic series from egg to adult for any ant species. We, therefore, present a developmental table for the Pharaoh ant Monomorium pharaonis, a species whose colonies simultaneously produce reproductive queens and completely sterile workers. In total, M. pharaonis embryonic, larval, and pupal development lasts 45 days. During embryogenesis, the majority of developmental events are conserved between M. pharaonis and the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. We discovered, however, two types of same-stage embryos before gastrulation: (1) embryos with internalized germ cells; and (2) embryos with germ cells outside of the blastoderm at the posterior pole. Moreover, we also found two-types of embryos following germ band extension: (1) embryos with primordial germ cells that will develop into reproductive queens; and (2) embryos with no germ cells that will develop into completely sterile workers. Together, these data show that queen and worker castes are already determined and differentiated by early embryogenesis. During larval development, we confirmed that reproductive and worker larvae proceed through three larval instars. Using anatomical and developmental markers, we can further discern the development of gyne (unmated queen) larvae, male larvae, and worker larvae as early as the 1st instar. Overall, we hope that the ontogenetic series we present here will serve as a blueprint for the generation of future ant developmental tables.",
  "Caste differentiation involves many functional traits that diverge during larval growth and metamorphosis to produce adults irreversibly adapted to reproductive division of labor. Investigating developmental differentiation is important for general biological understanding and has increasingly been explored for social phenotypes that diverge in parallel from similar genotypes. Here, we use Monomorium pharaonis ants to investigate the extent to which canalized worker development can be shifted toward gyne (virgin-queen) phenotypes by juvenile hormone (JH) treatment. We show that excess JH can activate gyne-biased development in workers so that wing-buds, ocelli, antennal and genital imaginal discs, flight muscles, and gyne-like fat bodies and brains emerge after pupation. However, ovary development remained unresponsive to JH treatment, indicating that JH-sensitive germline sequestration happens well before somatic differentiation. Our findings reveal important qualitative restrictions in the extent to which JH treatment can redirect larval development and that these constraints are independent of body size. Our findings corroborate that JH is a key hormone for inducing caste differentiation but show that this process can be asymmetric for higher colony-level germline versus somatic caste differentiation in superorganisms as defined a century ago by Wheeler. We quantified gene expression changes in response to JH treatment throughout development and identified a set of JH-sensitive genes responsible for the emergence of gyne-like somatic traits. Our study suggests that the gonadotropic role of JH in ovary maturation has shifted from the individual level in solitary insects to the colony level in an evolutionary-derived and highly polygynous superorganism like the pharaoh ant.",
  "The size-complexity hypothesis is a leading explanation for the evolution of complex life on earth. It predicts that in lineages that have undergone a major transition in organismality, larger numbers of lower-level subunits select for increased division of labour. Current data from multicellular organisms and social insects support a positive correlation between the number of cells and number of cell types and between colony size and the number of castes. However, the implication of these results is unclear, because colony size and number of cells are correlated with other variables which may also influence selection for division of labour, and causality could be in either direction. Here, to resolve this problem, we tested multiple causal hypotheses using data from 794 ant species. We found that larger colony sizes favoured the evolution of increased division of labour, resulting in more worker castes and greater variation in worker size. By contrast, our results did not provide consistent support for alternative hypotheses regarding either queen mating frequency or number of queens per colony explaining variation in division of labour. Overall, our results provide strong support for the size-complexity hypothesis.",
  "Respirometry provides a direct measure of an organism's O2 consumption rate (VO2), which is a significant component of its metabolic rate (energy expenditure). Amongst ants, variations in lifespan between different social castes (such as workers and queens) can be substantial, varying depending on the species. As metabolic rate is higher in short-living species, we aimed to determine how VO2 and longevity may have coevolved within ant casts. Measuring VO2 in such tiny animal models can be challenging, and as a first methodological step, we validate the use of a Clark electrode, initially designed for measuring mitochondrial respiration control pathways, for assessing VO2 in ants within a sealed chamber. This was done by comparing it with stop-flow VO2 and CO2 production, using a traditional indirect calorimetry device. The global aim is to provide a reliable protocol to conduct accurate comparisons of metabolic rates within and among ant species. As expected, using the Clark electrode entails high time resolution and revealed that queens and workers exhibited discontinuous gas exchange, with episodes of apnea lasting up to 20 min.",
  "Wolbachia is a widespread maternally transmitted endosymbiotic bacteria with diverse phenotypic effects on its insect hosts, ranging from parasitic to mutualistic. Wolbachia commonly infects social insects, where it faces unique challenges associated with its host's caste-based reproductive division of labor and colony living. Here, we dissect the benefits and costs of Wolbachia infection on life-history traits of the invasive pharaoh ant, Monomorium pharaonis, which are relatively short lived and show natural variation in Wolbachia infection status between colonies. We quantified the effects of Wolbachia infection on the lifespan of queen and worker castes, the egg-laying rate of queens across queen lifespan, and the metabolic rates of whole colonies and colony members. Infected queens laid more eggs than uninfected queens but had similar metabolic rates and lifespans. Interestingly, infected workers outlived uninfected workers. At the colony level, infected colonies were more productive as a consequence of increased queen egg-laying rates and worker longevity, and infected colonies had higher metabolic rates during peak colony productivity. While some effects of infection, such as elevated colony-level metabolic rates, may be detrimental in more stressful natural conditions, we did not find any costs of infection under relatively benign laboratory conditions. Overall, our study emphasizes that Wolbachia infection can have beneficial effects on ant colony growth and worker survival in at least some environments.",
  "The clonal raider ant, Ooceraeabiroi, is a queenless species that reproduces asexually, and these traits make it an attractive model system for laboratory research. However, it is unclear where on the ant phylogeny these traits evolved, partly because few closely related species have been described and studied. Here, we describe a new raider ant species, Ooceraeahainingensis sp. nov., from Zhejiang, China. This species is closely related to O.biroi but can be distinguished by the following features: 1) workers of O.hainingensis sp. nov. have an obvious promesonotal suture and a metanotal groove, whereas these characters are ambiguous in O.biroi; and 2) the subpetiolar process of O.hainingensis is prominent and anteroventrally directed like a thumb with sublinear posteroventral margin, while in O.biroi, it is anteroventrally directed but slightly backward-bent. Molecular phylogenetic analyses confirm that O.hainingensis is genetically distinct from O.biroi. Importantly, unlike O.biroi, O.hainingensis has a queen caste with wings and well-developed eyes. This suggests that the loss of the queen caste and transition to asexual reproduction by workers is specific to O.biroi and occurred after that species diverged from closely related congeneric species.",
  "Juvenile hormone is considered to be a master regulator of polyphenism in social insects. In the ant Cardiocondyla obscurior, whether a female egg develops into a queen or a worker is determined maternally and caste-specific differentiation occurs in embryos, so that queens and workers can be distinguished in a non-invasive manner from late embryogenesis onwards. This ant also exhibits two male morphs - winged and wingless males. Here, we used topical treatment with juvenile hormone III and its synthetic analogue methoprene, a method that influences caste determination and differentiation in some ant species, to investigate whether hormone manipulation affects the development and growth of male, queen- and worker-destined embryos and larvae. We found no effect of hormone treatment on female caste ratios or body sizes in any of the treated stages, even though individuals reacted to heightened hormone availability with increased expression of krüppel-homolog 1, a conserved JH first-response gene. In contrast, hormone treatment resulted in the emergence of significantly larger males, although male morph fate was not affected. These results show that in C. obscurior, maternal caste determination leads to irreversible and highly canalized caste-specific development and growth.",
  "Ant colonies are organized in castes with distinct behaviors that together allow the colony to strive. Reproduction relies on one or a few queens that stay in the nest producing eggs, while females of the worker caste do not reproduce and instead engage in colony maintenance and brood caretaking. Yet, in spite of this clear separation of functions, workers can become reproductive under defined circumstances. Here, we review the context in which workers become reproductive, exhibiting asexual or sexual reproduction depending on the species. Remarkably, the activation of reproduction in these workers can be quite stable, with changes that include behavior and a dramatic extension of lifespan. We compare these changes between species that do or do not have a queen caste. We discuss how the mechanisms underlying reproductive plasticity include changes in hormonal functions and in epigenetic configurations. Further studies are warranted to elucidate not only how reproductive functions have been gradually restricted to the queen caste during evolution but also how reproductive plasticity remains possible in workers of some species.",
  "Solenopsis invicta virus 3 (SINV-3) has been shown to cause significant mortality among all stages of its host, Solenopsis invicta. One impact of the virus is alteration of worker ant foraging behavior, which results in colony starvation and collapse over time. Additionally, it has been hypothesized that SINV-3 infection of S. invicta may disrupt worker ant brood care behavior. To investigate this possibility, various combinations of SINV-3-infected and -uninfected adult (worker) and immature (brood) stages were placed together and monitored using the response variables, mortality, egg hatch, and virus load. While significant differences in percent cumulative S. invicta worker ant mortality among six combinations of SINV-3-infected and -uninfected stages were observed, no significant differences in percent cumulative mortality of S. invicta larvae or pupae were observed. No significant differences in egg hatch were observed among SINV-3-uninfected, SINV-3-infected (colony-treated and queen-treated), and starved colonies. Eggs hatched normally in 10-12 days for all treatments indicating that egg care by worker ants was unaffected by SINV-3 infection status. The study further clarifies SINV-3 pathogenesis in its host, S. invicta. Larval mortality in SINV-3-infected colonies does not appear to be caused by worker ant neglect. S. invicta brood under the care of SINV-3-infected worker ants did not exhibit higher mortality rates compared with those tended by SINV-3-uninfected worker ants.",
  "Juvenile hormone (JH) acts in the regulation of caste differentiation between queens and workers (i.e., with or without reproductive capacity) during vitellin synthesis and oogenesis in social insects. However, the regulatory mechanisms have not yet been elucidated. Here, we identified a highly expressed microRNA (miRNA), miR-1175-3p, in the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta. We found that miR-1175-3p is prominently present in the fat bodies and ovaries of workers. Furthermore, miR-1175-3p interacts with its target gene, broad-complex core (Br-C), in the fat bodies. By utilizing miR-1175-3p agomir, we successfully suppressed the expression of the Br-C protein in queens, resulting in reduced vitellogenin expression, fewer eggs, and poorly developed ovaries. Conversely, decreasing miR-1175-3p levels led to the increased expression of Br-C and vitellogenin in workers, triggering the \"re-development\" of the ovaries. Moreover, when queens were fed with JH, the expression of miR-1175-3p decreased, whereas the expression of vitellogenin-2 and vitellogenin-3 increased. Notably, the suppression of fertility in queens caused by treatment with agomir miR-1175-3p was completely rescued by the increased vitellogenin expression induced by being fed with JH. These results suggest the critical role of miR-1175-3p in JH-regulated reproduction, shedding light on the molecular mechanism underlying miRNA-mediated fecundity in social insects and providing a novel strategy for managing S. invicta.",
  "The mandibular gland is an important exocrine gland connected to the mandibles. In ants, it plays a crucial role in alarm communication and reproduction. While the overall morphology of the mandibular gland does not vary much between ant species, significant differences exist in the ultrastructural characteristics and gland size in some reported cases. However, there have been few systematic comparative studies on this subject. In this paper, we conducted microscopic observations to analyze the morphological and ultrastructural similarities and differences of the mandibular gland in different castes of Camponotus japonicus. Our findings revealed that the mandibular glands of males were significantly larger than those of females. In terms of relative size, within the female castes the mandibular glands of minor workers were the largest. Additionally, our observations of the ultrastructure showed that secretory substances were most abundant in queens. All female castes and males showed the presence of crystalline structures in the secretory cells. The content of these biocrystals decreased from minor workers to major workers, queens, and males. In males, however, crystalline structures were rare and the most abundant substances are droplet-like secretions. The differences in morphology and ultrastructure between different castes suggest that the function of the mandibular gland varies among castes. In conclusion, our study provides insights into the morphological and ultrastructural characteristics of the mandibular gland in different castes of C. japonicus. Further research is needed to fully understand the specific functions and mechanisms of this gland in ants.",
  "Social insects are models for studies of phenotypic plasticity. Ant queens and workers vary in fecundity and lifespan, which are enhanced and extended in queens. Yet, the regulatory mechanisms underlying this variation are not well understood. Ant queens live and reproduce for years, so that they need to protect their germline from transposable element (TE) activity, which may be redundant in short-lived, often sterile workers. We analysed the expression of two protective classes of small RNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs) and Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), in various tissues, castes and age classes of the ant Temnothorax rugatulus. In queens, piRNAs were highly abundant in ovaries with TEs being their clear targets, with reduced but still detectable piRNA-specific ping-pong signatures in thorax and brains. piRNA pathway activity varied little with age in queens. Moreover, the reduced ovaries of workers also exhibited similar piRNA activity and this not only in young, fertile workers, but also in older foragers with regressed ovaries. Therefore, these ants protect their germline through piRNA activity, regardless of ovarian development, age or caste, even in sterile workers often considered the soma of the superorganism. Our tissue-specific miRNA analysis detected the expression of 304 miRNAs, of which 105 were expressed in all tissues, 10 enriched in the brain, three in the thorax, whereas 83 were ovarian-specific. We identified ovarian miRNAs whose expression was related to caste, fecundity and age, and which likely regulate group-specific gene expression. sRNA shifts in young- to middle-aged queens were minor, suggesting delayed senescence in this reproductive caste.",
  "The emergence of caste-differentiated colonies, which have been defined as 'superorganisms', in ants, bees, and wasps represents a major transition in evolution. Lifetime mating commitment by queens, pre-imaginal caste determination and lifetime unmatedness of workers are key features of these animal societies. Workers in superorganismal species like honey bees and many ants have consequently lost, or retain only vestigial spermathecal structures. However, bumble bee workers retain complete spermathecae despite 25-40 million years since their origin of superorganismality, which remains an evolutionary mystery. Here, we show (i) that bumble bee workers retain queen-like reproductive traits, being able to mate and produce colonies, underlain by queen-like gene expression, (ii) the social conditions required for worker mating, and (iii) that these abilities may be selected for by early queen-loss in these annual species. These results challenge the idea of lifetime worker unmatedness in superorganisms, and provide an exciting new tool for the conservation of endangered bumble bee species.",
  "Hemocytes are cells present in the hemolymph of insects that play a role in combating invasive pathogens, ensuring defense by the immune system in these organisms. While the types of hemocytes are well known in some insect representatives, data on these cells in Hymenoptera are limited to certain bees and wasps, with little information available for ants. Among ants, the genus Atta has environmental and economic importance, forming highly organized colonies consisting of the queen and workers, with the latter subdivided into subcastes: gardeners, waste removers, foragers, and soldiers, which are exposed to different pathogens. This study describes the morphology of hemocytes in the worker subcastes of Atta sexdens rubropilosa. Hemolymph samples from the ant were submitted to light, confocal, and scanning electron microscopy analyses. Five types of hemocytes were identified in the hemolymph of all ant subcastes, including prohemocytes, oenocytoids, spherulocytes, plasmatocytes, and granulocytes. They exhibited nuclei with a predominance of decondensed chromatin. The granulocytes were the most abundant cell type in the subcastes, followed by prohemocytes, plasmatocytes, oenocytoids, and spherulocytes. Phagocytosis assays reveal that plasmatocytes and granulocytes are the main phagocytic cells in all castes evaluated. This study fills an important gap in understanding the immune response in this ant species.",
  "The subgenus Campomyrma Wheeler, 1911 of the genus Polyrhachis Smith, 1758 in Thailand and Laos is reviewed. Four species are recognized, of which two are described and illustrated as new to science based on the worker and dealate queen under the names Polyrhachis quadrispinosa Jaitrong & Noon-anant, sp. nov. (found in a dead twig on a rubber tree) and P. lao Jaitrong & Yamane, sp. nov. (collected in dead wood). Polyrhachis sukarmani Kohout, 2007 is recorded for the first time from Thailand. A key to the Thai and Lao species of the subgenus based on the worker caste is given.",
  "The Dufour's and venom glands are the most developed glands connected to the female reproductive organs, playing important roles in defense, foraging, information exchange, and reproduction in ants. The main chemical secretions of these glands vary among species and even among castes of the same species. In this study, we analyzed the chemical components of the Dufour's and venom glands in different castes of Camponotus japonicus (original worker, minor worker, major worker, gyne, and queen) using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) with two sample processing methods (hexane solution and solid-phase microextraction). The secretion of the Dufour's gland is characterized by a high ratio of alkanes, with n-undecane being the dominant secretion in all castes except the original workers. The venom gland's secretion mainly includes alkanes, acids, ketones, and alcohols, with formic acid and n-undecane being the dominant components. Additionally, the chemical composition and proportion of the main components vary significantly among castes, which may be closely related to the division of labor in their social life. This study provides basic information to further understand the function of these two glands in the social life of ants.",
  "The ability to share and store food is paramount in group-living animals, allowing a finely tuned distribution of resources over time and individuals and an enhanced survival over periods of food scarcity. Ants have several ways to store food: one of them is their gastral crop, also known as a \"social stomach.\" Nutrients in the crop can be regurgitated to nestmates through oral trophallaxis (mouth-to-mouth) or proceed to the midgut by opening the proventriculus, a valve connecting the crop to the midgut. However, some ants are also known to have a so-called \"thoracic crop,\" an extension of the esophagus that allows for additional storage space. In this study, we provide the first evidence of a thoracic crop in the genus Carebara, in reproductive (queen) and sterile (soldier and worker) castes. We discuss how the ant body plan allowed for the evolution of a novel food storage structure in the mesothorax.",
  "There are only two Aphaenogaster species from the subterranea group in the western Mediterranean: A.ichnusa Santschi, 1925, from south-western Europe, and A.subterranea (Latreille, 1798), also occurring in central and eastern Europe. Historically, the two species have been widely misunderstood: A.ichnusa was long considered a Sardinian endemic subspecies of A.subterranea, while its continental populations were misidentified as A.subterranea s. str. Recently, A.ichnusa was elevated to species rank and its worker caste was redescribed with that of A.subterranea, allowing for their correct identification. Yet their distribution was documented in detail only for France and Sardinia. Furthermore, no morphological characters were described to distinguish the males and queens of the two species. By investigating private and museum collections, 276 new records of A.ichnusa are provided here and 154 of A.subterranea from the western Mediterranean. Additionally, qualitative and quantitative morphological characters were combined to identify their males and queens. We present the new southernmost, easternmost, and westernmost distribution limits for A.ichnusa. Based on our results, this species is widely distributed in Italy and Catalonia (Spain), also occurring on several Mediterranean islands, avoiding areas with continental climate and high altitudes. Sicily is the only island to host the less thermophilous A.subterranea, which otherwise extends westward to Galicia (Spain). Sympatric occurrence is not rare along the contact zone. Additional natural history observations are reported regarding foraging habits, associated myrmecophiles, habitat preferences, and colony structure in the two species.",
  "The metapleural gland is a unique feature of the ant phenotype, but diversity in its anatomy and function across the ants is not well documented or understood. We studied the morphology of the metapleural gland in 20 mainly Oriental Strumigenys species using histology, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, and micro-CT. The gland is formed by a cluster of class-3 cells, their secretion is transported through a bundle of ducts into the sclerotized atrium and is guided along a series of parallel cuticular ridges towards the atrial opening. Among the examined species, queens have more gland cells than conspecific workers, while the examined males do not have the gland. The social parasite S. mutica has the most developed metapleural gland. In addition, we describe a novel class-1 atrial cone gland which is associated with the metapleural gland. The epithelium of this cone gland forms an invagination into the ventral atrium of the metapleural gland. The cuticular cone may be lacking in some Afrotropical and Neotropical species, although these may still contain the epithelial gland. The functional and evolutionary drivers of morphological variation in the exocrine system across species form interesting questions for future work.",
  "The Polyrhachis (Myrmatopa) flavicornis species group in Thailand is reviewed. Four species are recognized, of which one species closely related to Polyrhachis constructor Smith, 1857 is described and illustrated as new to science based on the worker caste under the name Polyrhachis longipilosa sp. nov. The queens of P. flavicornis Smith, 1857 and P. constructor, and the males of P. flavicornis and P. varicolor Viehmeyer, 1916 are described. The new species is distributed in western Thailand in the area north of the Isthmus of Kra, while P. constructor is distributed in Malaysia (West Malaysia and Sabah), Indonesia, Singapore, southern and western Thailand. Polyrhachis piliventris Smith, 1857 and Polyrhachis elii Emery, 1900 are synonymized with P. constructor. A key to the Thai species of the Polyrhachis flavicornis species group is given. The type series of P. longipilosa was collected from the canopy of a dry evergreen forest.",
  "Social insects demonstrate adaptive behaviour for a given colony size. Remarkably, most species do this even without visual information in a dark environment. However, how they achieve this is yet unknown. Based on individual trait expression, an agent-based simulation was used to identify an explicit mechanism for understanding colony size dependent behaviour. Through repeated physical contact between the queen and individual workers, individual colony members monitor the physiological states of others, reflecting such contact information in their physiology and behaviour. Feedback between the sensing of physiological states and the corresponding behaviour patterns leads to self-organisation with colonies shifting according to their size. We showed (1) the queen can exhibit adaptive behaviour patterns for the increase in colony size while density per space remains unchanged, and (2) such physical constraints can underlie the adaptive switching of colony stages from successful patrol behaviour to unsuccessful patrol behaviour, which leads to constant ovary development (production of reproductive castes). The feedback loops embedded in the queen between the perception of internal states of the workers and behavioural patterns can explain the adaptive behaviour as a function of colony size.",
  "Solenopsis invicta is an invasive ant introduced into the United States in the early 1900s. Control efforts and damage caused by this ant exceed $8 billion annually. Solenopsis invicta virus 3 (SINV-3) is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus (Solinviviridae) that is being used as a classical natural control agent for S. invicta. S. invicta colonies were exposed to purified preparations of SINV-3 to investigate the impact of the virus on the ant. Food retrieval behavior (i.e., foraging) by worker ants was significantly decreased, which led to mortality among all life stages. Queen fecundity and weight were also significantly decreased. The change in food retrieval was associated with the exhibition of an unusual behavior, whereby the remaining live ant workers wedged dead ant worker corpses into and on top of cricket carcasses (the laboratory colony food source). SINV-3 infection alters foraging behavior in S. invicta, which adversely impacts colony nutrition.",
  "Most ant species have two distinct female castes-queens and workers-yet the developmental and genetic mechanisms that produce these alternative phenotypes remain poorly understood. Working with a clonal ant, we discovered a variant strain that expresses queen-like traits in individuals that would normally become workers. The variants show changes in morphology, behavior, and fitness that cause them to rely on workers in wild-type (WT) colonies for survival. Overall, they resemble the queens of many obligately parasitic ants that have evolutionarily lost the worker caste and live inside colonies of closely related hosts. The prevailing theory for the evolution of these workerless social parasites is that they evolve from reproductively isolated populations of facultative intermediates that acquire parasitic phenotypes in a stepwise fashion. However, empirical evidence for such facultative ancestors remains weak, and it is unclear how reproductive isolation could gradually arise in sympatry. In contrast, we isolated these variants just a few generations after they arose within their WT parent colony, implying that the complex phenotype reported here was induced in a single genetic step. This suggests that a single genetic module can decouple the coordinated mechanisms of caste development, allowing an obligately parasitic variant to arise directly from a free-living ancestor. Consistent with this hypothesis, the variants have lost one of the two alleles of a putative supergene that is heterozygous in WTs. These findings provide a plausible explanation for the evolution of ant social parasites and implicate new candidate molecular mechanisms for ant caste differentiation.",
  "Ant societies are primarily composed of females, whereby labor is divided into reproductive, or queen, and non-reproductive, or worker, castes. Workers and reproductive queens can differ greatly in behavior, longevity, physiology, and morphology, but queen-worker differences are usually modest relative to the differences in males. Males are short-lived, typically do not provide the colony with labor, often look like a different species, and only occur seasonally. It is these differences that have historically led to their neglect in social insect research, but also why they may facilitate novel phenotypic variation - by increasing the phenotypic variability that is available for selection. In this study, worker variation in multivariate size-shape space paralleled male-queen variation. As worker variation increased within species, so did sexual variation. Across species in two independent genera, using head width as a proxy for body size, sexual size dimorphism correlated with worker polymorphism regardless of whether the ancestral condition was large or small worker/sexual dimorphism. Mounting molecular data support the hypothesis that queen-worker caste determination has co-opted many genes/pathways from sex determination. The molecular evidence, coupled with the observations from this study, leads to the hypothesis that sexual selection and selection on colony-level traits are non-independent, and that sexual dimorphism may even have facilitated the evolution of the distinct worker caste.",
  "Social insect queens and workers can engage in conflict over reproductive allocation when they have different fitness optima. Here, we show that queens have control over queen-worker caste allocation in the ant Cardiocondyla obscurior, a species in which workers lack reproductive organs. We describe crystalline deposits that distinguish castes from the egg stage onwards, providing the first report of a discrete trait that can be used to identify ant caste throughout pre-imaginal development. The comparison of queen and worker-destined eggs and larvae revealed size and weight differences in late development, but no discernible differences in traits that may be used in social interactions, including hair morphology and cuticular odours. In line with a lack of caste-specific traits, adult workers treated developing queens and workers indiscriminately. Together with previous studies demonstrating queen control over sex allocation, these results show that queens control reproductive allocation in C. obscurior and suggest that the fitness interests of colony members are aligned to optimize resource allocation in this ant.",
  "AbstractIn eusocial insects, nestmate queens can differ in their reproductive output, causing asymmetries in the distribution of mutual benefits. However, little is known about how reproductive success is partitioned in incipiently polygynous species, which would provide clues about the evolutionary forces shaping the emergence of polygyny. Here, we leverage a recent transition from predominantly single-queen (monogyne) to multiple-queen (polygyne) colonies in an invasive yellowjacket species to investigate whether queens in incipiently polygyne colonies invest equally in reproductive effort or vary in their relative investment in each caste. We excavated nine polygyne Vespula pensylvanica colonies in Hawaii and used restriction site-associated DNA sequencing to infer the parentage of worker, male, and gyne (daughter queen) pupae from each nest comb. In four colonies with at least eight gyne pupae, a single queen produced most or all gynes. These queens had no male offspring and few worker offspring, suggesting that a subset of nestmate queens might exploit the collective benefits of newly polygyne societies. In contrast to most queens, gyne producers had offspring distributed nonrandomly across nest combs. Nestmate queens generally exhibited low relatedness levels. Our results suggest that rapid, ecologically driven transitions to polygyny among unrelated queens may, at their onset, be vulnerable to reproductive asymmetries that are likely evolutionarily unstable. More broadly, this study contributes to the understanding of social evolution by uncovering asymmetric partitioning of reproduction in a population with newly evolved polygyny and raises questions about the future trajectories of introduced populations.",
  "The labial gland is a major exocrine gland in the thoracic cavity of ants, which is connected to the mouth area and opens at the base of the labium. The labial gland in the various castes and males of Camponotus japonicus were examined using dissection, light microscopy, scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Our findings reveal clear caste differences in the appearance of the labial gland, and suggest a relationship between gland structure and its behavioral role in queens, males and workers: queens possess the largest reservoir sac; males have the smallest; workers have abundant secretion droplets in the gland cells of the tubules; epithelial thickness of gland cells varies considerably between workers and reproductive ants. The apical cell region has a high density of microvilli and polymorphic mitochondria, whereas the central cell region is rich in rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) which means its main secretions are proteinaceous compounds. We believe that the labial gland has a different function in the castes of C. japonicus: the gland of workers and queens may be used to feed the larvae; workers participate in trophallaxis in the nest, while the males are not involved in these activities. Calculations of the relative size of the labial gland for each caste and males indicated that minor workers have the relative highest developed labial gland, supporting a role in trophallaxis. In addition, we found a phenomenon of enlarged labial gland in minor workers, which accounted for almost 22%, but the reason for this is unknown.",
  "BACKGROUND: Camponotus floridanus ant colonies are comprised of a single reproductive queen and thousands of sterile female offspring that consist of two morphologically distinct castes: smaller minors and larger majors. Minors perform most of the tasks within the colony, including brood care and food collection, whereas majors have fewer clear roles and have been hypothesized to act as a specialized solider caste associated with colony defense. The allocation of workers to these different tasks depends, in part, on the detection and processing of local information including pheromones and other chemical blends such as cuticular hydrocarbons. However, the role peripheral olfactory sensitivity plays in establishing and maintaining morphologically distinct worker castes and their associated behaviors remains largely unexplored. RESULTS: We examined the electrophysiological responses to general odorants, cuticular extracts, and a trail pheromone in adult minor and major C. floridanus workers, revealing that the repertoire of social behaviors is positively correlated with olfactory sensitivity. Minors in particular display primarily excitatory responses to olfactory stimuli, whereas major workers primarily manifest suppressed, sub-solvent responses. The notable exception to this paradigm is that both minors and majors display robust, dose-dependent excitatory responses to conspecific, non-nestmate cuticular extracts. Moreover, while both minors and majors actively aggress non-nestmate foes, the larger and physiologically distinct majors display significantly enhanced capabilities to rapidly subdue and kill their adversaries. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies reveal the behavioral repertoire of minors and majors aligns with profound shifts in peripheral olfactory sensitivity and odor coding. The data reported here support the hypothesis that minors are multipotential workers with broad excitatory sensitivity, and majors are dedicated soldiers with a highly specialized olfactory system for distinguishing non-nestmate foes. Overall, we conclude that C. floridanus majors do indeed represent a physiologically and behaviorally specialized soldier caste in which caste-specific olfactory sensitivity plays an important role in task allocation and the regulation of social behavior in ant colonies.",
  "Sociality has evolved several times and is a key strategy for overcoming environmental challenges and promoting ecological success. Yet, it remains unclear how environmental conditions shape global variation in social traits of animals. With their diverse societies and global distribution, ants are ideal to test whether environmental conditions influence the distribution of animal social traits worldwide. Here, we used trait data for a total of 3,299 ant species to explore how three key social traits (reproductive structure, colony size, and worker polymorphism) vary with environmental conditions globally. We show that trait compositions are strongly structured by biomes, indicating that habitat types, as well as environmental factors like temperature and seasonality, influence sociality. Our findings highlight the crucial role of the environment in shaping the global distribution of sociality in ants, contributing to a better understanding of how complex animal societies evolved.",
  "Eusocial hymenoptera recognize nestmates based on colony-specific profiles of cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs). While these profiles contain a variety of alkanes, the less abundant alkenes are crucial for nestmate recognition [F. R. Dani et al., Chem. Senses 30, 477-489 (2005)]. However, due to their carbon-carbon double bonds, alkenes can easily become degraded by oxidants. One of those oxidants, ozone, that usually reaches concentrations of 10 ppb in nonurban areas and ca 30 ppb in cities nowadays has been reported to often exceed 100 ppb in highly polluted regions, with levels above 200 ppb occasionally reported. Here, we show that short exposure to such elevated levels degrades alkenes in CHC profiles of all six investigated ant species and compromises nestmate recognition in five of them. Furthermore, a separate experiment with long-term exposure to such ozone levels corrupted brood care behavior within ant colonies, resulting in the death of larvae. The oxidizing pollutants like ozone have already been shown to corrupt interactions of flowers and their pollinators [B. Cook et al., J. Chem. Biol. 46, 987-996 (2020)] as well as sex pheromone communication in multiple species of flies [N. J. Jiang et al., Nat. Commun. 14 (2023)]. Our data suggest that the detrimental effects of oxidant pollutants may be even more far-reaching by jeopardizing the functionality of eusocial colonies.",
  "On the face of growing pesticide contamination in the environment, non-target species of insects face serious threats in the ecosystem, ranging from species decline to behavioural changes. Social insects living in colonies are vulnerable to the multimodal effects of pesticide contamination, especially when they are relocating their nests. Nest relocation is a goal-oriented task in eusocial species, which exposes the whole colony to environmental stressors like pesticide contamination. In this context, we investigated the effect of a pyrethroid pesticide, alpha-cypermethrin, on the colony relocation of a non-target ponerine ant, Diacamma indicum. Using field-relevant cypermethrin contamination and simulating natural conditions of nest relocations, we asked if ant colonies would be able to relocate through a contaminated terrain. Furthermore, we tested the effect of prior exposure to pesticide contamination on nest choice during colony relocation using a T-maze set-up. Testing seventy naturally collected D. indicum colonies across five different relocation scenarios, we found cypermethrin impacted behaviour, relocation dynamics and nest choice. Five pesticide-induced behaviours (paralysis, trembling, appendage shaking, staggering and twitching) were identified and quantified. Although the majority of the colonies successfully relocated to the new nest, relocating through a contaminated terrain significantly delayed the process by 2.6 times compared to control colonies. Individual task performance was impaired as only half of the tandem leaders were working in treatment colonies. Interestingly, none of these leaders died, even though an average of 20% of the colony showed either paralysis or mortality a day after exposure. Colonies without prior exposure to pesticides preferred non-contaminated nests over contaminated ones, while colonies living in pesticide-contaminated environment randomly chose either the contaminated or control nest. Our results highlight the disruptive role of pesticide contamination on colony relocation and nest choice in a non-target ant species, and highlight the need to understand the effects of pesticides on aspects of life history other than foraging in both target and non-target species for a comprehensive understanding.",
  "The red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta) is an invasive species recognized for its aggressive behavior, posing significant risks to human health and local ecosystems. Pathogenic microbes, including fungi, bacteria, and viruses, play a critical role in the population of this pest and limiting its damage. Recent studies highlight the essential functions of gut microbiota, particularly bacteria, in enhancing S. invicta's immune responses to these pathogens. This review examines the diversity of gut microbiota in S. invicta, elucidating their contributions to immunity against pathogenic infections and their impact on the ant's overall activity and behavior. Previous studies indicate that the gut microbiota of S. invicta comprises various bacterial genera, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Actinobacteria, Staphylococcus, Lactococcus, Ralstonia, Achromobacter, and Lansdales, which play vital roles, particularly in digestion, nutrient synthesis, and immune function against pathogens. Furthermore, the composition of gut microbiota significantly influences foraging efficiency and social interactions within S. invicta colonies. Therefore, understanding the role of gut microbiota in the behavior and activity of S. invicta provides valuable insights for developing effective management strategies to control their populations. This review summarizes previous research on gut microbiota in S. invicta, focusing on its ecological significance and implications for future pest management studies.",
  "Trade-offs between quantity and quality are common in the organization and evolution of biological, technological, and economic systems. In social insects, shifts from solitary organisms to complex societies bring this dilemma to the colony scale: producing fewer robust units or many cheaper ones. We investigate how cuticle investment, a major nutritional cost, shaped the evolution of ant societies and diversification. Using a computer vision approach on three-dimensional x-ray microtomography scans of 880 specimens from 507 species, we show that larger colonies were facilitated by reducing exoskeleton investment rather than miniaturizing workers. Reduced cuticle investment was associated with accelerated diversification rates in ants, whereas other candidates-colony size and worker size-did not correlate with diversification. Diet and climate had measurable but secondary effects on cuticle investment. Our results support a hypothesis whereby evolving cheaper but more numerous units through reduced investment in structural tissues was a strategic trend in the evolution and diversification of complex insect societies.",
  "Variation in ant colony queen number has repeatedly and independently evolved to be controlled by non-recombining supergenes, whose origins remain enigmatic. A new study describes an ancient gene duplication underlying queen winglessness within a younger supergene, providing novel insight into supergene evolution.",
  "Ants primarily communicate via pheromones, and other modes of communication have remained understudied. A new paper shows that fire ant workers employ substrate-borne vibrations to induce the killing and cannibalism of young queens when the colony is starved, showing that ant communication can be multifaceted.",
  "Understanding the stable coexistence of species despite resource competition has been a central topic in ecology. Ant communities are particularly enigmatic as various species coexist despite resource overlap. Community ecology theory predicts stable species coexistence when intraspecific competition is stronger than interspecific competition, but due to their perennial and underground life, competition coefficients of ants have never been rigorously measured in the field. We tackled this problem by studying Diacamma cf. indicum, which allows for noninvasive mark-recapture of whole colonies. Several ant species coexisted at the study site where Diacamma was most abundant, and baiting experiments and stable isotope analyses suggested overlapping food niches. Consistently, per worker brood production of Diacamma colonies was significantly negatively correlated with con- and heterospecific worker densities within the foraging area, suggesting exploitative competition among the ants. In terms of net population growth, however, the estimated intraspecific competition coefficient was about five times larger than the interspecific competition coefficient. This is possibly because exploitative competition for food occurs both intra- and interspecifically, whereas interference competition occurs mostly among conspecifics. Indeed, for Diacamma worker survival, there was a significant (nonlinear) negative correlation only with the density of conspecific colonies within the foraging area. This is consistent with the observation that Diacamma rarely fought with other species, although it violently attacked conspecific aliens encountered in their nest vicinity. We interpreted these results in light of the recent theory of intraspecific adaptation load. This theory predicts that density-dependent adaptation to intraspecific conflict can intensify intraspecific competition and act to suppress per capita population growth in dominant species, thereby leading to species coexistence with overlapping resources. Our inclusive fitness model suggests that the intraspecific territorial aggression in Diacamma may be a counter-adaptation to intraspecific conflict, that is, brood abduction between conspecific colonies. This aggression pattern can cause the observed density-dependent worker mortality. Our population dynamic model indicates that such density-dependent excess mortality acting on dominant competitors can promote stable coexistence with subordinate competitors. Overall, our results support the intraspecific adaptation load theory that aims at integrating behavioral and community ecology to understand how adaptation interacts with population and community dynamics.",
  "The Metazoa encompasses inordinate lineages of symbionts and ecological specialists that obligately depend on particular hosts. The maintenance and fidelity of these lifestyles are often posited to hinge on sensory tuning to host-derived cues, a paradigm supported by studies of neural function in host-specific models. We experimentally reconstituted a socially complex relationship between an obligately symbiotic rove beetle and its single, natural host ant species, permitting us to probe its sensory basis. We show that cuticular hydrocarbons-the ant's nestmate recognition pheromones-elicit host recognition by the beetle and the execution of ant grooming behavior, enabling the beetle to chemically mimic its host and infiltrate the nest as a parasitic impostor. The beetle also follows host trail pheromones, permitting inter-colony dispersal. Yet the beetle also performs these symbiotic behaviors with non-host ants separated by up to ∼95 million years, is able to socially assimilate into their colonies, and shows minimal sensory preference for its natural host over non-host species. Agent-based modeling reveals that the specificity of the beetle emerges not from sensory tuning but from physiological limits on dispersal and negative fitness interactions with alternative hosts, constraining the otherwise promiscuous beetle to its natural host. Recreating the in silico model with living insects empirically demonstrates specificity arising from these enforcing barriers. Our findings show how entrenched symbioses can obviate selection for taxonomically precise host recognition, with specificity emerging from forces external to the symbiont. Chance realization of latent compatibilities with alternative hosts may facilitate host switching, explaining the diversification and deep-time success of such taxa.",
  "Sick individuals often conceal their disease status to group members, thereby preventing social exclusion or aggression. Here we show by behavioural, chemical, immunological and infection load analyses that sick ant pupae instead actively emit a chemical signal that in itself is sufficient to trigger their own destruction by colony members. In our experiments, this altruistic disease-signalling was performed only by worker but not queen pupae. The lack of signalling by queen pupae did not constitute cheating behaviour, but reflected their superior immune capabilities. Worker pupae suffered from extensive pathogen replication whereas queen pupae were able to restrain their infection. Our data suggest the evolution of a finely-tuned signalling system in which it is not the induction of an individual's immune response, but rather its failure to overcome the infection, that triggers pupal signalling for sacrifice. This demonstrates a balanced interplay between individual and social immunity that efficiently achieves whole-colony health.",
  "Supergenes play an important role in the evolution of complex phenotypes, locking specific combinations of alleles.1,2,3 One such complex phenotype is social polymorphism in ants, i.e., the presence of single (monogyne) or multiple (polygyne) reproductive queens within colonies, known to be determined by social supergenes in at least five lineages.4,5 This polymorphism is associated with divergent individual and colonial traits, some linked to dispersal.6 We explored the idea that antagonistic selection between social forms favors the emergence of regions of suppressed recombination. To this end, we studied the ant Myrmecina graminicola, in which a social polymorphism is coupled with the presence/absence of wings in queens. We discovered a new \"social supergene\" of ∼20 Mb with three haplotypes. Supergene genotypes determine the three queen phenotypes observed in nature: monogyne winged, monogyne apterous, and polygyne apterous. The two haplotypes associated with aptery carry an additional copy of a gene probably involved in wing development as part of a ∼116 kb insertion predating the origin of the social supergene (∼20 vs. ∼1 mya). Syntenic analyses showcased an independent evolution of the social supergene. The screening of workers' genotypes suggests that assortative mating and segregation distortion may play a role in preserving supergene polymorphism. This unique supergene system illustrates the theoretically expected genetic link between social polymorphism and dispersal in ants. Its modular evolution mirrors the role of sexually antagonistic selection in the origin of sex chromosomes and makes ants a very promising model for studying supergene evolution.",
  "Ants employ a wide range of communication systems to coordinate colony functions, with chemical signals being the most extensively studied. While investigating social regulation in the invasive fire ant Solenopsis invicta, we discovered a striking behavior: under food-deprived conditions, workers frequently cannibalize a high proportion of virgin queens. Our experiments revealed that this behavior is triggered by nutritional stress and mediated by a specific vibrational signal (stridulation) produced by workers and directed at young queens. Chemical analyses showed no significant differences in cuticular hydrocarbons between targeted and non-targeted queens, providing no evidence that chemical cues are responsible for this behavior. In contrast, playback experiments demonstrated that queen cannibalism is directly induced by vibrational signals. These findings uncover a previously unrecognized role for stridulation in regulating social behavior and challenge the notion that non-chemical communication is secondary in ants.",
  "To deal with the unpredictability of available food resources, animals must adjust their behaviour to optimise foraging efficiency. Various mechanisms influence food acquisition behaviour, and our knowledge of their combined impact on foraging efficiency often remains limited. In this study, we conducted laboratory experiments with seven colonies of the solitary foraging ant Dinoponera quadriceps. We observed the behaviour of foragers in an experimental set-up where ten food items were provided either in aggregated or dispersed distributions. Individual participation was voluntary (i.e., ants were free to enter or not the experimental arena), allowing us to assess internal processes like motivation for foraging. We recorded, across repeated trials, foraging activity and exploratory behaviour as proxies for foraging motivation, and success as a measure of efficiency. We found that foragers were highly efficient (retrieving food in 77.38 % of the trips), especially when exploiting aggregated and abundant food resources. Individual foraging success increased with higher exploration, which was more intense in environments displaying larger numbers of dispersed prey items. Individual activity was higher with more experience and in smaller colonies with fewer foragers. On the other hand, success declined when more conspecific foragers were present. Furthermore, foragers and colonies exhibited low but consistent differences in levels of activity, exploration, and success rates. These findings provide a comprehensive view of how different factors combine to give rise to complex behaviours such as foraging. Additionally, they emphasise the importance of individual traits for effective task performance within social groups, an understudied topic.",
  "Host-parasite relationships are often shaped by coevolutionary arms races. While abiotic influences on these dynamics are well documented, a combined analysis of abiotic and biotic factors is essential for understanding coevolution, particularly under climate change. In this study, we analysed the interactions of the obligate social parasite Temnothorax americanus, a dulotic ant, and its primary host, the ant T. longispinosus, focusing on behavioural and cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) traits that govern parasite invasion and host defence. We studied the link between these traits and local climate as well as parasite prevalence. Our results revealed that behavioural interactions were more strongly associated with climate than parasite prevalence. Hosts from warmer, drier regions exhibited reduced aggression during parasite encounters, opting to pick up the brood and flee, while parasites from these regions exhibited greater aggression and activity. CHCs mediating enemy recognition in these ants were linked to local climate and parasite prevalence in both species. As all colonies were maintained under standardized conditions for a year, we attribute the observed phenotypic traits to evolutionary adaptation rather than phenotypic plasticity. Our findings suggest that both abiotic and biotic factors play critical roles in shaping co-evolving traits, sometimes leading to unexpected patterns that would potentially be overlooked when considering only a single factor. These insights provide a framework for understanding how climate influences coevolution of interacting species.",
  "In animals, group living comes at the cost of increased pathogen exposure. In kin groups, social immune behaviours offset that cost and reach their most complex expression in eusocial insect societies. In the nests of these societies, collective social behaviours can modify the patterns of individual interactions across space, reducing the ability of pathogens to reach the reproductive core of the colony (organizational immunity). To be effective, these behaviours must separate infected and uninfected individuals; implying that the efficacy of social immune behaviours may depend upon nest structure. The role of nest space has received little attention, and most knowledge of social immune behaviour in social insects is based on the study of generalist entomopathogenic fungi. We examine the social immune behaviours involved in the interaction between the supercolonial, invasive tawny crazy ant (Nylanderia fulva) and its specialist, intracellular, microsporidian pathogen Myrmecomorba nylanderiae, to ask how nest structure influences social immunity. By manipulating nest structure, we demonstrate that preventing pathogen transmission to the colony core requires a multi-chambered nest. Without which, social immune function was lost, and disease transmission was universal. To understand how nest space enhances social immune efficacy, we first confirm that workers within tawny crazy ant nests form spatially and behaviourally segregated social sub-networks. We then find that infected ants introduced into the colony core migrate to the colony periphery, while uninfected ants do not. Behavioural tests indicate that, despite the infection being internal, uninfected ants can detect the infection status of a worker; thus, behaviours enforcing spatial segregation could be triggered by either party. Additionally, infected ants alter the behavioural tasks they perform, assuming more corpse removal tasks, particularly infected corpse removal, and reducing their efforts in foraging and brood care. With some exceptions, the social immune behaviours expressed by this supercolonial ant in response to microsporidian infection correspond to immune defence behaviours employed to defend against generalist entomopathogenic fungi. These behaviours appear to be conserved, generalized responses to pathogen infection among social insects.",
  "The present study is a systematic review of the main ecological aspects of nest foundation and the subterranean architecture of established and mature of leaf-cutting ants of the genus Atta. The foundation of nests by queens, burrowing behavior, and abiotic factors affecting the success of colonies and nest distribution of these ants are discussed. The excavation of a vertical tunnel and the first chamber made by a single mated queen begin the nest foundation. Internal network of galleries and chambers in a highly complex architecture compose a mature nest of the Atta genus. The size, number, shape and position of the chambers vary with ant species, substrate, nest age and number of workers. The size of chambers is enlarged over time to allow fungus growth. A tunnel system connects chambers and underground part of the nest to the soil surface. The section of the tunnels is, in general, elliptical or circular, allowing workers and soldiers to move during nest excavation, maintenance, and foraging activities. The present review provides a detailed description of one the most complex and specialized subterranean nests of social insects.",
  "Thirty years of research into activity rhythms of ant colonies have contributed an improved understanding of this fascinating form of collective behavior. Yet, little is known about how the colony size influences the intensity and tempo of the rhythms. Here, we address this knowledge gap through a two-pronged approach, combining the re-evaluation of published experimental observations on California ant, Temnothorax rudis, with the formulation of a novel mathematical model. From the analysis of published data, we discover that the period of the activity bursts is nearly independent of the colony size, while the number of ants activated during the bursts scales hypometrically with the colony size. In search of the biological mechanisms underpinning this evidence, we put forward a compartmental model consisting of three classes: active, inactive, and refractory ants. The study of the resulting system of nonlinear delay-differential equations explains the emergence of activity rhythms as stable limit cycles. The period of these limit cycles is controlled by the refractory delay for the resting phase, independently of the colony size, but their amplitude allometrically varies with the colony size due to social deactivation. During activity rhythms, ants spontaneously deactivate when socially interacting with active individuals.",
  "Large independently evolved supergenes control colony social organization and queen reproductive strategies in several ant lineages. Their independent origins, as well as the similarities of the associated phenotypes, make ant supergenes a promising system for studying the parallel evolution of genome organization and adaptability. However, the genetic basis of differences in social organization and queen phenotypes remains unknown in many ant species, limiting the potential power of this system for comparative studies. We investigated the genetic basis of colony social organization in the queen-size dimorphic ant Myrmica ruginodis by sampling 95 queens from 31 colonies in southern Finland. Whole-genome sequencing revealed a novel 9 Mb supergene associated with both queen size and social organization. Queens homozygous for the AA haplotype were larger and found only in single-queen colonies, while queens in multiple-queen colonies were smaller and carried only AB and BB genotypes. This supergene is not homologous to previously identified supergenes in ants, suggesting it arose through a distinct evolutionary pathway.",
  "BACKGROUND: While ants are textbook examples of eusocial animals in which altruistic behavior is maintained through kin selection, several ants form genetically diverse colonies that challenge this concept. One example is the Australian green-head ant (Rhytidoponera metallica) whose colonies harbor such extreme genetic variation that they have been speculated to represent an unstable form of eusociality. Yet, R. metallica is among the most successful ants on the Australian subcontinent. This success has been hypothesized to be partly due to the diverse venoms harbored within each colony. However, the genomic basis and evolutionary scenarios that maintain this toxin diversity remain unknown. RESULTS: To examine toxin genomic architecture, quantify individual-level genetic variation, and identify both proximate and ultimate mechanisms that have facilitated the toxin diversity in R. metallica, we generate a high-quality draft genome from a single worker. Most ectatotoxin genes are in clusters that contain evidence of multiple, complex gene-family expansions, some of which are likely explained by the presence of transposable elements. We also show that toxin regions of the genome exhibit elevated genetic variation despite being under strong selection and that this variation can translate to phenotypic diversity through toxin alleles with different functional properties. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results point to classical gene duplication and diversification as the main evolutionary mechanism by which the main toxin family in ant venoms evolves, suggest toxin-gene functional diversification under frequency-dependent selection maintains colony-level venom hypervariability in R. metallica, and provide new insight into the role of multi-level selection in eusocial animals.",
  "The Pharaoh ant, Monomorium pharaonis (L.), is a widely distributed invasive tramp ant species. Due to their ability to frequently relocate nest sites when disturbed, Pharaoh ants are particularly challenging to manage. This study examined the colony movement patterns of different colony sizes of the Pharaoh ant in response to chemical disturbances caused by varying over-the-counter aerosol insecticide application rates. Three aerosol products, 3 application rates, and 4 colony sizes were tested. Essential oil-based insecticides exhibited a higher probability of inducing budding at all colony sizes when applied at a high rate. In contrast, pyrethroid-based insecticides increased the probability of inducing budding at a low application rate. The number of workers present outside the main nest in the essential oil-based insecticide-treated group decreased with increasing application rate, whereas the number of workers present outside the main nest increased in pyrethroid-based insecticide-treated groups. Furthermore, the density of workers outside the main nest appeared to play a role in influencing the final nest site after budding. The number of worker ant carcasses observed on pyrethroid-treated surfaces was significantly greater than on surfaces treated with the essential oil-based insecticide and controls. The effects of aerosol product type, colony size, and insecticide application rate on Pharaoh ant colony movement are discussed.",
  "Obligatory interspecific brood raiding is a unique form of parasitism in which one ant species steals pupae from another species and raises them into workers to perform duties within its nest. Although this strategy can support very large colonies, the relative species abundance of these social parasites is always low. Using fully parameterized mathematical models of the growth and reproduction of the well-studied interaction between brood raider Polyergus and its hosts in the genus Formica, we aim to discover the mechanisms that limit brood raider abundance. These mathematical models explain the range of observed relative species abundance of these social parasites and provide a criterion for Polyergus persistence within a patch of hosts. In particular, Polyergus colony survival depends on the number of host colonies between 23 and 73 meters from their nest-close enough to raid but distant enough to survive raiding. The number sets the upper bound of Polyergus abundance to be less than 10% of the community. Furthermore, we quantify the fitness costs imposed by brood raiding on nearby host colonies, which can be effectively castrated by the constant drain on their worker resources. These findings provide a mechanistic framework for understanding the ecological constraints on social parasitism, its role in shaping ant community dynamics and its connection to the evolution of host defense strategies.",
  "Biological rhythms are essential components of organisms' physiology and behavior. In social insects, biological rhythms can be studied at varying levels of a colony, revealing interesting aspects about how rhythms arise from the individual and collective levels. Here, by developing a video-tracking software based on machine learning techniques, we investigated the emergent collective rhythms of a leaf-cutter ant colony under laboratory conditions. The colony displayed rhythmic, daily foraging activity, with most of its foraging occurring during the dark phase of the day. The same pattern is found in the leaf-cutting activity. After being exposed to a 6-hour phase shift of the light-dark cycle, the daily rhythm of colony activity resynchronized with the new cycle phase after a few transient days. During these transient days, an increase in its daily leaf intake was measured. Under synchronized conditions, the ratio between foraging and leaf intake of the colony was higher during the light phase and decreased in the transient days after the phase shift, revealing that temporal synchronization plays an important role in the organization of the colony. Our findings illustrate the dynamic aspects of temporal synchronization in complex eusocial systems, pointing to these systems as exciting new models for comparative research.",
  "Cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) are ubiquitous among insects where they form an outer wax layer that helps maintain water balance and prevent desiccation. In social insects, CHCs were subsequently co-opted as semiochemicals in many contexts, including nestmate recognition, which maintains boundaries among competing colonies by ousting non-nestmates. In some ant populations, workers do not discriminate against non-nestmates. This leads to the development of supercolonies, a large network of interconnected nests exchanging unrelated individuals. In this study, we investigate CHC production by workers and their resistance to desiccation in the ant Nylanderia fulva, which exhibits supercolonial behavior within its invasive range in the USA. We found reduced CHC production by workers and increased susceptibility toward desiccation compared to other invasive ants of similar body size. This CHC-poor chemical profile sheds light on the susceptibility of this species to abiotic stress through desiccation with implications for its potential distribution and its development of large supercolonies in its invasive range by impairing nestmate recognition.",
  "Supergenes are large clusters of linked genes that control complex phenotypes. In several ant clades, supergenes determine whether one or multiple queens reproduce in mature colonies, but how supergenes affect colony social structure has been inferred indirectly. We show experimentally that a supergene in Formica ant workers alters the social structure (single- or multi-queen) of developing colonies. We crossed queens and males carrying alternative social supergene genotypes, and let the queens establish single-queen colonies, which we paired in the laboratory. The presence of a paternally-inherited P haplotype in workers was sufficient to make the colonies more likely to fuse and become multi-queened, regardless of the genotype of their mother. The dominant effect of the P haplotype on colony social structure likely contributes to the spread of multi-queen colonies. This controlled experiment provides direct evidence that the P haplotype in workers steers social organization towards multiple queens during early colony ontogeny.",
  "Cecropia obtusa is a Neotropical myrmecophyte (i.e., plant sheltering ant colonies in hollow structures in exchange for protection against different enemies) that, in French Guiana, is associated with the dolichoderine ants Azteca alfari or A. ovaticeps that nest in this tree's internodes and are provided food, mostly food bodies called Müllerian bodies. We show that the workers of the ectatommine ant Ectatomma tuberculatum are able to select small C. obtusa individuals (i.e., they were never noted on trees more than 3 m tall) to ambush the Azteca workers exiting the entrance holes to the internodes on these trees. Their presence is more frequent diurnally when the Azteca must leave their nest to harvest Müllerian bodies, whose production requires sunlight, than at night. We witnessed 36 E. tuberculatum foragers ambushing Azteca workers, then seizing and stinging them. Exceptionally, they captured three Azteca workers successively. In all cases, they retrieved them by carrying them between their mandibles. These results confirm that E. tuberculatum foragers, which nest at the base of different tree species, are well adapted to ambushing insect prey, including social insects exiting their nests.",
  "Ants and termites are ubiquitous members of most modern terrestrial ecosystems. These insects act as agents of selection among plants and animals, driving ecological and evolutionary shifts in disparate groups across the tree of life. Obligate consumers of ants or termites, called myrmecophages, exhibit morphological adaptations such as lengthened tongues and reduced teeth that are associated with a bulk feeding strategy. Though a typifying feature of some mammal lineages, the macroevolutionary history of obligate myrmecophagy and its relationship to social insect evolution is unknown. We report large-scale patterns of myrmecophagous evolution through a synthesis of the social insect fossil record, ant and termite evolutionary history, and mammal natural history data spanning 4,099 species. Specialized ant and termite feeding has arisen at least 12 times in mammals and through multiple pathways; transitions to myrmecophagy stem from insectivorous and carnivorous ancestors. We recover one reversal out of social insect feeding, perhaps owing to food source stability or difficulty in regaining generalist features. Despite the contemporary ubiquity of social insects, their history suggests a recent capacity for specialist consumers. While both lineages originated in the Cretaceous, rising fossil prevalence of ants and termites and their acquisition of large colony sizes predominantly occurred in the Cenozoic.",
  "Parasites pose significant challenges not only to individual hosts but also to entire social groups. We investigated the effects of parasitism by the cestode Anomotaenia brevis on colonies of its intermediate host, the ant Temnothorax nylanderi. We evaluated changes in worker and queen survival rates and transcriptional activity in the fat body of infected and uninfected workers, as well as in the parasite itself, in relation to infected worker prevalence and colony size. Cestode-infected workers are known to exhibit a significantly extended lifespan compared with uninfected workers. Here, we demonstrate that the survival rates of infected workers, uninfected queens, and uninfected workers decrease with increasing infected worker prevalence and increase with colony size. Transcriptomic analysis revealed stress-related signatures in all workers, regardless of infection status, as infection prevalence increased. Moreover, gene expression patterns, particularly in uninfected workers, were strongly influenced by colony size. The transcriptional activity of the parasitic cestode also shifted with infected worker prevalence, highlighting the complex dynamics of host-parasite interactions. These results demonstrate that parasites in social species impose colony-wide impacts that extend beyond infected individuals, even in the absence of direct cross-nestmate infection risks. Moreover, the consequences of parasitism can be modulated by colony size.",
  "In eusocial insects, social parasitism-the exploitation of the host's brood care behavior for survival and reproduction-can occur either within or between species. Parasitic queens invade host nests and aggressively replace the resident queen. While the adoption of conspecific queens is a common feature of species with multiqueen colonies (polygyny), the origin of parasitic founding is not fully understood. Functionally monogynous ants, in which nestmate queens establish social and reproductive hierarchies through biting and antennal boxing, may provide a link between peaceful adoption and social parasitism. In this study, we investigated whether alien queens can usurp colonies of the functionally monogynous ant Leptothorax gredleri. Ovary dissection of queens from 33 nests showed that multiple queens with developed ovaries can occasionally co-occur in the same nest. Genetic analysis revealed frequent replacement of the dominant queens by relatives. Instead, alien queens rarely take over reproduction, suggesting a few occurrences of intraspecific social parasitism. However, the data suggest that alien queens without developed ovaries frequently invade nests without being eliminated. This suggests that alien queens are somehow prevented from reproducing and social parasitism is therefore limited in this species.",
  "Understanding the collective foraging strategies of ant colonies is essential for studying self-organization and collective behavior in biological systems. This study introduces a simplified foraging model that classifies worker roles into two functional groups-available workers and active foragers-providing a concise yet effective framework for analyzing foraging dynamics. Our model effectively reproduces the foraging dynamics observed in more complex three-dimensional models, while taking a more tractable form that is more conducive to mathematical analysis. We examine the effects of stochasticity in mortality rates of foragers and workers on foraging state transitions, with a particular emphasis on the critical noise threshold, transition probability, and transition time. While the critical noise threshold is reduced by stochasticity in either of the two mortality rates, that of active foragers has the greatest effect. We find that slight increases in the arrival rate of available workers and the recruitment rate of active foragers enhance the colony's resilience to environmental stochasticity, suggesting that colonies can self-regulate via a feedback loop of foraging and recruitment to maintain their foraging while their environment changes around them. In contrast, varying the mortality rate of available workers had little effect on this resilience, analogously to experimental observations that older or unhealthy worker ants disproportionately transition into foraging roles. This study not only advances our understanding of ant foraging dynamics by simplifying complex models but also provides valuable insights into the robustness of foraging activities under varying environmental conditions.",
  "Genes and the environment jointly shape individual traits, but the influence of indirect genetic effects (IGEs), arising from the genetic composition of interacting conspecific individuals, is often ignored or underemphasized. Moreover, because of practical challenges in characterizing IGEs, empirical research has fallen behind theoretical advancement. The fire ant Solenopsis invicta offers a uniquely suitable study system due to its distinct colony-level phenotypic variation (monogyne and polygyne social forms) attributed to IGEs of a social-supergene variant (b allele). A minority of b-carrying workers (Bb genotype) can trigger colony-level conversion from monogyne (single queen per colony) to polygyne (multiple queens per colony) behavior. This study investigated the mechanisms underlying this process via 400-ant microcolonies. We first showed that assimilated Bb workers reduce aggression by host BB workers toward Bb queens, thus inducing polygyny, at rates observed earlier in experiments that used full-size (>20,000 ants) colonies. We then demonstrated that social conversion is facilitated by cuticular contact between the worker types, and verified the presence of nonvolatile cuticular pheromones that are necessary but not sufficient components underpinning this process. Follow-up experiments suggested that a second, polygyne worker-produced pheromone that is only released once such workers detect a Bb queen is also necessary but again insufficient, for full expression of the conversion phenomenon. Thus, multiple pheromonal components linked to presence of the b supergene allele in colony workers appear to be involved in shaping social environments and thereby inducing, via IGEs, the transformation from monogyne to polygyne fire ant societies.",
  "Communication is a cornerstone of social living, allowing the exchange of information to align goals and synchronize behaviour. Ants, a group of highly successful social insects, have heightened olfactory abilities that are integral to their evolutionary success. Essential for colony cohesion and cooperation, a female-specific olfactory subsystem processes information about nestmate recognition cues (cuticular hydrocarbons), including basiconic sensilla on the antenna and a cluster of specific glomeruli in the antennal lobe. While it has often been linked to ants' social lifestyle, the evolutionary origins and phylogenetic distribution of this system remain unknown. We conducted a comparative exploration of the ant olfactory system across eight major subfamilies, integrating neuroanatomical, chemical and behavioural analyses. Our findings reveal that sophistication of the ant olfactory system has deep evolutionary roots. Moreover, antennal lobe investment is not associated with social traits such as colony size, polygyny or foraging strategies, but correlates with cuticular hydrocarbon profile complexity. Despite neuroanatomical differences, different ant species consistently excel in nestmate discrimination, indicating adaptation to chemical diversity while maintaining reliable social recognition. This suggests that cuticular hydrocarbon profile and neuronal investment in olfactory neuropil have co-evolved to sustain discrimination performance.",
  "This investigation presents a two-dimensional collective foraging model alongside its stochastic counterpart, simplifying the previous more complex three-dimensional framework utilized to examine foraging behaviors within social insect colonies. We first conduct a thorough examination of the global dynamics of the deterministic model. The results show that the two-dimensional model exhibits equilibrium dynamics, with the possibility of coexistence between non-foraging and foraging equilibrium states. This finding highlights the parallelism between the two-dimensional model and the traditional three-dimensional framework. Following this, an extensive exploration into the long-term collective foraging dynamics within a stochastic environment is conducted, elucidating the interplay between stochasticity and the transitions across distinct stable foraging states. Additionally, the investigation assesses the risk of foraging cessation across varying initial worker populations, subsequently delineating foraging termination warning thresholds. The findings illuminate the multifaceted influence of environmental stochasticity on the collective foraging dynamics observed in harvester ant colonies. Grasping these dynamics furnishes valuable understanding of ecological resilience and the adaptive strategies deployed by collective entities in navigating environmental fluctuations.",
  "Social insects such as ants possess a battery of behavioural mechanisms protecting their colonies against pathogens and toxins. Recently, active abandonment of poisoned food was described in the invasive ant Linepithema humile. During this abandonment, foraging declines by 80% within 6-8 h after baits become toxic-a reduction not due to satiety, diminished motivation, or mortality. Here we explore the mechanisms behind this behaviour, testing two hypotheses: (1) the presence of 'no entry' pheromones near toxic food, and (2) the formation of aversive memories linked to the toxic food site. In field trials, we placed bridges leading to sucrose, nothing, or poisoned sucrose on an active trail. Within hours, 80% of ants abandoned poisoned bait bridges. By swapping bridges strategically, we confirmed that aversive memories formed at toxic bait sites, while no evidence of a 'no entry' pheromone was found. Then, in the laboratory, we asked how ants may be sensing the toxicity of the bait, hypothesising poison-induced malaise. Motility, used as a proxy for malaise, was 29% lower in toxicant-exposed ants after 3 h, linking malaise to abandonment. Developing toxicants with delayed malaise, not just delayed mortality, may improve toxic bait control protocols.",
  "Division of labour (DOL) plays a key role across all scales of biological organization, but how its expression varies across contexts is still poorly understood. Here, we measure DOL in a crucial task, colony defence, in a social insect that affords precise experimental control over individual and colony traits, the clonal raider ant (Ooceraea biroi). We find that DOL in defence behaviour emerges within colonies of near-identical workers, likely reflecting variation in individual response thresholds, and that it increases with colony size. Additionally, colonies with pupae show higher defence levels than those without brood. However, we do not find evidence for a behavioural syndrome linking defence with exploration and activity, as previously reported in other systems. By showing how colony composition and size affect group response to potential threats, our findings highlight the role of the social context in shaping DOL.This article is part of the theme issue 'Division of labour as key driver of social evolution'.",
  "Behavioral innovations can be ecologically transformative for lineages that perform them and for their associated communities. Many ecologically dominant, superorganismal, and speciose ant lineages use mouth-to-mouth social regurgitation behavior - stomodeal trophallaxis - to share exogenous and endogenous materials within colonies. This behavior is less common in other species-poor, less cooperative ant lineages. How and why trophallaxis evolved and fixed in only some ant clades remains unclear, and whether this trait could be indicative of superorganismality has yet to be established. Here we show that trophallaxis evolved in two main events, in non-doryline formicoids around 130 Ma and in some ponerines around 90 Ma, lineages that today encompass 86% of all ant species. We found that trophallaxis evolved in lineages that began drinking sugary liquids and that had reduced intra-colonial conflict by constraining worker reproductive potential. Evolution of trophallaxis increased net diversification. Causal models indicate that trophallaxis required low reproductive conflict and contributed to the large colony sizes of the ants that use it. This suggests that the evolution of social regurgitation was enabled by both social conflict reduction and opportunistic inclusion of nectar and honeydew in the ant diet during the shifts in terrestrial ecosystems toward flowering plants.",
  "In animals, metabolic rates during ontogeny often scale differently from the way they do in cross-species or population comparisons, with near-isometric scaling patterns more often observed during juvenile growth. In multiple social insect taxa, colony metabolic rate scales hypometrically across species or populations at the same developmental stage, but metabolic patterns during ontogeny have not been examined for any social insect species. We performed the first ontogenetic study of social metabolic scaling in harvester ant colonies (Pogonomyrmex californicus) over 3.5 years as they grew from 52 [Formula: see text] 12 to 767 [Formula: see text] 380 workers. Our data reveal iso- and hypermetric metabolic scaling during the first 20 months of growth, transitioning to hypometric scaling (scaling exponent = 0.93) thereafter. We discovered that the fraction of colony as brood has dual effects on colonial metabolic rate. A higher fraction of the colony that is brood decreases colonial metabolic rate because brood has approximately half the mass-specific metabolic rates of adult ants. Conversely, metabolic rate and activity of adult ants increase as this fraction increases. We further developed a nonlinear composition model, which shows that the maximal colony metabolic rate occurs when 29% of the colony mass is brood, suggesting that demographic changes and colony size may interact to drive the metabolic scaling.",
  "Recognition protects biological systems at all scales, from cells to societies. Social insects recognize their nestmates by colony-specific olfactory labels that individuals store as neural templates in their memory. Throughout an ant's life, learning continuously shapes the nestmate recognition template to keep up with the constant changes in colony labels.1,2,3,4 Most explanations for template update rely on non-associative learning.5 Indeed, we know that ants become habituated to their colony's label: their reaction to the omnipresent chemical cues typical of their own nest fades.3,6,7,8 However, non-associative habituation cannot explain the enormous variation in nestmate recognition behavior. For example, some ant species are more aggressive toward neighboring colonies than toward unfamiliar colonies (nasty neighbor effect9,10,11,12). Social insects can learn associatively, for example, by associating an odor cue with a food reward.13 A recent model proposes that associative learning of non-nestmate odors leads to variation in the recognition templates among individuals, which then improves recognition at the group level.14 Here, we test whether associative learning of non-nestmate colony odors is possible.11 Our results show that associative learning plays a crucial role in the formation of both nestmate and non-nestmate recognition templates and that the aggression received by an ant acts as an unconditioned stimulus that the ant likely associates with the odor label of its enemy. This type of template learning can help explain different patterns of variation in nestmate recognition, from nasty neighbor effects to task- and age-specific variation in aggression.15,16.",
  "The immune system is crucial for organisms to defend against pathogens. Likewise, analogous immune features evolved against similar pressures at the superorganism scale. Upregulating hygiene to the same fungus pathogen is one assumption for convergent immune mechanisms in social insects, although more evidence of immune memory features remains to be confirmed. Here, we assess immune memory traits at the colony level in the leaf-cutting ant Atta sexdens. We exposed their fungus cultivar to both homologous and heterologous challenges with the entomopathogenic fungi Metarhizium anisopliae and Beauveria bassiana, as well as the mycoantagonistic fungi Fusarium oxysporum and Trichoderma spirale. By measuring ants' behaviours, we evaluated the capacity of A. sexdens: (i) to enhance their collective hygiene, (ii) speed their hygiene in further infections, (iii) how long this capacity lasts in the colonies and (iv) the degree of specificity to increase hygienic responses. Fungus grooming behaviour was enhanced mostly against entomopathogenic fungi, with a trend of faster reactions during homologous challenges. In general, the capacity to elicit such upregulated actions lasted for up to 30 days, but no longer than 60 days. Overall, colonies exhibited a degree of immune specificity, enhancing hygiene only in response to homologous exposures but decreasing it when infected secondarily with a different fungus, indicating flexible social immunity of A. sexdens after immune challenges.",
  "Despite almost a century of research on energetics in biological systems, we still cannot explain energy regulation in social groups, like ant colonies. How do individuals regulate their collective activity without a centralized control system? What is the role of social interactions in distributing the workload amongst group members? And how does the group save energy by avoiding being constantly active? We offer new insight into these questions by studying an intuitive compartmental model, calibrated with and compared to data on ant colonies. The model describes a previously unexplored balance between positive and negative social feedback driven by individual activity: when activity levels are low, the presence of active individuals stimulates inactive individuals to start working; when activity levels are high, however, active individuals inhibit each other, effectively capping the proportion of active individuals at any one time. Through the analysis of the system's stability, we demonstrate that this balance results in energetic spending at the group level growing proportionally slower than the group size. Our finding is reminiscent of Kleiber's law of metabolic scaling in unitary organisms and highlights the critical role of social interactions in driving the collective energetic efficiency of group-living organisms.",
  "Emergence is a fundamental concept in biology and other disciplines, but whether emergent phenotypes evolve similarly to nonemergent phenotypes is unclear. The hypothesized process of emergent evolution posits that evolutionary change in at least some collective behaviors will differ from evolutionary change in the corresponding intrinsic behaviors of isolated individuals. As a result, collective behavior might evolve more rapidly and diversify more between populations compared to individual behavior. To test whether collective behavior evolves emergently, we conducted a large comparative study using 22 ant species and gathered over 1,500 behavioral rhythm time series from hundreds of colonies and isolated individuals, totaling over 1.5 y of behavioral data. We show that analogous traits measured at individual and collective levels exhibit distinct evolutionary patterns. The estimated rates of phenotypic evolution for the rhythmicity of activity in ant colonies were faster than the evolutionary rates of the same behavior measured in isolated individual ants, and total variation across species in collective behavior was higher than variation in individual behavior. We hypothesize that more rapid evolution and higher variation is a widespread feature of emergent phenotypes relative to lower-level phenotypes across complex biological systems.",
  "A long-term study of a population of desert seed-eating ant colonies of the red harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex barbatus, in New Mexico, USA, shows that a colony can live for 20-30 years-the lifespan of its founding queen. A colony's collective behaviour shifts in the course of its life history. These changes, generated by social interactions within the colony, adjust the behaviour of the colony as it grows older and larger, in response to its environment and neighbouring colonies. A worker lives only a year and performs different tasks as it ages, in response to interactions with other workers and the local surroundings. A colony's behaviour changes-becoming more stable and consistent-as the colony grows older, with more ants to participate in social interactions. A neighbourhood of colonies, often of similar age, grows old together. Colonies differ in how they regulate foraging behaviour collectively to manage water loss. These differences influence how foragers of neighbouring colonies partition foraging area. In a harsh but stable environment, the gradual behavioural shifts over a colony's lifespan allow it to adjust to slow changes in the composition of its neighbourhood and in environmental conditions.This article is part of the discussion meeting issue 'Understanding age and society using natural populations'.",
  "When risk is unpredictable, organisms may evolve induced defenses, which are activated after an indication of increased risk. In colonies with behavioural specialization, investment in defence may not be uniformly beneficial among group members. Instead, it should depend on the individual's likelihood of participating in defence. The ant Temnothorax longispinosus uses venom to defend against raids by the social parasite Temnothorax americanus. We tested whether T. longispinosus upregulate investment in venom after experiencing a raid, investigating the relationship between venom volume and worker behavioural caste. Overall, raided colonies had more venom per capita than unraided colonies. When divided into behavioural castes, foragers had more venom after experiencing a raid, while nurses did not. These results demonstrate that T. longispinosus have an induced chemical defence against parasitic raids. However, instead of this defence being deployed uniformly among all workers, the induction of the defence depends on the behavioural caste, and therefore age, of the worker, implying that plasticity in venom production increases with age. Since older social insect workers tend to perform riskier tasks, inducibility may align with an increase in expected risk of death, especially if foragers are more likely to defend the colony against parasites than younger workers.",
  "Communication allows members of a collective to share information about their environment. Advanced collective systems, such as multicellular organisms and social insect colonies, vary in whether they use communication at all and, if they do, in what types of signals they use, but the origins of these differences are poorly understood. Here, we develop a theoretical framework to investigate the evolution and diversity of communication strategies under collective-level selection. We find that whether communication can evolve depends on a collective's external environment: communication only evolves in sufficiently stable environments, where the costs of sensing are high enough to disfavour independent sensing but not so high that the optimal strategy is to ignore the environment altogether. Moreover, we find that the evolution of diverse signalling strategies-including those relying on prolonged signalling (e.g. honeybee waggle dance), persistence of signals in the environment (e.g. ant trail pheromones) and brief but frequent communicative interactions (e.g. ant antennal contacts)-can be explained theoretically in terms of the interplay between the demands of the environment and internal constraints on the signal. Altogether, we provide a general framework for comparing communication strategies found in nature and uncover simple ecological principles that may contribute to their diversity.",
  "Polyergus kidnapper ants are widely distributed, but relatively uncommon, throughout the Holarctic, spanning an elevational range from sea level to over 3,000 m. These species are well known for their obligate social parasitism with various Formica ant species, which they kidnap in dramatic, highly coordinated raids. Kidnapped Formica larvae and pupae become integrated into the Polyergus colony where they develop into adults and perform nearly all of the necessary colony tasks for the benefit of their captors. In California, Polyergus mexicanus is the most widely distributed Polyergus, but recent evidence has identified substantial genetic polymorphism within this species, including genetically divergent lineages associated with the use of different Formica host species. Given its unique behavior and genetic diversity, P. mexicanus plays a critical role in maintaining ecosystem balance by influencing the population dynamics and genetic diversity of its host ant species, Formica, highlighting its conservation value and importance in the context of biodiversity preservation. Here, we present a high-quality genome assembly of P. mexicanus from a sample collected in Plumas County, CA, United States, in the foothills of the central Sierra Nevada. This genome assembly consists of 364 scaffolds spanning 252.31 Mb, with contig N50 of 481,250 kb, scaffold N50 of 10.36 Mb, and Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) completeness of 95.4%. We also assembled the genome of the Wolbachia endosymbiont of P. mexicanus-a single, circular contig spanning 1.23 Mb. These genome sequences provide essential resources for future studies of conservation genetics, population genetics, speciation, and behavioral ecology in this charismatic social insect.",
  "Chemoreceptors help insects to interact with their environment, to detect and assess food sources and oviposition sites, and to aid in intra- and interspecific communication. In Hymenoptera, species of eusocial lineages possess large chemoreceptor gene repertoires compared with solitary species, possibly because of their additional need to recognize nest-mates and caste. However, a critical piece of information missing so far has been the size of chemoreceptor gene repertoires of solitary apoid wasps. Apoid wasps are a paraphyletic group of almost exclusively solitary Hymenoptera phylogenetically positioned between ant and bee, both of which include eusocial species. We report the chemosensory-related gene repertoire sizes of three apoid wasps: Ampulex compressa, Cerceris arenaria, and Psenulus fuscipennis. We annotated genes encoding odorant (ORs), gustatory, and ionotropic receptors and chemosensory soluble proteins and odorant-binding proteins in transcriptomes of chemosensory tissues of the above three species and in early draft genomes of two species, A. compressa and C. arenaria. Our analyses revealed that apoid wasps possess larger OR repertoires than any bee lineage, that the last common ancestor of Apoidea possessed a considerably larger OR repertoire (∼160) than previously estimated (73), and that the expansion of OR genes in eusocial bees was less extensive than previously assumed. Intriguingly, the evolution of pollen-collecting behavior in the stem lineage of bees was associated with a notable loss of OR gene diversity. Thus, our results support the view that herbivorous Hymenoptera tend to possess smaller OR repertoires than carnivorous, parasitoid, or kleptoparasitic species.",
  "Queen pheromones are chemical signals that mediate reproductive division of labor in eusocial animals. Remarkably, queen pheromones are composed of identical or chemically similar compounds in some ants, wasps and bees, even though these taxa diverged >150MYA and evolved queens and workers independently. Here, we measure the transcriptomic consequences of experimental exposure to queen pheromones in workers from two ant and two bee species (genera: Lasius, Apis, Bombus), and test whether they are similar across species. Queen pheromone exposure affected transcription and splicing at many loci. Many genes responded consistently in multiple species, and the set of pheromone-sensitive genes was enriched for functions relating to lipid biosynthesis and transport, olfaction, production of cuticle, oogenesis, and histone (de)acetylation. Pheromone-sensitive genes tend to be evolutionarily ancient, positively selected, peripheral in the gene coexpression network, hypomethylated, and caste-specific in their expression. Our results reveal how queen pheromones achieve their effects, and suggest that ants and bees use similar genetic modules to achieve reproductive division of labor.",
  "In the course of evolution, eusociality has appeared several times independently in Hymenoptera, within different families such as Apidae (bees), Formicidae (ants), and Vespidae (wasps and hornets), among others. The complex social organization of eusocial Hymenoptera relies on sophisticated olfactory communication systems. Whereas the olfactory systems of several bee and ant species have been well characterized, very little information is as yet available in Vespidae, although this family represents a highly successful insect group, displaying a wide range of life styles from solitary to eusocial. Using fluorescent labeling, confocal microscopy, and 3D reconstructions, we investigated the organization of the olfactory pathway in queens, workers, and males of the eusocial hornet Vespa velutina. First, we found that caste and sex dimorphism is weakly pronounced in hornets, with regard to both whole-brain morphology and antennal lobe organization, although several male-specific macroglomeruli are present. The V. velutina antennal lobe contains approximately 265 glomeruli (in females), grouped in nine conspicuous clusters formed by afferent tract subdivisions. As in bees and ants, hornets display a dual olfactory pathway, with two major efferent tracts, the medial and the lateral antennal lobe tracts (m- and l-ALT), separately arborizing two antennal lobe hemilobes and projecting to partially different regions of higher order olfactory centers. Finally, we found remarkable anatomical similarities in the glomerular cluster organizations among hornets, ants, and bees, suggesting the possible existence of homologies in the olfactory pathways of these eusocial Hymenoptera. We propose a common framework for describing AL compartmentalization across Hymenoptera and discuss possible evolutionary scenarios. J. Comp.

  "Insects have been used as an exemplary model in studying longevity, from extrinsic mortality pressures to intrinsic senescence. In the highly eusocial insects, great degrees of variation in lifespan exist between morphological castes in relation to extreme divisions of labour, but of particular interest are the primitively eusocial insects. These species represent the ancestral beginnings of eusociality, in which castes are flexible and based on behaviour rather than morphology. Here we present data on the longevity of the primitively eusocial Neotropical paper wasp P. canadensis, in a captive setting removed of environmental hazards. Captive Polistes canadensis had an average lifespan of 193 ± 10.5 days; although this average is shorter than most bee and ant queens, one individual lived for 506 days in the lab-longer than most recorded wasps and bees. Natal colony variation in longevity does exist between P. canadensis colonies, possibly due to nutritional and genetic factors. This study provides a foundation for future investigations on the effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on longevity in primitively eusocial insects, as well as the relationship with natal group and cohort size.",
  "Highly eusocial insect workers exhibit age-related division of labor. Adults begin working inside the nest, moving to the nest periphery and later to foraging. Passage through this task sequence is associated with neuroanatomical changes in the mushroom bodies (MB) of honey bee (Apis) and ant (Camponotus) workers. We asked whether eusocial wasp workers (Polybia aequatorialis) exhibit similar changes in adult neuroanatomy. Wasps were identified as working in-nest, on-nest, or foraging. The volumes of the somata of workers' MB intrinsic neurons (Kenyon cells), and of the neuropils containing the Kenyon cell dendritic arbors (calyces), were estimated using stereological methods. In-nest workers had significantly smaller calyx to Kenyon cell volume ratios than on-nest and foraging workers. Age-related task specializations in Polybia workers are associated with major neuroanatomical reorganization in the mushroom bodies.",
  "Studies on the role of juvenile hormone (JH) in adult social Hymenoptera have focused on the regulation of two fundamental aspects of colony organization: reproductive division of labor between queens and workers and age-related division of labor among workers. JH acts as a gonadotropin in the primitively eusocial wasp and bumble bee species studied, and may also play this role in the advanced eusocial fire ants. However, there is no evidence that JH acts as a traditional gonadotropin in the advanced eusocial honey bee or in the few other ant species that have recently begun to be studied. The role of JH in age-related division of labor has been most thoroughly examined in honey bees. Results of these studies demonstrate that JH acts as a \"behavioral pacemaker,\" influencing how fast a worker grows up and makes the transition from nest activities to foraging. Hypotheses concerning the evolutionary relationship between the two functions of JH in adult eusocial Hymenoptera are discussed.",
  "The seminal discovery that in adults of the highly social honey bee (Apis mellifera), juvenile hormone (JH) regulates age-related division of labor (DoL) but not adult fertility, unlike in most insects, has led to the hypothesis that the evolution of insect sociality involved modifications in JH signaling. Recent studies examining JH functions across the Hymenoptera provide two main insights: First, significant progress in studies of the bumble bee Bombus terrestris, which exhibits an intermediate level of social complexity relative to honey bees, shows that JH regulates multiple tissues involved in reproduction, but not task performance. JH also seems to function as a primary gonadotropin in bees showing solitary lifestyles or low levels of social complexity, highlighting a marked contrast with its roles in honey bees. Second, this association between JH function and social complexity in bees does not generalize to other lineages. The few studies on JH function in highly social stingless bees are not consistent with the honey bee model. In wasps and hornets, JH typically influences both fertility and age-related DoL. There is substantial variability across ant species, offering no consistent model linking JH function to social complexity. We propose that although JH signaling is commonly modified in social insects, the specific changes differ between - and sometimes within - lineages. There is no one model linking JH function to social complexity across major lineages, likely due to changes in related pathways. These modifications enable social insects to circumvent the trade-off between reproduction and maintenance.",
  "Teamwork is often assumed to enhance group performance, particularly for physical tasks. However, in both human and non-human animal teams, the effort contributed by each member may, in fact, decrease as team size grows. This counterintuitive phenomenon, known as the Ringelmann effect,1 is generally ascribed to poor coordination or differences in motivation.2,3 Weaver ants (Oecophylla smaragdina) display some of the most impressive feats of teamwork in the natural world,4,5 including self-assembly into pulling teams that fold leaves into nesting chambers.6,7 Here, we investigated whether weaver ant pulling teams suffer from the Ringelmann effect by measuring the force that weaver ant teams of varying sizes produce during nest construction. The average force contribution per individual almost doubled as team size increased, demonstrating that weaver ants not only avoid the Ringelmann effect but achieve the opposite-they are \"superefficient\" team workers.8,9,10 We propose that this superefficiency is facilitated by a division of labor within teams: \"active pullers\" work together to generate a pulling force that is stored in chains of \"passive resisters,\" which capitalize on the remarkable frictional strength of weaver ant attachment organs; weaver ant teams thereby act as a \"force ratchet.\" Our results highlight a novel mechanism of teamwork in a highly coordinated natural system and may inspire optimization algorithms for superefficient teams in distributed artificial systems, including swarm robotics. VIDEO ABSTRACT.",
  "Social insects offer powerful models to investigate mechanisms of elaborate individual behaviors comprising a cooperative community. Workers of the leafcutter ant genus Atta are extreme examples of behavioral segregation among phenotypically distinct worker types. We utilize this worker system to test the molecular underpinnings of behavioral programming and the extent of plasticity to reprogramming. We identify specific neuropeptides mediating worker division of labor in A. cephalotes, finding two neuropeptides associated with characteristic behaviors of leaf cutting and of brood care. Genetic knockdown or injection of these neuropeptides led to a stark gain or loss of each behavior and to transcriptomic shifts toward gene pathways expressed in the natural castes. We also reveal global similarities between worker transcriptomes of the eusocial mammal, the naked mole-rat H. glaber, with orthologous A. cephalotes workers. This work underscores the essential function of neuropeptides in establishing complex social behavior and a remarkable plasticity among individual behavioral types.",
  "An important advantage to sociality is division of labour, which is often associated with specialization of group members, such as the polymorphic subcastes of ant workers. Given this advantage, it is puzzling that many social groups do not show clear specialization. Among ants, workers of closely related species have one, two or even three polymorphisms. The degree of specialism of asocial animals depends on environmental variability because specialists will perform poorly in some conditions. Here, we use a numeric model to consider whether the magnitude and type of environmental variability can help to explain the diversity of specialism in cooperative groups. By finding the optimal distribution of group members along a single dimension of specialization for two tasks, we predict when groups should be composed of specialists, generalists, both of these (trimodal) or moderate specialists. Generalism is predicted more when environments are unstable and when task importance-rather than demand-varies but depends on the likelihood that the group can complete all tasks in the range of experienced conditions. The benefit of sociality is strongest in invariable environments and there is selection for redundancy in the workforce, which may explain the widely observed inactivity in social insects.This article is part of the theme issue 'Division of labour as key driver of social evolution'.",
  "The ecological success of social insects makes their colony organization fascinating to scientists studying collective systems. In recent years, the combination of automated behavioural tracking and social network analysis has deepened our understanding of many aspects of colony organization. However, because studies have typically worked with single species, we know little about interspecific variation in network structure. Here, we conduct a comparative network analysis across five ant species from five subfamilies, separated by more than 100 Myr of evolution. We find that social network structure is highly conserved across subfamilies. All species studied form modular networks, with two social communities, a similar distribution of individuals between the two communities, and equivalent mapping of task performance onto the communities. Against this backdrop of organizational similarity, queens of the different species occupied qualitatively distinct network positions. The deep conservation of the two community structure implies that the most fundamental behavioural division of labour in social insects is between workers that stay in the nest to rear brood, and those that leave the nest to forage. This division has parallels across the animal kingdom in systems of biparental care and probably represents the most readily evolvable form of behavioural division of labour.",
  "While the neural basis of age-related decline has been extensively studied,1,2,3 less is known about changes in neural function during the pre-senescent stages of adulthood. Adult neural plasticity is likely a key factor in social insect age polyethism, where individuals perform different tasks as they age and divide labor in an age-dependent manner.4,5,6,7,8,9 Primarily, workers transition from nursing to foraging tasks,5,10 become more aggressive, and more readily display alarm behavior11,12,13,14,15,16 as they get older. While it is unknown how these behavioral dynamics are neurally regulated, they could partially be generated by altered salience of behaviorally relevant stimuli.4,6,7 Here, we investigated how odor coding in the antennal lobe (AL) changes with age in the context of alarm pheromone communication in the clonal raider ant (Ooceraea biroi).17 Similar to other social insects,11,12,16 older ants responded more rapidly to alarm pheromones, the chemical signals for danger. Using whole-AL calcium imaging,18 we then mapped odor representations for five general odorants and two alarm pheromones in young and old ants. Alarm pheromones were represented sparsely at all ages. However, alarm pheromone responses within individual glomeruli changed with age, either increasing or decreasing. Only two glomeruli became sensitized to alarm pheromones with age, while at the same time becoming desensitized to general odorants. Our results suggest that the heightened response to alarm pheromones in older ants occurs via increased sensitivity in these two core glomeruli, illustrating the importance of sensory modulation in social insect division of labor and age-associated behavioral plasticity.",
  "Ant physiology has been fashioned by 100 million years of social evolution. Ants perform many sophisticated social and collective behaviors yet possess nervous systems similar in schematic and scale to that of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, a popular solitary model organism. Ants are thus attractive complementary subjects to investigate adaptations pertaining to complex social behaviors that are absent in flies. Despite research interest in ant behavior and the neurobiological foundations of sociality more broadly, our understanding of the ant nervous system is incomplete. Recent technical advances have enabled cutting-edge investigations of the nervous system in a fashion that is less dependent on model choice, opening the door for mechanistic social insect neuroscience. In this review, we revisit important aspects of what is known about the ant nervous system and behavior, and we look forward to how functional circuit neuroscience in ants will help us understand what distinguishes solitary animals from highly social ones.",
  "Division of labour is widely thought to increase the task efficiency of eusocial insects. Workers can switch their task to compensate for sudden changes in demand, providing flexible task allocation. In combination with automated tracking technology, we developed a robotic system to precisely control and spatiotemporally manipulate floor temperature over days, which allowed us to predictably drive brood transport behaviour in colonies of the ant Camponotus floridanus. Our results indicate that a small number of workers, usually minors belonging to the nurse social group, are highly specialised for brood transport. There was no difference in the speed at which workers transported brood, suggesting that specialisation does not correlate with efficiency. Workers often started to transport the brood only after having identified a better location. There was no evidence that workers shared information about the presence of a better location. Notably, once brood transporters had been removed, none of the remaining workers performed this task, and the brood transport completely stopped. When brood transporters were returned to their colony, brood transport was immediately restored. Taken together, our study reveals that brood transport is an inflexible task, achieved through the synchronous actions of a few privately informed specialist workers.",
  "The division of labor among workers is a defining characteristic of social insects and plays a pivotal role in enhancing the competitive advantage of their colony. Juvenile hormone (JH) has long been hypothesized to be the essential driver in regulating the division of labor due to its ability to accelerate behavioral transitions in social insects, such as honeybees. The regulation of behavioral transitions by JH in the red imported fire ant (RIFA), Solenopsis invicta, a typical social pest, is unclear. Through video capture and analysis, we investigated the effects of the juvenile hormone analogue (JHA) methoprene on brood care, phototaxis behavior, and threat responsiveness of RIFA nurse workers. Our results showed that the JHA application significantly reduced the time and frequency of brood care behavior by nurse workers while increasing their walking distance and activity time in the light area. Additionally, the application of JHA made ants become excited, indicating a significant improvement in their activity level (movement distance, time, and speed). Furthermore, it was observed that the application of JHA did not affect the threat responsiveness of nurse workers towards stimuli (nestmates or non-nestmates). Our study demonstrates that the application of JHA reduced brood care behavior and enhanced phototaxis in nurse workers, which may reveal the role of JH in facilitating behavioral transitions in RIFA from intranidal tasks to extranidal activity. This study provides an experimental basis for further elucidating the mechanism underlying the division of labor in social insects.",
  "Division of labor is a hallmark characteristic of social insect colonies. While it is understood that worker differentiation is regulated through either the queen or her brood, the understanding of the physiology behind task regulation varies within social species. Studies in eusocial insects have shown that juvenile hormone (JH) is associated with division of labor and the onset of foraging tasks. Although, outside of a few key species, this interaction has yet to be elucidated in the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta. In this study, we evaluated the role of a JH analog, S-hydroprene in worker task transition in Solenopsis invicta. S-hydroprene was applied to nurses to observe behavioral changes. S-hyroprene application to nurses did not affect phototaxis, but there was a shift in behavior from internal, nest-based behaviors to external, foraging-based behaviors. These results show that JH may be implicated in worker task transition in S. invicta and may function similarly as it does in other eusocial insects.",
  "In social groups, infection risk is not distributed evenly across individuals. Individual behaviour is a key source of variation in infection risk, yet its effects are difficult to separate from other factors (e.g., age). Here, we combine epidemiological experiments with chemical, transcriptomic, and automated behavioural analyses in clonal ant colonies, where behavioural individuality emerges among identical workers. We find that: (1) Caenorhabditis-related nematodes parasitise ant heads and affect their survival and physiology, (2) differences in infection emerge from behavioural variation alone, and reflect spatially-organised division of labour, (3) infections affect colony social organisation by causing infected workers to stay in the nest. By disproportionately infecting some workers and shifting their spatial distribution, infections reduce division of labour and increase spatial overlap between hosts, which should facilitate parasite transmission. Thus, division of labour, a defining feature of societies, not only shapes infection risk and distribution but is also modulated by parasites.",
  "Eusocial insects exemplify a remarkable system of division of labor within the same colony. This behavioral range, which is sometimes accompanied by morphological or physiological differences, provides an opportunity to study the relationship between complex behaviors and their underlying molecular mechanisms. This is especially true in ants because certain genera have an elaborate caste system and can dramatically change their stereotypical behavior over their lifetime. Recent studies experimentally alter ant behavior over short times, thus opening the study of underlying plasticity pathways. The molecular underpinnings of these behaviors are neuromodulators as well as the regulation of chromatin. Here, we concisely review the current understanding of the relationship between neuromodulators, epigenetics, and social behavior in ants. We discuss future directions in light of experimental limitations of the ant system.",
  "Eusocial insects are characterized by several traits, including reproductive division of labor and caste polymorphisms, which likely modulate genome evolution. Concomitantly, evolution may act on specific genes and pathways underlying these novel, sociality-associated phenotypes. Reproductive division of labor should increase the magnitude of genetic drift and reduce the efficacy of selection by reducing effective population size. Caste polymorphism has been associated with relaxed selection and may facilitate directional selection on caste-specific genes. Here, we use comparative analyses of 22 ant genomes to test how reproductive division of labor and worker polymorphism influence positive selection and selection intensity across the genome. Our results demonstrate that worker reproductive capacity is associated with a reduction in the degree of relaxed selection but is not associated with any significant change to positive selection. We find decreases in positive selection in species with polymorphic workers, but no increase in the degree of relaxed selection. Finally, we explore evolutionary patterns in specific candidate genes associated with our focal traits in eusocial insects. Two oocyte patterning genes previously implicated in worker sterility evolve under intensified selection in species with reproductive workers. Behavioral caste genes generally experience relaxed selection associated with worker polymorphism, whereas vestigial and spalt, both associated with soldier development in Pheidole ants, experience intensified selection in worker polymorphic species. These findings expand our understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying elaborations of sociality. The impacts of reproductive division of labor and caste polymorphisms on specific genes illuminate those genes' roles in generating complex eusocial phenotypes.",
  "Concerted developmental programming may constrain changes in component structures of the brain, thus limiting the ability of selection to form an adaptive mosaic of size-variable brain compartments independent of total brain size or body size. Measuring patterns of gene expression underpinning brain scaling in conjunction with anatomical brain atlases can aid in identifying influences of concerted and/or mosaic evolution. Species exhibiting exceptional size and behavioral polyphenisms provide excellent systems to test predictions of brain evolution models by quantifying brain gene expression. We examined patterns of brain gene expression in a remarkably polymorphic and behaviorally complex social insect, the leafcutter ant Atta cephalotes. The majority of significant differential gene expression observed among three morphologically, behaviorally, and neuroanatomically differentiated worker size groups was attributable to body size. However, we also found evidence of differential brain gene expression unexplained by worker morphological variation and transcriptomic analysis identified patterns not linearly correlated with worker size but sometimes mirroring neuropil scaling. Additionally, we identified enriched gene ontology terms associated with nucleic acid regulation, metabolism, neurotransmission, and sensory perception, further supporting a relationship between brain gene expression, brain mosaicism, and worker labor role. These findings demonstrate that differential brain gene expression among polymorphic workers underpins behavioral and neuroanatomical differentiation associated with complex agrarian division of labor in A. cephalotes.",
  "Among social insects, task allocation within its group members remains as one of the paramount pillars of social functionality. Division of labor in many eusocial insects is maintained by behavioral flexibility that can shift according to the needs of the colony they reside in. Workers typically, over time as they age, shift from intranidal nurses to extranidal foragers. If the needs of the colony change, either from the needs of the adults or the brood therein, workers shift their behavior in order to compensate for the need of a particular task to be done. This shift, either accelerating towards a behavior associated with an older worker, or regressing back into the nest, is not clearly understood in social insects outside of honeybees. In this study, evaluated how brood type affected the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta, worker task reversion and acceleration. Through observation of worker behaviors performed over multiple time-points per day, we discovered that worker task reversion and acceleration does occur within this ant species. Furthermore, the type of brood influenced the rate at which this occurred, with larvae having the strongest effect of all types. Finally, there was a propensity for workers to maintain their new behavior throughout the experiment. This study shows that the needs of brood within a social insect colony can influence the behavior workers perform, reversing the age polyethism that is common among social insect species.",
  "Social insects owe their widespread success to their ability to efficiently coordinate behaviour to carry out complex tasks. Several leaf-cutter ant species employ an advanced type of division of labour known as task partitioning, where the task of retrieving leaves is distributed between workers that cut and drop and those that collect the fallen leaves. It is not entirely clear how such highly coordinated behaviour can evolve, as it would seem to require the simultaneous mutations of multiple traits during the same generation. Here, we use an agent-based simulation model to show how task partitioning in leaf-cutter ants can gradually evolve by exploiting stigmergy (indirect coordination through the environment) through gravity (leaves falling from the treetop on the ground forming a cache). Our simple model allows independent variation in two core behavioural dimensions: the tendency to drop leaves and the tendency to pick up dropped leaves. Task partitioning readily evolves even under these minimal assumptions through adaptation to an arboreal environment where traveling up and down the tree is costly. Additionally, we analyse ant movement dynamics to demonstrate how the ants achieve efficient task allocation through task switching and negative feedback control.",
  "The ecological success of social Hymenoptera (ants, bees, wasps) depends on the division of labour between the queen and workers. Each caste exhibits highly specialized morphology, behaviour, and life-history traits, such as lifespan and fecundity. Despite strong defences against alien intruders, insect societies are vulnerable to social parasites, such as workerless inquilines or slave-making ants. Here, we investigate whether gene expression varies in parallel ways between lifestyles (slave-making versus host ants) across five independent origins of ant slavery in the \"Formicoxenus-group\" of the ant tribe Crematogastrini. As caste differences are often less pronounced in slave-making ants than in nonparasitic ants, we also compare caste-specific gene expression patterns between lifestyles. We demonstrate a substantial overlap in expression differences between queens and workers across taxa, irrespective of lifestyle. Caste affects the transcriptomes much more profoundly than lifestyle, as indicated by 37 times more genes being linked to caste than to lifestyle and by multiple caste-associated modules of coexpressed genes with strong connectivity. However, several genes and one gene module are linked to slave-making across the independent origins of this parasitic lifestyle, pointing to some evolutionary convergence. Finally, we do not find evidence for an interaction between caste and lifestyle, indicating that caste differences in gene expression remain consistent even when species switch to a parasitic lifestyle. Our findings strongly support the existence of a core set of genes whose expression is linked to the queen and worker caste in this ant taxon, as proposed by the \"genetic toolkit\" hypothesis.",
  "Selection may favour traits throughout an individual's lifetime or at a particular life stage. In many species of social insects, established colonies that are more genetically diverse outperform less diverse colonies with respect to a variety of traits that contribute to fitness, but whether selection favours high diversity in small colonies is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that selection favours genetically diverse colonies during the juvenile period using a multi-year field experiment with the harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex occidentalis. We used controlled matings to generate colonies that varied in genetic diversity and transplanted them into the field. We monitored their survival for seven (the 2015 cohort, n = 149) and six (the 2016 cohort, n = 157) years. Genetically more diverse colonies had greater survival, resulting in significant viability selection. However, in both cohorts survival was not influenced by genetic diversity until colonies were three years old. We suggest that changes in their internal organization enabled colonies to use the benefits of multiple genotypes, and discuss possible mechanisms that can generate this pattern.",
  "The evolution of eusociality has allowed ants to become one of the most conspicuous and ecologically dominant groups of organisms in the world. A large majority of the current ∼14,000 ant species belong to the formicoids,1 a clade of nine subfamilies that exhibit the most extreme forms of reproductive division of labor, large colony size,2 worker polymorphism,3 and extended queen longevity.4 The eight remaining non-formicoid subfamilies are less well studied, with few genomes having been sequenced so far and unclear phylogenetic relationships.5 By sequencing 65 genomes, we provide a robust phylogeny of the 17 ant subfamilies, retrieving high support to the controversial leptanillomorph clade (Leptanillinae and Martialinae) as the sister group to all other extant ants. Moreover, our genomic analyses revealed that the emergence of the formicoids was accompanied by an elevated number of positive selection events. Importantly, the top three gene functions under selection are linked to key features of complex eusociality, with histone acetylation being implicated in caste differentiation, gene silencing by RNA in worker sterility, and autophagy in longevity. These results show that the key pathways associated with eusociality have been under strong selection during the Cretaceous, suggesting that the molecular foundations of complex eusociality may have evolved rapidly in less than 20 Ma.",
  "BACKGROUND: Worker division of labor is predominant in social insects. The foraging (for) gene, which encodes cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG), has been implicated in the regulation of behavioral transitions in honeybees, but information regarding its function in other social insects is scarce. RESULTS: We investigated the role of the for (Sifor) gene in the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta, and found that Sifor and PKG exhibited different expression patterns in different castes, body sizes, ages and tissues of fire ants, especially in foragers and nurses. Foragers displayed greater locomotor activity but showed no preference for larval or adult odors, whereas nurses showed lesser locomotor activity but had a strong preference for larval odors. We found that the expression of Sifor was significantly higher in the heads of foragers (compared to nurses). RNA interference-mediated Sifor knockdown in foraging workers induced behavioral transition of foragers toward the nurse phenotype characterized by reduced locomotor activity and a stronger preference for larval odors. By contrast, treating nurses with 8-Br-cGMP, an activator of PKG, resulted in behavioral transition toward the forager phenotype characterized by higher locomotor activity but reduced preference for larval odors. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that Sifor plays a critical role in the behavioral transition between foragers and nurses of workers, which may be a promising target for RNAi-based management of worker caste organization in S. invicta. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.",
  "Reproductive division of labor in the social insects is typically determined by environmental cues; however, genetic effects on caste have been discovered in a growing set of ant taxa. An extreme form of genetic caste determination is \"social hybridogenesis,\" in which co-occurring genetic lineages obligately interbreed to produce workers, whereas daughter queens are of pure-lineage ancestry. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that social hybridogenesis in the genus Pogonomyrmex resulted from one or more interspecific hybridization events, and if so, whether individual lineages were of hybrid ancestry. We reconstructed evolutionary relationships of four lineage pairs to populations of two closely related non-hybridogenetic species, Pogonomyrmex barbatus and Pogonomyrmex rugosus, using nuclear SNP loci and mitochondrial sequencing. The nuclear phylogeny supported a hybridization hypothesis, with one member of each pair nested within P. rugosus, whereas the other was nested within P. barbatus. The source populations corresponded with two distinct geographic areas at the eastern and western edges of a zone of contact. Relatively little gene flow was detected between interbreeding lineages, either historically or currently. This suggests that shifts in reproductive caste determination may reinforce reproductive incompatibility, in a manner similar to the evolution of hybridogenesis in nonsocial systems.",
  "Ants are highly diverse social insects living in colonies consisted of up to millions of individuals with reproductive division of labors. Due to the interests in disclosing the genetic and epigenetic regulation mechanisms underlying the distinct developmental trajectories between castes and division of labor in colonies, many ant species have recently been established as laboratory models for evolutionary development and social behavior studies. These functional studies often request a precise quantification of the relative gene expression level, which relies on a stably expressed reference genes for normalization. A core set of reliable reference genes for this purpose however has not been established yet in ants. In the present study, we tested the expression patterns and amplification efficiencies of 12 abundantly expressed candidate genes in Monomorium pharaonis, one of the few ant species that are suitable for laboratory rearing and experimentation. We quantified the expression levels of these genes by RT-qPCR in seven different conditions: embryo development, sexual development, worker development, adult phenotypes, tissues, and two abiotic manipulative treatments in pharaoh ant. Finally, five genes, elongation factor-1 alpha (EF1A), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), TATA-box-binding protein (TATA), tubulin gamma-2 chain-like (TBLg2), heat shock protein 67B2-like (HSP67) were found to be the most stable reference genes across seven conditions. We also identified the most stable reference genes applicable for each distinct condition and the optimal number of reference genes entailed were evaluated. Our study validates reliable reference genes for RT-qPCR analysis which lays the foundation for future studies in pharaoh ant.",
  "In a species of Mediterranean desert-dwelling ant, Cataglyphis piliscapa (formerly, C. cursor), some individuals, mostly foragers, engage in highly orchestrated behavior to free a trapped nestmate. Their behavior, which we have labeled rescue, is a heritable trait in this species, and it appears fully formed within a few days of an ant's emergence as an adult. Not only is the rescue behavior by these ant specialists precisely targeted, but also it involves a complex, dynamic sequence of behavioral patterns. That is, each rescue operation is responsive both to the specific circumstances of the nestmate's entrapment and to the way in which that particular rescue operation unfolds, relying on the rescuer's short-term memory of its previous actions to increase efficiency and to decrease energy expenditure. Rescue appears in several other ant species as well, and, although the specific behavioral patterns and contexts vary across species, the outcome-namely, releasing a distressed nestmate-remains the same. Here, we describe research designed to address questions about the function, evolution, cause, and development of rescue behavior in C. piliscapa-a behavior ecological approach-drawing on research in other species, and by other researchers, both to highlight comparative similarities and differences and, importantly, to draw attention to still unanswered questions. In addition, by shedding light on the rescue behavior of ants, we also hope to engender increased attention to, and research on, this extraordinary form of helping behavior in multiple other taxa.",
  "Brain evolution is hypothesized to be driven by behavioral selection on neuroarchitecture. We developed a novel metric of relative neuroanatomical investments involved in performing tasks varying in sensorimotor and processing demands across polymorphic task-specialized workers of the leafcutter ant Atta cephalotes and quantified brain size and structure to examine their correlation with our computational approximations. Investment in multisensory and motor integration for task performance was estimated to be greatest for media workers, whose highly diverse repertoire includes leaf-quality discrimination and leaf-harvesting tasks that likely involve demanding sensory and motor processes. Confocal imaging revealed that absolute brain volume increased with worker size and functionally specialized compartmental scaling differed among workers. The mushroom bodies, centers of sensory integration and learning and memory, and the antennal lobes, olfactory input sites, were larger in medias than in minims (gardeners) and significantly larger than in majors (\"soldiers\"), both of which had lower scores for involvement of olfactory processing in the performance of their characteristic tasks. Minims had a proportionally larger central complex compared to other workers. These results support the hypothesis that variation in task performance influences selection for mosaic brain structure, the independent evolution of proportions of the brain composed of different neuropils.",
  "BACKGROUND: Circadian clocks allow organisms to anticipate daily fluctuations in their environment by driving rhythms in physiology and behavior. Inter-organismal differences in daily rhythms, called chronotypes, exist and can shift with age. In ants, age, caste-related behavior and chronotype appear to be linked. Brood-tending nurse ants are usually younger individuals and show \"around-the-clock\" activity. With age or in the absence of brood, nurses transition into foraging ants that show daily rhythms in activity. Ants can adaptively shift between these behavioral castes and caste-associated chronotypes depending on social context. We investigated how changes in daily gene expression could be contributing to such behavioral plasticity in Camponotus floridanus carpenter ants by combining time-course behavioral assays and RNA-Sequencing of forager and nurse brains. RESULTS: We found that nurse brains have three times fewer 24 h oscillating genes than foragers. However, several hundred genes that oscillated every 24 h in forager brains showed robust 8 h oscillations in nurses, including the core clock genes Period and Shaggy. These differentially rhythmic genes consisted of several components of the circadian entrainment and output pathway, including genes said to be involved in regulating insect locomotory behavior. We also found that Vitellogenin, known to regulate division of labor in social insects, showed robust 24 h oscillations in nurse brains but not in foragers. Finally, we found significant overlap between genes differentially expressed between the two ant castes and genes that show ultradian rhythms in daily expression. CONCLUSION: This study provides a first look at the chronobiological differences in gene expression between forager and nurse ant brains. This endeavor allowed us to identify a putative molecular mechanism underlying plastic timekeeping: several components of the ant circadian clock and its output can seemingly oscillate at different harmonics of the circadian rhythm. We propose that such chronobiological plasticity has evolved to allow for distinct regulatory networks that underlie behavioral castes, while supporting swift caste transitions in response to colony demands. Behavioral division of labor is common among social insects. The links between chronobiological and behavioral plasticity that we found in C. floridanus, thus, likely represent a more general phenomenon that warrants further investigation.",
  "The social organization of many primate, bird and rodent species and the role of individuals within that organization are associated with specific individual physiological traits. However, this association is perhaps most pronounced in eusocial insects (e.g., termites, ants). In such species, genetically close individuals show significant differences in behavior, physiology, and life expectancy. Studies addressing the metabolic changes according to the social role are still lacking. We aimed at understanding how sociality could influence essential molecular processes in a eusocial insect, the black garden ant (Lasius niger) where queens can live up to ten times longer than workers. Using mass spectrometry-based analysis, we explored the whole metabolome of queens, nest-workers and foraging workers. A former proteomics study done in the same species allowed us to compare the findings of both approaches. Confirming the former results at the proteome level, we showed that queens had fewer metabolites related to immunity. Contrary to our predictions, we did not find any metabolite linked to reproduction in queens. Among the workers, foragers had a metabolic signature reflecting a more stressful environment and a more highly stimulated immune system. We also found that nest-workers had more digestion-related metabolites. Hence, we showed that specific metabolic signatures match specific social roles. Besides, we identified metabolites differently expressed among behavioral castes and involved in nutrient sensing and longevity pathways (e.g., sirtuins, FOXO). The links between such molecular pathways and aging being found in an increasing number of taxa, our results confirm and strengthen their potential universality.",
  "Previous research in our laboratories has demonstrated that, within each colony of Cataglyphis piliscapa (formerly C. cursor) ants, only some individuals are capable of performing a complex sequence of behavioral patterns to free trapped nestmates-a sequence that not only is memory-dependent but also is responsive to the particular circumstances of that entrapment and how the rescue operation unfolds. Additionally, this rescue behavior is inherited patrilineally from but a few of the many males that fertilize the eggs of the colony's single queen. Here, we describe three experiments to explore rescue behavior further-namely, whether rescuers are in any way selective about which nestmates they help, how the age of rescuers and the victims that they help affect the quantity and quality of the rescue operation, and when this complex behavior first emerges in an ant's development. Taken together with the previous heritability analysis, these behavioral experiments provide clear evidence that the ability to rescue nestmates in distress should be recognized as a specialization, which together with other specialized tasks in C. piliscapa, contributes to a division of labor that increases the efficiency of the colony as a whole and, thus increases its reproductive success.",
  "In cooperative systems exhibiting division of labor, such as microbial communities, multicellular organisms, and social insect colonies, individual units share costs and benefits through both task specialization and exchanged materials. Socially exchanged fluids, like seminal fluid and milk, allow individuals to molecularly influence conspecifics. Many social insects have a social circulatory system, where food and endogenously produced molecules are transferred mouth-to-mouth (stomodeal trophallaxis), connecting all the individuals in the society. To understand how these endogenous molecules relate to colony life, we used quantitative proteomics to investigate the trophallactic fluid within colonies of the carpenter ant Camponotus floridanus. We show that different stages of the colony life cycle circulate different types of proteins: young colonies prioritize direct carbohydrate processing; mature colonies prioritize accumulation and transmission of stored resources. Further, colonies circulate proteins implicated in oxidative stress, ageing, and social insect caste determination, potentially acting as superorganismal hormones. Brood-caring individuals that are also closer to the queen in the social network (nurses) showed higher abundance of oxidative stress-related proteins. Thus, trophallaxis behavior could provide a mechanism for distributed metabolism in social insect societies. The ability to thoroughly analyze the materials exchanged between cooperative units makes social insect colonies useful models to understand the evolution and consequences of metabolic division of labor at other scales. Division of labor is essential for cooperation, because groups can achieve more when individuals specialize in different tasks. This happens across the natural world, from different cells in organisms performing specific roles, to the individuals in an ant colony carrying out diverse duties. In both of these systems, individuals work together to ensure the survival of the collective unit – the body or the colony – instead of competing against each other. One of the main ways division of labor is evident within these two systems is regarding reproduction. Both in the body and in an ant colony, only one or a few individual units can reproduce, while the rest provide support. In the case of ant colonies, only queens and males reproduce, while the young workers nurse the brood and older workers forage for food. This intense cooperation requires close communication between individual units – in the case of some species of ants, by sharing fluids mouth-to-mouth. These fluids contain food but also many molecules produced by the ants themselves, including proteins. Given that both individuals and the colony as a whole change as they age – with workers acquiring new roles, and new queens and males only reared once the colony is mature – it is likely that the proteins transmitted in the fluid also change. To better understand whether the lifecycles of individuals and the age of the colony affect the fluids shared by carpenter ants Camponotus floridanus, Hakala et al. examined the ant-produced proteins in these fluids. This revealed differences in the proteins shared by young and mature colonies, and young nurse ants and older forager ants. In young colonies, the fluids contained proteins involved in fast sugar processing; while in mature colonies, the fluids contained more proteins to store nutrients, which help insect larvae grow into larger individuals, like queens. Young worker ants, who spend their time nursing the brood, produced more anti-aging proteins. This may be because these ants are in close contact with the queen, who lives much longer than the rest of the ants in the colony. Taken together, these observations suggest that ants divide the labor of metabolism, as well as work and reproduction. Dividing the labor of metabolism among individuals is one more similarity between ants and the cells of a multicellular organism, like a fly or a human. Division of labor allows the sharing of burden, with some individuals lightening the load of others. Understanding how ants achieve this by sharing fluids could shed new light on this complex exchange at other scales or in other organisms. By matching proteins to life stages, researchers have a starting point to examine individual molecules in more detail.",
  "BACKGROUND: The reproductive division of labor of eusocial insects, whereby one or several queens monopolize reproduction, evolved in a context of high genetic relatedness. However, many extant eusocial species have developed strategies that decrease genetic relatedness in their colonies, suggesting some benefits of the increased diversity. Multiple studies support this hypothesis by showing positive correlations between genetic diversity and colony fitness, as well as finding effects of experimental manipulations of diversity on colony performance. However, alternative explanations could account for most of these reports, and the benefits of diversity on performance in eusocial insects still await validation. In this study, we experimentally increased worker diversity in small colonies of the ant Lasius niger while controlling for typical confounding factors. RESULTS: We found that experimental colonies composed of workers coming from three different source colonies produced more larvae and showed more variation in size compared to groups of workers coming from a single colony. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that the benefits of increased diversity stemmed from an improved division of labor. Our study confirms that worker diversity enhances colony performance, thus providing a possible explanation for the evolution of multiply mated queens and multiple-queen colonies in many species of eusocial insects.",
  "Worker division of labor is a defining trait in social insects. Many species are characterized by having behavioral flexibility where workers perform non-typical tasks for their age depending on the colony's needs. Worker division of labor and behavioral flexibility were examined in the little fire ant Wasmannia auropunctata (Roger, 1863), for which age-related division of labor has been found. Young workers perform nursing duties which include tending of brood and queens, and colony defense, while older workers forage. When nurses were experimentally removed from the colony, foragers were observed carrying out nursing and colony defense duties, yet when foragers were removed nurses did not forage precociously. We also administered juvenile hormone analog, methoprene, to workers. When methoprene was applied, foragers increased their nursing and defense activities while nurses became mainly idle. The behavioral flexibility of foragers of the little fire ant may be evidence of an expansion of worker's repertoires as they age; older workers can perform tasks they have already done in their life while young individuals are not capable of performing tasks ahead of time. This may be an important adaptation associated with the success of this ant as an invasive species.",
  "Tropical rainforests are among the most diverse biomes on Earth. While species inventories are far from complete for any tropical rainforest, even less is known about the intricate species interactions that form the basis of these ecological communities. One fascinating but poorly studied example are the symbiotic associations between army ants and their rich assemblages of parasitic arthropod guests. Hundreds of these guests, or myrmecophiles, have been taxonomically described. However, because previous work has mainly been based on haphazard collections from disjunct populations, it remains challenging to define species boundaries. We therefore know little about the species richness, abundance and host specificity of most guests in any given population, which is crucial to understand co-evolutionary and ecological dynamics. Here, we report a quantitative community survey of myrmecophiles parasitizing the six sympatric Eciton army ant species in a Costa Rican rainforest. Combining DNA barcoding with morphological identification of over 2,000 specimens, we discovered 62 species, including 49 beetles, 11 flies, one millipede and one silverfish. At least 14 of these species were new to science. Ecological network analysis revealed a clear signal of host partitioning, and each Eciton species was host to both specialists and generalists. These varying degrees in host specificities translated into a moderate level of network specificity, highlighting the system's level of biotic pluralism in terms of biodiversity and interaction diversity. By providing vouchered DNA barcodes for army ant guest species, this study provides a baseline for future work on co-evolutionary and ecological dynamics in these species-rich host-symbiont networks across the Neotropical realm.",
  "Oxytocin/vasopressin-related neuropeptides are highly conserved and play major roles in regulating social behavior across vertebrates. However, whether their insect orthologue, inotocin, regulates the behavior of social groups remains unknown. Here, we show that in the clonal raider ant Ooceraea biroi, individuals that perform tasks outside the nest have higher levels of inotocin in their brains than individuals of the same age that remain inside the nest. We also show that older ants, which spend more time outside the nest, have higher inotocin levels than younger ants. Inotocin thus correlates with the propensity to perform tasks outside the nest. Additionally, increasing inotocin pharmacologically increases the tendency of ants to leave the nest. However, this effect is contingent on age and social context. Pharmacologically treated older ants have a higher propensity to leave the nest only in the presence of larvae, whereas younger ants seem to do so only in the presence of pupae. Our results suggest that inotocin signaling plays an important role in modulating behaviors that correlate with age, such as social foraging, possibly by modulating behavioral response thresholds to specific social cues. Inotocin signaling thereby likely contributes to behavioral individuality and division of labor in ant societies.",
  "Social insects, such as ants, bees, wasps, and termites, draw biologists' attention due to their distinctive lifestyles. As experimental systems, they provide unique opportunities to study organismal differentiation, division of labor, longevity, and the evolution of development. Ants are particularly attractive because several ant species can be propagated in the laboratory. However, the same lifestyle that makes social insects interesting also hampers the use of molecular genetic techniques. Here, we summarize the efforts of the ant research community to surmount these hurdles and obtain novel mechanistic insight into the biology of social insects. We review current approaches and propose novel ones involving genomics, transcriptomics, chromatin and DNA methylation profiling, RNA interference (RNAi), and genome editing in ants and discuss future experimental strategies.",
  "Ants show remarkable ecological and evolutionary success due to their social life history and division of labour among colony members. In some lineages, the worker force became subdivided into morphologically distinct individuals (i.e. minor versus major workers), allowing for the differential performance of particular roles in the colony. However, the functional and ecological significance of these morphological differences are not well understood. Here, we applied finite element analysis (FEA) to explore the biomechanical differences between major and minor ant worker mandibles. Analyses were carried out on mandibles of two Pheidole species, a dimorphic ant genus. We tested whether major mandibles evolved to minimize stress when compared to minors using combinations of the apical tooth and masticatory margin bites under strike and pressure conditions. Majors performed better in pressure conditions yet, contrary to our expectations, minors performed better in strike bite scenarios. Moreover, we demonstrated that even small morphological differences in ant mandibles might lead to substantial differences in biomechanical responses to bite loading. These results also underscore the potential of FEA to uncover biomechanical consequences of morphological differences within and between ant workers.",
  "Economic theory predicts that organisations achieve higher levels of productivity when tasks are divided among different subsets of workers. This prediction is based upon the expectation that individuals should perform best when they specialise upon a few tasks. However, in colonies of social insects evidence for a causal link between division of labour and performance is equivocal. To address this issue, we performed a targeted worker removal experiment to disrupt the normal allocation of workers to a cooperative team task - tandem running. During a tandem run a knowledgeable leader communicates the location of a new nest to a follower by physically guiding her there. The targeted removal of prominent leaders significantly reduced tandem performance, whereas removal of prominent followers had no effect. Furthermore, analyses of the experience of both participants in each tandem run revealed that tandem performance was influenced primarily by how consistently the leader acted as a leader when the need arose, but not by the consistency of the follower. Our study shows that performance in ant teams depends largely on whether or not a key role is filled by an experienced individual, and suggests that in animal teams, not all roles are equally important.",
  "Age-related behavioral plasticity is a major prerequisite for the ecological success of insect societies. Although ecological aspects of behavioral flexibility have been targeted in many studies, the underlying intrinsic mechanisms controlling the diverse changes in behavior along the individual life history of social insects are not completely understood. Recently, the neuropeptides allatostatin-A, corazonin, and tachykinin have been associated with the regulation of behavioral transitions in social insects. Here, we investigated changes in brain localization and expression of these neuropeptides following major behavioral transitions in Cataglyphis nodus ants. Our immunohistochemical analyses in the brain revealed that the overall branching pattern of neurons immunoreactive (ir) for the three neuropeptides is largely independent of the behavioral stages. Numerous allatostatin-A- and tachykinin-ir neurons innervate primary sensory neuropils and high-order integration centers of the brain. In contrast, the number of corazonergic neurons is restricted to only four neurons per brain hemisphere with cell bodies located in the pars lateralis and axons extending to the medial protocerebrum and the retrocerebral complex. Most interestingly, the cell-body volumes of these neurons are significantly increased in foragers compared to freshly eclosed ants and interior workers. Quantification of mRNA expression levels revealed a stage-related change in the expression of allatostatin-A and corazonin mRNA in the brain. Given the presence of the neuropeptides in major control centers of the brain and the neurohemal organs, these mRNA-changes strongly suggest an important modulatory role of both neuropeptides in the behavioral maturation of Cataglyphis ants.",
  "Foraging rhythms in eusocial insects are determined by the colony´s overall pattern. However, in leaf-cutting ant workers, individual rhythms are not fully synchronized with the colonies' rhythm. The colony as a whole is nocturnal, since most worker activity takes place at night; however some workers forage during the day. Previous studies in individualized ants suggest nocturnal and diurnal workers coexistence. Here observations within the colony, in leaf-cutting ants, showed that workers have differential foraging time preference, which interestingly is associated to body size and differential leaf transportation engagement. Nocturnal ants are smaller and less engaged in leaf transportation whereas diurnal ants are bigger and more engaged in leaf carriage. Mechanisms underlying division of labor in work shifts in ants are still unknown but much can be extrapolated from honeybees; another social system bearing a similar pattern. A collective organization like this favors constant exploitation of food sources while preserving natural individual rhythm patterns, which arise from individual differences, and thermal tolerance, given by the size polymorphism presented by this species.",
  "The remarkable ecological success of social insects is often attributed to their advanced division of labor, which is closely associated with temporal polyethism in which workers transition between different tasks as they age. Young nurses are typically found deep within the nest where they tend to the queen and the brood, whereas older foragers are found near the entrance and outside the nest.1-3 However, the individual-level maturation dynamics remain poorly understood because following individuals over relevant timescales is difficult; hence, previous experimental studies used same-age cohort designs.4-15 To address this, we used an automated tracking system to follow >500 individuals over >100 days and constructed networks of physical contacts to provide a continuous measure of worker social maturity. These analyses revealed that most workers occupied one of two steady states, namely a low-maturity nurse state and a high-maturity forager state, with the remaining workers rapidly transitioning between these states. There was considerable variation in the age at transition, and, surprisingly, the transition probability was age independent. This suggests that the transition is largely stochastic rather than a hard-wired age-dependent physiological change. Despite the variation in timing, the transition dynamics were highly stereotyped. Transitioning workers moved from the nurse to the forager state according to an S-shaped trajectory, and only began foraging after completing the transition. Stochastic switching, which occurs in many other biological systems, may provide ant colonies with robustness to extrinsic perturbations by allowing the colony to decouple its division of labor from its demography.",
  "The unique traits of eusocial insects, such as social behavior and reproductive division of labor, are controlled by their genetic system. To address how genes regulate social traits, we have developed mutant ants via delivery of CRISPR complex into young embryos during their syncytial stage. Here, we provide a protocol of CRISPR-mediated mutagenesis in Harpegnathos saltator, a ponerine ant species that displays striking phenotypic plasticity. H. saltator ants are readily reared in a laboratory setting. Embryos are collected for microinjection with Cas9 proteins and in vitro synthesized small guide RNAs (sgRNAs) using home-made quartz needles. Post-injection embryos are reared outside the colony. Following emergence of the first larva, all embryos and larvae are transported to a nest box with a few nursing workers for further development. This protocol is suitable for inducing mutagenesis for analysis of caste-specific physiology and social behavior in ants, but may also be applied to a broader spectrum of hymenopterans and other insects.",
  "Ant societies show a division of labor in which a queen is in charge of reproduction while nonreproductive workers maintain the colony. In Harpegnathos saltator, workers retain reproductive ability, inhibited by the queen pheromones. Following the queen loss, the colony undergoes social unrest with an antennal dueling tournament. Most workers quickly abandon the tournament while a few workers continue the dueling for months and become gamergates (pseudoqueens). However, the temporal dynamics of the social behavior and molecular mechanisms underlining the caste transition and social dominance remain unclear. By tracking behaviors, we show that the gamergate fate is accurately determined 3 d after initiation of the tournament. To identify genetic factors responsible for this commitment, we compared transcriptomes of different tissues between dueling and nondueling workers. We found that juvenile hormone is globally repressed, whereas ecdysone biosynthesis in the ovary is increased in gamergates. We show that molecular changes in the brain serve as earliest caste predictors compared with other tissues. Thus, behavioral and molecular data indicate that despite the prolonged social upheaval, the gamergate fate is rapidly established, suggesting a robust re-establishment of social structure.",
  "Ants use debris as tools to collect and transport liquid food to the nest. Previous studies showed that this behaviour is flexible whereby ants learn to use artificial material that is novel to them and select tools with optimal soaking properties. However, the process of tool use has not been studied at the individual level. We investigated whether workers specialise in tool use and whether there is a link between individual personality traits and tool use in the ant Aphaenogaster senilis. Only a small number of workers performed tool use and they did it repeatedly, although they also collected solid food. Personality predicted the probability to perform tool use: ants that showed higher exploratory activity and were more attracted to a prey in the personality tests became the new tool users when previous tool users were removed from the group. This suggests that, instead of extreme task specialisation, variation in personality traits within the colony may improve division of labour.",
  "Brain evolution is hypothesized to be driven by requirements to adaptively respond to environmental cues and social signals. Diverse models describe how sociality may have influenced eusocial insect-brain evolution, but specific impacts of social organization and other selective forces on brain architecture have been difficult to distinguish. Here, we evaluate predictions derived from and/or inferences made by models of social organization concerning the effects of individual and collective behavior on brain size, structure, and function using results of neuroanatomical and genomic studies. In contrast to the predictions of some models, we find that worker brains in socially complex species have great behavioral and cognitive capacity. We also find that colony size, the evolution of worker physical castes, and task specialization affect brain size and mosaicism, supporting the idea that sensory, processing and motor requirements for behavioral performance select for adaptive allometries of functionally specialized brain centers. We review available transcriptomic and comparative genomic studies seeking to elucidate the molecular pathways functionally associated with social life and the genetic changes that occurred during the evolution of social complexity. We discuss ways forward, using comparative neuroanatomy, transcriptomics, and comparative genomics, to distinguish among multiple alternative explanations for the relationship between the evolution of neural systems and social complexity.",
  "Biologists have long been fascinated by the processes that give rise to phenotypic complexity of organisms, yet whether there exist geographical hotspots of phenotypic complexity remains poorly explored. Phenotypic complexity can be readily observed in ant colonies, which are superorganisms with morphologically differentiated queen and worker castes analogous to the germline and soma of multicellular organisms. Several ant species have evolved 'worker polymorphism', where workers in a single colony show quantifiable differences in size and head-to-body scaling. Here, we use 256 754 occurrence points from 8990 ant species to investigate the geography of worker polymorphism. We show that arid regions of the world are the hotspots of superorganism complexity. Tropical savannahs and deserts, which are typically species-poor relative to tropical or even temperate forests, harbour the highest densities of polymorphic ants. We discuss the possible adaptive advantages that worker polymorphism provides in arid environments. Our work may provide a window into the environmental conditions that promote the emergence of highly complex phenotypes.",
  "Infections early in life can have enduring effects on an organism's development and immunity. In this study, we show that this equally applies to developing 'superorganisms'--incipient social insect colonies. When we exposed newly mated Lasius niger ant queens to a low pathogen dose, their colonies grew more slowly than controls before winter, but reached similar sizes afterwards. Independent of exposure, queen hibernation survival improved when the ratio of pupae to workers was small. Queens that reared fewer pupae before worker emergence exhibited lower pathogen levels, indicating that high brood rearing efforts interfere with the ability of the queen's immune system to suppress pathogen proliferation. Early-life queen pathogen exposure also improved the immunocompetence of her worker offspring, as demonstrated by challenging the workers to the same pathogen a year later. Transgenerational transfer of the queen's pathogen experience to her workforce can hence durably reduce the disease susceptibility of the whole superorganism.",
  "In this study, we used two common ant species (Lasius niger and Lasius neoniger) to assay how they translate variation in the diet (both in composition and frequency) into growth. We measured colony development for over 8 months and measured several phenotypic traits of the worker caste, and examined whether forager preference corresponded with diet quality. Optimal colony growth was a balance between survival and growth, and each of these was maximized with different nutrient regimes. Interestingly, forager preference was not totally aligned with the diet that maximized colony growth. Our results highlight that: (a) organism and superorganism size are controlled by the same nutrients, and this may reflect a common molecular basis for size across life's organizational levels, (b) there are nutrient trade-offs that are associated with life-history trade-offs, likely leading to selection for a balanced diet, and (c) the connection between the preference of foragers for different nutrients and how nutrient combinations affect colony success and demographics are complex and only beginning to be understood.",
  "Allocation of goods is a key feature in defining the connection between the individual and the collective scale in any society. Both the process by which goods are to be distributed, and the resulting allocation to the members of the society may affect the success of the population as a whole. One of the most striking natural examples of a highly successful cooperative society is the ant colony which often acts as a single superorganism. In particular, each individual within the ant colony has a \"communal stomach\" which is used to store and share food with the other colony members by mouth to mouth feeding. Sharing food between communal stomachs allows the colony as a whole to get its food requirements and, more so, allows each individual within the colony to reach its nutritional intake target. The vast majority of colony members do not forage independently but obtain their food through secondary interactions in which food is exchanged between individuals. The global effect of this exchange is not well understood. To gain better understanding into this process we used fluorescence imaging to measure how food from a single external source is distributed and mixed within a Camponotus sanctus ant colony. Using entropic measures to quantify food-blending, we show that while collected food flows into all parts of the colony it mixes only partly. We show that mixing is controlled by the ants' interaction rule which implies that only a fraction of the maximal potential is actually transferred. This rule leads to a robust blending process: i.e., neither the exact food volume that is transferred, nor the interaction schedule are essential to generate the global outcome. Finally, we show how the ants' interaction rules may optimize a trade-off between fast dissemination and efficient mixing. Our results regarding the distribution of a single food source provide a baseline for future studies on distributed regulation of multiple food sources in social insect colonies.",
  "Leafcutter ants are the ultimate insect superorganisms, with up to millions of physiologically specialized workers cooperating to cut and transport vegetation and then convert it into compost used to cultivate co-evolved fungi, domesticated over millions of years. We tested hypotheses about the nutrient-processing dynamics governing this functional integration, tracing 15 N- and 13 C-enriched substrates through colonies of the leafcutter ant Atta colombica. Our results highlight striking performance efficiencies, including rapid conversion (within 2 d) of harvested nutrients into edible fungal tissue (swollen hyphal tips called gongylidia) in the center of fungus gardens, while also highlighting that much of each colony's foraging effort resulted in substrate placed directly in the trash. We also find nutrient-specific processing dynamics both within and across layers of the fungus garden, and in ant consumers. Larvae exhibited higher overall levels of 15 N and 13 C enrichment than adult workers, supporting that the majority of fungal productivity is allocated to colony growth. Foragers assimilated 13 C-labeled glucose during its ingestion, but required several days to metabolically process ingested 15 N-labeled ammonium nitrate. This processing timeline helps resolve a 40-yr old hypothesis, that foragers (but apparently not gardeners or larvae) bypass their fungal crops to directly assimilate some of the nutrients they ingest outside the nest. Tracing these nutritional pathways with stable isotopes helps visualize how physiological integration within symbiotic networks gives rise to the ecologically dominant herbivory of leafcutter ants in habitats ranging from Argentina to the southern United States.",
  "The physical spaces within which organisms live affect their biology and in many cases can be considered part of their extended phenotype. The nests of social insect societies have a fundamental impact on their ability to function as complex superorganisms. Ants in many species excavate elaborate subterranean nests, but others inhabit relatively small pre-formed cavities within rock crevices and hollow seeds. Temnothorax ants, which often nest within acorns, have become a model system for studying collective decision making. While these ants have demonstrated remarkable degrees of rationality and consistent precision with regard to their nest choices, never before has the fine scale internal architecture and spatial organization of their nests been investigated. We used X-ray microtomography to record high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) scans of Temnothorax colonies within their acorns. These data were then quantified using image segmentation and surface-based 3D visibility graph analysis, a new computational methodology for analysing spatial structures. The visibility graph analysis method integrates knowledge from the field of architecture with the empirical study of animal-built structures, thus providing the first methodological cross-disciplinary synergy of these two research areas. We found a surprisingly high surface area and degree of spatial heterogeneity within the acorn nests. Specific regions, such as those associated with the locations of queens and brood, were significantly more conducive to connectivity than others. From an architect's point of view, spatial analysis research has never focused on all-surface 3D movement, as we describe within ant nests. Therefore, we believe our approach will provide new methods for understanding both human design and the comparative biology of habitat spaces.This article is part of the theme issue 'Interdisciplinary approaches for uncovering the impacts of architecture on collective behaviour'.",
  "Among social insects, colony-level variation is likely to be widespread and has significant ecological consequences. Very few studies, however, have documented how genetic factors relate to behaviour at the colony level. Differences in expression of the foraging gene have been associated with differences in foraging and activity of a wide variety of organisms. We quantified expression of the red imported fire ant foraging gene (sifor) in workers from 21 colonies collected across the natural range of Texas fire ant populations, but maintained under standardized, environmentally controlled conditions. Colonies varied significantly in their behaviour. The most active colonies had up to 10 times more active foragers than the least active colony and more than 16 times as many workers outside the nest. Expression differences among colonies correlated with this colony-level behavioural variation. Colonies with higher sifor expression in foragers had, on average, significantly higher foraging activity, exploratory activity and recruitment to nectar than colonies with lower expression. Expression of sifor was also strongly correlated with worker task (foraging vs. working in the interior of the nest). These results provide insight into the genetic and physiological processes underlying collective differences in social behaviour. Quantifying variation in expression of the foraging gene may provide an important tool for understanding and predicting the ecological consequences of colony-level behavioural variation.",
  "Insect societies are complex systems, displaying emergent properties much greater than the sum of their individual parts. As such, the concept of these societies as single 'superorganisms' is widely applied to describe their organisation and biology. Here, we test the applicability of this concept to the response of social insect colonies to predation during a vulnerable period of their life history. We used the model system of house-hunting behaviour in the ant Temnothorax albipennis. We show that removing individuals from directly within the nest causes an evacuation response, while removing ants at the periphery of scouting activity causes the colony to withdraw back into the nest. This suggests that colonies react differentially, but in a coordinated fashion, to these differing types of predation. Our findings lend support to the superorganism concept, as the whole society reacts much like a single organism would in response to attacks on different parts of its body. The implication of this is that a collective reaction to the location of worker loss within insect colonies is key to avoiding further harm, much in the same way that the nervous systems of individuals facilitate the avoidance of localised damage.",
  "The question on how individuals allocate resources into maintenance and reproduction is one of the central questions in life history theory. Yet, resource allocation into maintenance on the organismic level can only be measured indirectly. This is different in a social insect colony, a \"superorganism\" where workers represent the soma and the queen the germ line of the colony. Here, we investigate whether trade-offs exist between maintenance and reproduction on two levels of biological organization, queens and colonies, by following single-queen colonies of the ant Cardiocondyla obscurior throughout the entire lifespan of the queen. Our results show that maintenance and reproduction are positively correlated on the colony level, and we confirm results of an earlier study that found no trade-off on the individual (queen) level. We attribute this unexpected outcome to the existence of a positive feedback loop where investment into maintenance (workers) increases the rate of resource acquisition under laboratory conditions. Even though food was provided ad libitum, variation in productivity among the colonies suggests that resources can only be utilized and invested into additional maintenance and reproduction by the colony if enough workers are available. The resulting relationship between per-capita and colony productivity in our study fits well with other studies conducted in the field, where decreasing per-capita productivity and the leveling off of colony productivity have been linked to density dependent effects due to competition among colonies. This suggests that the absence of trade-offs in our laboratory study might also be prevalent under natural conditions, leading to a positive association of maintenance, (= growth) and reproduction. In this respect, insect colonies resemble indeterminate growing organisms.",
  "The ecological dominance of ants has to a great extent been achieved through their collective action and complex social organization. Ants provide diverse model systems to examine the neural underpinnings of individual behavior and group action that contribute to their evolutionary success. Core elements of ant colony structure such as reproductive and ergonomic division of labor, task specialization, and social integration are beginning to be understood in terms of cellular neuroanatomy and neurochemistry. In this review we discuss the neuroethology of colony organization by focusing on the role of biogenic amines in the control of social behavior in ants. We examine the role of neuromodulation in significant sociobiological characteristics of ants, including reproductive hierarchies, colony foundation, social food flow, nestmate recognition, territoriality, and size- and age-related sensory perception and task performance as well as the involvement of monoamines in collective intelligence, the ultimate key to the global dominance of these remarkable superorganisms. We conclude by suggesting future directions for the analysis of the aminergic regulation of behavior and social complexity in ants.",
  "Social insect societies dominate many terrestrial ecosystems across the planet. Colony members cooperate to capture and use resources to maximize survival and reproduction. Yet, when compared with solitary organisms, we understand relatively little about the factors responsible for differences in the rates of survival, growth and reproduction among colonies. To explain these differences, we present a mathematical model that predicts these three rates for ant colonies based on the body sizes and metabolic rates of colony members. Specifically, the model predicts that smaller colonies tend to use more energy per gram of biomass, live faster and die younger. Model predictions are supported with data from whole colonies for a diversity of species, with much of the variation in colony-level life history explained based on physiological traits of individual ants. The theory and data presented here provide a first step towards a more general theory of colony life history that applies across species and environments.",
  "Observed phenotype often fails to correspond with genotype. Although it is well established that uncontrolled genetic modifier effects and environmental variability can affect phenotype, stochastic variation in gene expression can also contribute to phenotypic differences. Here we examine recent work that has provided insights into how fundamental physical properties of living cells, and the probabilistic nature of the chemical reactions that underlie gene expression, introduce noise. We focus on instances in which a stochastic decision initiates an event in the development of a multicellular organism and how that decision can be subsequently fixed. We present an example indicating that a similar interplay between an initial stochastic decision and subsequent fixation may underlie the regulation of reproduction in social insects. We argue, therefore, that stochasticity affects biological processes from the single-gene scale through to the complex organization of an ant colony, and represents a largely neglected component of phenotypic variation and evolution.",
  "Caste evolution is a central process in the adaptive diversification of insect superorganisms. Nevertheless, how ecology shapes adaptive caste evolution remains poorly understood. Recent work with the ant genus Cephalotes has provided new comparative evidence that ecological specialization may drive adaptive caste specialization. Here, three key predictions of this adaptive hypothesis are supported, using a representative of the highest level of ecological specialization and the most specialized soldier phenotype. First, soldier defensive performance was maximal for the specific nesting resource used most often in nature. Second, colonies only used a specialized subset of available nesting resources and preferred the specific resource that maximizes soldier performance. Third, soldier performance and its limitations on resource use were found to have both direct and indirect consequences for colony reproduction. These findings suggest that the most specialized soldier phenotype in Cephalotes is indeed an adaptation to ecological specialization on a narrowly defined subset of available nesting resources.",
  "The sharing and collective processing of information by certain insect societies is one of the reasons that they warrant the superlative epithet 'super-organisms' (Franks 1989, Am. Sci. 77, 138-145). We describe a detailed experimental and mathematical analysis of information exchange and decision-making in, arguably, the most difficult collective choices that social insects face: namely, house hunting by complete societies. The key issue is how can a complete colony select the single best nest-site among several alternatives? Individual scouts respond to the diverse information they have personally obtained about the quality of a potential nest-site by producing a recruitment signal. The colony then deliberates over (i.e. integrates) different incoming recruitment signals associated with different potential nest-sites to achieve a well-informed collective decision. We compare this process in honeybees and in the ant Leptothorax albipennis. Notwithstanding many differences - for example, honeybee colonies have 100 times more individuals than L. albipennis colonies - there are certain similarities in the fundamental algorithms these societies appear to employ when they are house hunting. Scout honeybees use the full power of the waggle dance to inform their nest-mates about the distance and direction of a potential nest-site (and they indicate the quality of a nest-site indirectly through the vigour of their dance), and yet individual bees perhaps only rarely make direct comparisons of such sites. By contrast, scouts from L. albipennis colonies often compare nest-sites, but they cannot directly inform one another of their estimation of the quality of a potential site. Instead, they discriminate between sites by initiating recruitment sooner to better ones. Nevertheless, both species do make use of forms of opinion polling. For example, scout bees that have formerly danced for a certain site cease such advertising and monitor the dances of others at random. That is, they act without prejudice. They neither favour nor disdain dancers that advocate the site they had formerly advertised or the alternatives. Thus, in general the bees are less well informed than they would be if they systematically monitored dances for alternative sites rather than spending their time reprocessing information they already have. However, as a result of their lack of prejudice, less time overall will be wasted in endless debate among stubborn and potentially biased bees. Among the ants, the opinions of nest-mates are also pooled effectively when scouts use a threshold population of their nest-mates present in a new nest-site as a cue to switch to more rapid recruitment. Furthermore, the ants' reluctance to begin recruiting to poor nest-sites means that more time is available for the discovery and direct comparison of alternatives. Likewise, the retirement of honeybee scouts from dancing for a given site allows more time for other scouts to find potentially better sites. Thus, both the ants and the bees have time-lags built into their decision-making systems that should facilitate a compromise between thorough surveys for good nest-sites and relatively rapid decisions. We have also been able to show that classical mathematical models can illuminate the processes by which colonies are able to achieve decisions that are relatively swift and very well informed.",
  "Parasites and pathogens often impose significant costs on their hosts. This is particularly true for social organisms, where the genetic structure of groups and the accumulation of contaminated waste facilitate disease transmission. In response, hosts have evolved many mechanisms of defence against parasites. Here we present evidence that Atta colombica, a leaf-cutting ant, may combat Escovopsis, a dangerous parasite of Atta's garden fungus, through a colony-level behavioural response. In A. colombica, garden waste is removed from within the colony and transported to the midden--an external waste dump--where it is processed by a group of midden workers. We found that colonies infected with Escovopsis have higher numbers of workers on the midden, where Escovopsis is deposited. Further, midden workers are highly effective in dispersing newly deposited waste away from the dumping site. Thus, the colony-level task allocation strategies of the Atta superorganism may change in response to the threat of disease to a third, essential party.",
  "BACKGROUND: Eusociality is widely considered to evolve through kin selection, where the reproductive success of an individual's close relative is favored at the expense of its own. High genetic relatedness is thus considered a prerequisite for eusociality. While ants are textbook examples of eusocial animals, not all ants form colonies of closely related individuals. One such example is the ectatommine ant Rhytidoponera metallica, which predominantly forms queen-less colonies that have such a low intra-colony relatedness that they have been proposed to represent a transient, unstable form of eusociality. However, R. metallica is among the most abundant and widespread ants on the Australian continent. This apparent contradiction provides an example of how inclusive fitness may not by itself explain the maintenance of eusociality and raises the question of what other selective advantages maintain the eusocial lifestyle of this species. RESULTS: We provide a comprehensive portrait of the venom of R. metallica and show that the colony-wide venom consists of an exceptionally high diversity of functionally distinct toxins for an ant. These toxins have evolved under strong positive selection, which is normally expected to reduce genetic variance. Yet, R. metallica exhibits remarkable intra-colony variation, with workers sharing only a relatively small proportion of toxins in their venoms. This variation is not due to the presence of chemical castes, but has a genetic foundation that is at least in part explained by toxin allelic diversity. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results suggest that the toxin diversity contained in R. metallica colonies may be maintained by a form of group selection that selects for colonies that can exploit more resources and defend against a wider range of predators. We propose that increased intra-colony genetic variance resulting from low kinship may itself provide a selective advantage in the form of an expanded pharmacological venom repertoire. These findings provide an example of how group selection on adaptive phenotypes may contribute to maintaining eusociality where a prerequisite for kin selection is diminished.",
  "A new study maps individual Formica ant queens' tendency to produce single-sex offspring to a so-called 'supergene' locus. This supergene neighbors another supergene determining social structure. Consequently, single-queen and multi-queen colonies disproportionately produce daughters and sons, respectively. This association mirrors the predictions of kin selection, though other possible explanations remain.",
  "The genetic structure of populations can be both a cause and a consequence of ecological interactions. For parasites, genetic structure may be a consequence of preferences for host species or of mating behaviour. Conversely, genetic structure can influence where conspecific interactions among parasites lay on a spectrum from cooperation to conflict. We used microsatellite loci to characterize the genetic structure of a population of the socially parasitic dulotic (aka \"slave-making\") ant (Polyergus mexicanus), which is known for its host-specificity and conspecific aggression. First, we assessed whether the pattern of host species use by the parasite has influenced parasite population structure. We found that host species use was correlated with subpopulation structure, but this correlation was imperfect: some subpopulations used one host species nearly exclusively, while others used several. Second, we examined the viscosity of the parasite population by measuring the relatedness of pairs of neighbouring parasitic ant colonies at varying distances from each other. Although natural history observations of local dispersal by queens suggested the potential for viscosity, there was no strong correlation between relatedness and distance between colonies. However, 35% of colonies had a closely related neighbouring colony, indicating that kinship could potentially affect the nature of some interactions between colonies of this social parasite. Our findings confirm that ecological forces like host species selection can shape the genetic structure of parasite populations, and that such genetic structure has the potential to influence parasite-parasite interactions in social parasites via inclusive fitness.",
  "The fitness consequences of joining a group are highly dependent on ecological context, especially for non-kin. To assess the relationships between cooperation and environment, we examined variation in colony reproductive success for a harvester ant species that nests either solitarily or with multiple, unrelated queens, a social strategy known as primary polygyny. We measured the reproductive investment of colonies of solitary versus social nesting types at two sites, one with primarily single-queen colonies, and the other with a majority of polygynous nests. Our results were consistent with the hypothesis that cooperative nesting by unrelated ant queens is likely a selection response to difficult environments, rather than a strategy to maximize reproduction under favorable conditions. Fewer colonies at the primarily polygynous site reproduced than at the site with primarily single queen nests, and those that did had lower reproductive investment, as measured by number and total mass of reproductives. Assessment of ecological conditions also support the harsh environment hypothesis. Colony density in the multi-queen population was higher, and nearest neighbor distances were lower for non-reproducing than reproducing colonies. To more directly test the hypothesis that colony reproduction was ecologically constrained, we experimentally supplemented food resources for a subset of colonies at the primary polygyny site. Supplemented colonies increased reproductive investment levels to equal that of colonies at the single-queen population, further indicating that environmental pressures are severe where primary polygyny is dominant, and may drive the evolution of non-kin cooperation in this context.",
  "Altruism is a paradox in Darwinian evolution. Policing is an important mechanism of the evolution and maintenance of altruism. A recently developed dynamic game model incorporating colony demography and inclusive fitness predicts that, in hymenopteran social insects, policing behaviour enforcing reproductive altruism in group members depends strongly on the colony growth stage, with strong policing as the colony develops and a relaxation of policing during the reproductive phase. Here, we report clear evidence supporting this prediction. In the ant Diacamma sp., reproduction by workers was suppressed by worker policing when the colony was small, whereas in large, mature colonies worker policing was relaxed and worker-produced males emerged. Conditional expression of traits can provide strong empirical evidence for natural selection theory if the expression pattern is precisely predicted by the theory, and our results illustrate the importance of intracolony population dynamics in the evolution of social systems.",
  "Eusocial Hymenoptera colonies are characterized by the presence of altruistic individuals, which rear their siblings instead of their own offspring. In the course of evolution, such sterile castes are thought to have emerged through the process of kin selection, altruistic traits being transmitted to following generation if they benefit relatives. By allowing kinship recognition, the detection of cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) might be instrumental for kin selection. In carpenter ants, a female-specific olfactory subsystem processes CHC information through antennal detection by basiconic sensilla. It is still unclear if other families of eusocial Hymenoptera use the same subsystem for sensing CHCs. Here, we examined the existence of such a subsystem in Vespidae (using the hornet Vespa velutina), a family in which eusociality emerged independently of ants. The antennae of both males and female hornets contain large basiconic sensilla. Sensory neurons from the large basiconic sensilla exclusively project to a conspicuous cluster of small glomeruli in the antennal lobe, with anatomical and immunoreactive features that are strikingly similar to those of the ant CHC-sensitive subsystem. Extracellular electrophysiological recordings further show that sensory neurons within hornet basiconic sensilla preferentially respond to CHCs. Although this subsystem is not female-specific in hornets, the observed similarities with the olfactory system of ants are striking. They suggest that the basiconic sensilla subsystem could be an ancestral trait, which may have played a key role in the advent of eusociality in these hymenopteran families by allowing kin recognition and the production of altruistic behaviors toward relatives.",
  "Kin selection is thought to drive the evolution of cooperation and conflict, but the specific genes and genome-wide patterns shaped by kin selection are unknown. We identified thousands of genes associated with the sterile ant worker caste, the archetype of an altruistic phenotype shaped by kin selection, and then used population and comparative genomic approaches to study patterns of molecular evolution at these genes. Consistent with population genetic theoretical predictions, worker-upregulated genes experienced reduced selection compared with genes upregulated in reproductive castes. Worker-upregulated genes included more taxonomically restricted genes, indicating that the worker caste has recruited more novel genes, yet these genes also experienced reduced selection. Our study identifies a putative genomic signature of kin selection and helps to integrate emerging sociogenomic data with longstanding social evolution theory.",
  "Ant supercolonies are the largest cooperative units known in nature. They consist of networks of interconnected nests with hundreds of reproductive queens, where individuals move freely between nests, cooperate across nest boundaries and show little aggression towards non-nestmates. The combination of high queen numbers and free mixing of workers, queens and brood between nests results in extremely low nestmate relatedness. In such low-relatedness societies, cooperative worker behaviour appears maladaptive because it may aid random individuals instead of relatives. Here, we provide a comprehensive picture of genetic substructure in supercolonies of the native wood ant Formica aquilonia using traditional population genetic as well as network analysis methods. Specifically, we test for spatial and temporal variation in genetic structure of different classes of individuals within supercolonies and analyse the role of worker movement in determining supercolony genetic networks. We find that relatedness within supercolonies is low but positive when viewed on a population level, which may be due to limited dispersal of individuals and/or ecological factors such as nest site limitation and competition against conspecifics. Genetic structure of supercolonies varied with both sample class and sampling time point, which indicates that mobility of individuals varies according to both caste and season and suggests that generalizing has to be carried out with caution in studies of supercolonial species. Overall, our analysis provides novel evidence that native wood ant supercolonies exhibit fine-scale genetic substructure, which may explain the maintenance of cooperation in these low-relatedness societies.",
  "Sex allocation theory predicts parents should adjust their investment in male and female offspring in a way that increases parental fitness. This has been shown in several species and selective contexts. Yet, seasonal sex ratio variation within species and its underlying causes are poorly understood. Here, we study sex allocation variation in the wood ant Formica pratensis. This species displays conflict over colony sex ratio as workers and queens prefer different investment in male and female offspring, owing to haplodiploidy and relatedness asymmetries. It is unique among Formica ants because it produces two separate sexual offspring cohorts per season. We predict sex ratios to be closer to queen optimum in the early cohort but more female-biased and closer to worker optimum in the later one. This is because the power of workers to manipulate colony sex ratio varies seasonally with the availability of diploid eggs. Consistently, more female-biased sex ratios in the later offspring cohort over a three-year sampling period from 93 colonies clearly support our prediction. The resulting seasonal alternation of sex ratios between queen and worker optima is a novel demonstration how understanding constraints of sex ratio adjustment increases our ability to predict sex ratio variation.",
  "How can antiparasite defence traits evolve even if they do not directly benefit their carriers? An example of such an indirect defence is rebellion of enslaved Temnothorax longispinosus ant workers against their social parasite Temnothorax americanus, a slavemaking ant. Ant slaves have been observed to kill their oppressors' offspring, a behaviour from which the sterile slaves cannot profit directly. Parasite brood killing could, however, reduce raiding pressure on related host colonies nearby. We analyse with extensive computer simulations for the Temnothorax slavemaker system under what conditions a hypothetical rebel allele could invade a host population, and in particular, how host-parasite dynamics and population structure influence the rebel allele's success. Exploring a wide range of model parameters, we only found a small number of parameter combinations for which kin selection or multilevel selection could allow a slave rebellion allele to spread in the host population. Furthermore, we did not detect any cases in which the reduction of raiding pressure in the close vicinity of the slavemaker nest would substantially contribute to the inclusive fitness of rebels. This suggests that slave rebellion is not costly and perhaps a side-effect of some other beneficial trait. In some of our simulations, however, even a costly rebellion allele could spread in the population. This was possible when host-parasite interactions led to a metapopulation dynamic with frequent local extinctions and recolonizations of demes by the offspring of few immigrants.",
  "Polygyny in social insects can greatly reduce within-nest genetic relatedness. In polygynous ant species, potential rival queens in colonies with multiple queens are often executed by other queens, workers, or both. The Argentine ant, Linepithema humile, native to South America, forms a \"supercolony\" that is composed of a large number of nests and is considered to contribute to the ant's invasion success. Currently, four mutually antagonistic supercolonies are contiguously distributed within a small area of Japan. Here, we analyzed the genetic structure and relatedness within and among the four supercolonies using microsatellite markers to clarify how L. humile maintains its supercoloniality. The results of AMOVA and BASP, the F ST values, and the existence of several private alleles indicated that the L. humile population in the Kobe area had a characteristic genetic structure. Within a given supercolony, there was significant genetic differentiation (F ST) among workers collected in May and those collected in September. The significant deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium increased, and the relatedness among workers significantly increased from May to September in all supercolonies. This result suggested that the supercolonies replaced old queens with new ones during the reproductive season, thus supporting the plausibility of queen execution. From the perspective of kin selection, workers collectively eliminate queens, thereby increasing their own inclusive fitness. Restricted gene flow among supercolonies, together with mating with sib and queen execution, could help to maintain the unique social structure of L. humile, the distribution of which is expanding worldwide.",
  "Conflict arises among social organisms when individuals differ in their inclusive-fitness interests. Ant societies are excellent models for understanding how genetic relatedness mediates conflict intensity. However, although conflicts within colonies typically arise over offspring production, the role of larvae as actors in social conflict has received little attention. We develop and empirically test kin-selection theory of larval egg cannibalism in ant societies. Specifically, we investigate how selection for cannibalism is mediated by nestmate relatedness and larval sex in a mathematical model and then test the model's predictions by measuring cannibalism levels in eight ant species with varying nestmate relatedness. In line with our theoretical predictions, cannibalism levels in larvae were significantly influenced by relatedness and sex. Increased relatedness was associated with reduced levels of cannibalism, indicating that larval behavior is mediated by inclusive-fitness considerations. Levels of cannibalism were significantly higher in male larvae, and our model suggests that this is due to sex differences in the benefits of cannibalism. By examining the selfish interests of larvae and the constraints they face in a social environment, our study presents a novel perspective on conflict in ants and on the evolution of selfish elements in social systems in general.",
  "Sympatric speciation normally requires particular conditions of ecological niche differentiation. However, ant social parasites have been suspected to arise sympatrically, because (dis)loyalty to eusocial kin-structures induces disruptive selection for dispersal and inbreeding. A new study documents this process in unprecedented detail.",
  "Hamilton is probably best known for his seminal work demonstrating the role of kin selection in social evolution. His work made it clear that, for individuals to direct their altruistic behaviours towards appropriate recipients (kin), mechanisms must exist for kin recognition. In the social insects, colonies are typically comprised of kin, and colony recognition cues are used as proxies for kinship cues. Recent years have brought rapid advances in our understanding of the genetic and molecular mechanisms that are used for this process. Here, I review some of the most notable advances, particularly the contributions from recent ant genome sequences and molecular biology.",
  "In the ant Pristomyrmex punctatus Smith (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), all young workers lay a small number of eggs parthenogenetically. Some colonies consist of monoclonal individuals that provide high inclusive fitness, according to the kin selection theory. However, in some populations, a majority of the colonies contain multiple lineages. Intracolonial genetic variation of parthenogenetic ants cannot be explained by the multiple mating of single founderesses or by the foundation of a colony by multiple foundresses, which are the usual causes of genetically diverse colonies in social insects. Here, we hypothesized that the fusion of established colonies might facilitate the formation of multiclonal colonies. Colony fusion decreases indirect benefits because of the reduction in intracolonial relatedness. However, when suitable nesting places for overwintering are scarce, colony fusion provides a strategy for the survival of colonies. Here, ants derived from different colonies were allowed to encounter one another in a container with just one nesting place. Initially, high aggression was observed; however, after several days, no aggression was observed and the ants shared the nest. When the fused colonies were allowed to transfer to two alternative nests, ants from different colonies occupied the same nest. This study highlights the importance of limiting the number of nesting places in order to understand the genetic diversity of parthenogenetic ant colonies.",
  "Communication between organisms involves visual, auditory, and olfactory pathways. In solitary insects, chemical recognition cues are influenced mainly by selection regimes related to species recognition and sexual selection. In social insects, chemical recognition cues have an additional role in mediating recognition of society members and, thereby, allowing kin selection to operate. Here, we examined whether cuticular hydrocarbon profiles are sex-specific and whether males and young queens of the ant Formica fusca have colony-specific profiles. We also investigated whether there is a relationship between genetic relatedness and chemical diversity within colonies. We demonstrated that female and male sexuals do not have unique sex-specific compounds, but that there are quantitative chemical differences between the sexes. Out of the 51 cuticular hydrocarbon compounds identified, 10 showed a significant quantitative difference between males and females. We also showed that both males and females have a significant colony-specific component in their profiles. Finally, we found a negative correlation between within-colony relatedness and within-colony chemical diversity of branched, but not linear compounds. This suggests that colonies with multiple matri- or patrilines also have a significantly greater chemical diversity.",
  "The evolution of sociality represented a major transition point in biological history. The most advanced societies, such as those displayed by social insects, consist of reproductive and nonreproductive castes. The caste system fundamentally affects the way natural selection operates. Specifically, selection acts directly on reproductive castes, such as queens, but only indirectly through the process of kin selection on nonreproductive castes, such as workers. In this study, we present theoretical analyses to determine the rate of substitution at loci expressed exclusively in the queen or worker castes. We show that the rate of substitution is the same for queen- and worker-selected loci when the queen is singly mated. In contrast, when a queen is multiply mated, queen-selected loci show higher rates of substitution for adaptive alleles and lower rates of substitution for deleterious alleles than worker-selected loci. We compare our theoretical expectations to previously obtained genomic data from the honeybee, Apis mellifera, where queens mate multiply and the fire ant, Solenopsis invicta, where queens mate singly and find that rates of evolution of queen- and worker-selected loci are consistent with our predictions. Overall, our research tests theoretical expectations using empirically obtained genomic data to better understand the evolution of advanced societies.",
  "Relatedness is a central parameter in the evolution of sociality, because kin selection theory assumes that individuals involved in altruistic interactions are related. At least three reproductive characteristics are known to profoundly affect colony kin structure in social insects: the number of reproductive queens per colony, the relatedness among breeding queens and queen mating frequency. Both the occurrence of multiple queens (polygyny) and multiple mating (polyandry) decrease within-colony relatedness, while mating among sibs increases relatedness between the workers and the brood they rear. Using DNA microsatellites, we performed a detailed genetic analysis of the colony kin structure and breeding system in three ant species belonging to the genus Plagiolepis: P. schmitzii, P. taurica and P. maura. Our data show that queens of the three species mate multiply: queens of P. maura mate with 1-2 males, queens of P. taurica with 3-11 males and queens of P. schmitzii may have 1-14 different mates. Moreover, colonies are headed by multiple queens: P. taurica and P. maura are facultatively polygynous, while P. schmitzii is obligately polygynous. Despite polyandry and polygyny, relatedness within colonies remains high because all species are characterized by sib-mating, with a fixation index F(it) = 0.25 in P. taurica, 0.24 in P. schmitzii and 0.26 in P. maura, and because the male mates of a queen are on average closely related.",
  "Although social groups are characterized by cooperation, they are also often the scene of conflict. In non-clonal systems, the reproductive interests of group members will differ and individuals may benefit by exploiting the cooperative efforts of other group members. However, such selfish behaviour is thought to be rare in one of the classic examples of cooperation--social insect colonies--because the colony-level costs of individual selfishness select against cues that would allow workers to recognize their closest relatives. In accord with this, previous studies of wasps and ants have found little or no kin information in recognition cues. Here, we test the hypothesis that social insects do not have kin-informative recognition cues by investigating the recognition cues and relatedness of workers from four colonies of the ant Acromyrmex octospinosus. Contrary to the theoretical prediction, we show that the cuticular hydrocarbons of ant workers in all four colonies are informative enough to allow full-sisters to be distinguished from half-sisters with a high accuracy. These results contradict the hypothesis of non-heritable recognition cues and suggest that there is more potential for within-colony conflicts in genetically diverse societies than previously thought.",
  "Multiple functional queens in a colony (polygyny) and multiple mating by queens (polyandry) in social insects challenge kin selection, because they dilute inclusive fitness benefits from helping. Colonies of the ant Plagiolepis pygmaea brash contain several hundreds of multiply mated queens. Yet, within-colony relatedness remains unexpectedly high. This stems from low male dispersal, extensive mating among relatives and adoption of young queens in the natal colony. We investigated whether inbreeding results from workers expelling foreign males, and/or from preferential mating between related partners. Our data show that workers actively repel unrelated males entering their colony, and that queens preferentially mate with related males. These results are consistent with inclusive fitness being a driving force for inbreeding: by preventing outbreeding, workers reduce erosion of relatedness within colonies due to polygyny and polyandry. That virgin queens mate preferentially with related males could result from a long history of inbreeding, which is expected to reduce depression in species with regular sibmating.",
  "BACKGROUND: Animal societies are diverse, ranging from small family-based groups to extraordinarily large social networks in which many unrelated individuals interact. At the extreme of this continuum, some ant species form unicolonial populations in which workers and queens can move among multiple interconnected nests without eliciting aggression. Although unicoloniality has been mostly studied in invasive ants, it also occurs in some native non-invasive species. Unicoloniality is commonly associated with very high queen number, which may result in levels of relatedness among nestmates being so low as to raise the question of the maintenance of altruism by kin selection in such systems. However, the actual relatedness among cooperating individuals critically depends on effective dispersal and the ensuing pattern of genetic structuring. In order to better understand the evolution of unicoloniality in native non-invasive ants, we investigated the fine-scale population genetic structure and gene flow in three unicolonial populations of the wood ant F. paralugubris. RESULTS: The analysis of geo-referenced microsatellite genotypes and mitochondrial haplotypes revealed the presence of cryptic clusters of genetically-differentiated nests in the three populations of F. paralugubris. Because of this spatial genetic heterogeneity, members of the same clusters were moderately but significantly related. The comparison of nuclear (microsatellite) and mitochondrial differentiation indicated that effective gene flow was male-biased in all populations. CONCLUSION: The three unicolonial populations exhibited male-biased and mostly local gene flow. The high number of queens per nest, exchanges among neighbouring nests and restricted long-distance gene flow resulted in large clusters of genetically similar nests. The positive relatedness among clustermates suggests that kin selection may still contribute to the maintenance of altruism in unicolonial populations if competition occurs among clusters.",
  "Unicolonial ant populations are the most extensive cooperative units known in nature, forming networks of interconnected nests extending sometimes hundreds of kilometers. Within such a supercolony, worker altruistic behavior might be maladaptive, because it seems to aid random members of the population instead of relatives. However, recent genetic and behavioral data show that, viewed on a sufficiently large scale, unicolonial ants do have colony boundaries that define very large kin groups. It seems likely that they are family groups that continue to express their kin-selected behavior as they grow to extreme sizes. However, at extreme sizes, kin selection theory predicts that these behaviors are maladapted and evolutionarily unstable, a prediction that is supported by their twiggy phylogenetic distribution.",
  "Recognition of group-members is a key feature of sociality. Ants use chemical communication to discriminate nestmates from intruders, enhancing kin cooperation and preventing parasitism. The recognition code is embedded in their cuticular chemical profile, which typically varies between colonies. We predicted that ants might be capable of accurate recognition in unusual situations when few individuals interact repeatedly, as new colonies started by two to three queens. Individual recognition would be favoured by selection when queens establish dominance hierarchies, because repeated fights for dominance are costly; but it would not evolve in absence of hierarchies. We previously showed that Pachycondyla co-founding queens, which form dominance hierarchies, have accurate individual recognition based on chemical cues. Here, we used the ant Lasius niger to test the null hypothesis that individual recognition does not occur when co-founding queens do not establish dominance hierarchies. Indeed, L. niger queens show a similar level of aggression towards both co-foundresses and intruders, indicating that they are unable of individual recognition, contrary to Pachycondyla. Additionally, the variation in chemical profiles of Lasius and Pachycondyla queens is comparable, thus informational constraints are unlikely to apply. We conclude that selection pressure from the social context is of crucial significance for the sophistication of recognition systems.",
  "Understanding social evolution requires us to understand the processes regulating the number of breeders within social groups and how they partition reproduction. Queens in polygynous (multiple queens per colony) ants often seek adoption in established colonies instead of founding a new colony independently. This mode of dispersal leads to potential conflicts, as kin selection theory predicts that resident workers should favour nestmate queens over foreign queens. Here we compared the survival of foreign and resident queens as well as their relative reproductive share. We used the ant Formica exsecta to construct colonies consisting of one queen with workers related to this resident queen and introduced a foreign queen. We found that the survival of foreign queens did not differ from that of resident queens over a period of 136 days. However, the genetic analyses revealed that resident queens produced a 1.5-fold higher number of offspring than introduced queens, and had an equal or higher share in 80% of the colonies. These data indicate that some discrimination can occur against dispersing individuals and that dispersal can thus have costs in terms of direct reproduction for dispersing queens.",
  "Caterpillars of the butterfly Maculinea rebeli develop as parasites inside ant colonies. In intensively studied French populations, about 25% of caterpillars mature within 1 year (fast-developing larvae [FDL]) and the others after 2 years (slow-developing larvae [SDL]); all available evidence indicates that this ratio is under the control of egg-laying females. We present an analytical model to predict the evolutionarily stable fraction of FDL (pESS). The model accounts for added winter mortality of SDL, general and kin competition among caterpillars, a competitive advantage of SDL over newly entering FDL (priority effect), and the avoidance of renewed infection of ant nests by butterflies in the coming season (segregation). We come to the following conclusions: (1) all factors listed above can promote the evolution of delayed development; (2) kin competition and segregation stabilize pESS near 0.5; and (3) a priority effect is the only mechanism potentially selecting for pESS < 0.5. However, given the empirical data, pESS is predicted to fall closer to 0.5 than to the 0.25 that has been observed. In this particular system, bet hedging cannot explain why more than 50% of larvae postpone growth. Presumably, other fitness benefits for SDL, for example, higher fertility or longevity, also contribute to the evolution of delayed development. The model presented here may be of general applicability for systems where maturing individuals compete in small subgroups.",
  "In a recent study, Denny et al. (2004a) showed that queens of the army ant, Eciton burchellii, mate with multiple males and presented estimates suggesting that they mate with more males than queens of any other ant species so far investigated. They also inferred that data were consistent with queens being inseminated repeatedly throughout their life, which would be exceptional among the social Hymenoptera and contradictory to predictions from kin selection theory. In the present study, we reanalyze these data using new software and supplement them with similar microsatellite data from other colonies of the same species. Mating frequencies in E. burchellii are indeed very high (mean observed and effective queen-mating frequencies of 12.9 each) but considerably lower than the previous estimates. We show that the number of patrilines represented in the first worker offspring of a young queen is lower than in older queens but suggest that this may be due to initial sperm clumping in the queen's sperm storage organ, rather than to repeated inseminations. Moreover, we found no evidence for repeated mating by genotyping sequential worker generations produced by a single old queen, showing that she did not obtain new inseminations despite ample opportunities for mating.",
  "Army ants have long been suspected to represent an independent origin of multiple queen-mating in the social Hymenoptera. Using microsatellite markers, we show that queens of the African army ant Dorylus (Anomma) molestus have the highest absolute (17.3) and effective (17.5) queen-mating frequencies reported so far for ants. This confirms that obligate multiple queen-mating in social insects is associated with large colony size and advanced social organization, but also raises several novel questions. First, these high estimates place army ants in the range of mating frequencies of honeybees, which have so far been regarded as odd exceptions within the social Hymenoptera. Army ants and honeybees are fundamentally different in morphology and life history, but are the only social insects known that combine obligate multiple mating with reproduction by colony fission and extremely male-biased sex ratios. This implies that the very high numbers of matings in both groups may be due partly to the relatively low costs of additional matings. Second, we were able to trace recent events of colony fission in four of the investigated colonies, where the genotypes of the two queens were only compatible with a mother-daughter relationship. A direct comparison of male production between colonies with offspring from one and two queens, respectively, suggested strongly that new queens do not produce a sexual brood until all workers of the old queen have died, which is consistent with kin selection theory.",
  "Variation in queen number alters the genetic structure of social insect colonies, which in turn affects patterns of kin-selected conflict and cooperation. Theory suggests that shifts from single- to multiple-queen colonies are often associated with other changes in the breeding system, such as higher queen turnover, more local mating, and restricted dispersal. These changes may restrict gene flow between the two types of colonies and it has been suggested that this might ultimately lead to sympatric speciation. We performed a detailed microsatellite analysis of a large population of the ant Formica selysi, which revealed extensive variation in social structure, with 71 colonies headed by a single queen and 41 by multiple queens. This polymorphism in social structure appeared stable over time, since little change in the number of queens per colony was detected over a five-year period. Apart from queen number, single- and multiple-queen colonies had very similar breeding systems. Queen turnover was absent or very low in both types of colonies. Single- and multiple-queen colonies exhibited very small but significant levels of inbreeding, which indicates a slight deviation from random mating at a local scale and suggests that a small proportion of queens mate with related males. For both types of colonies, there was very little genetic structuring above the level of the nest, with no sign of isolation by distance. These similarities in the breeding systems were associated with a complete lack of genetic differentiation between single- and multiple-queen colonies, which provides no support for the hypothesis that change in queen number leads to restricted gene flow between social forms. Overall, this study suggests that the higher rates of queen turnover, local mating, and population structuring that are often associated with multiple-queen colonies do not appear when single- and multiple-queen colonies still coexist within the same population, but build up over time in populations consisting mostly of multiple-queen colonies.",
  "Kin selection theory predicts that, in social Hymenoptera, the parentage of males should be determined by within-colony relatedness. We present a model showing that, when sex ratios are split (bimodal) as a function of colony kin structure, the predictions of kin selection theory regarding the occurrence of worker reproduction and policing (prevention of worker reproduction) require modification. To test the predictions of kin selection theory and our model, we estimated using microsatellites the frequency of worker-produced male eggs and adults in the facultatively polygynous (multiple-queen) ant Leptothorax acervorum. Analysis of 210 male eggs and 328 adult males from 13 monogynous (single-queen) and nine polygynous colonies demonstrated that the frequency of worker-produced males was low (2.3-4.6% of all males) and did not differ significantly between colony classes or between eggs and adults. This suggested workers' self-restraint as the cause of infrequent worker reproduction in both colony classes. Such an outcome is not predicted either by comparing relatedness values or by our model. Therefore, it appears that factors other than colony kin structure and sex ratio effects determine the pattern of male parentage in the study population. A likely factor is a colony-level cost of worker reproduction.",
  "Nepotism shapes interactions among the members of almost every animal society. However, clear evidence of nepotism within highly cooperative insect societies, such as ant, wasp and honeybee colonies, is rare. Recent empirical findings suggest that nepotism occurs within honeybee colonies where kin-selection theory most strongly predicts its existence: during the lethal queen-queen duels that determine which of several young queens will become the colony's next queen. In this study, I test whether worker bees act nepotistically by hindering duelling queens that are distantly related to themselves. I accomplished this by observing labelled workers harassing duelling queen bees in observation hives and subsequently by determining worker-queen relatedness using DNA microsatellites. I show that the workers that harassed duelling queens were neither more-closely nor more-distantly related to them than were workers selected randomly from the colony. Thus, workers did not behave nepotistically by hindering half-sister queens more than full-sister queens. These results demonstrate that under certain conditions, natural selection limits the evolution of nepotism within animal societies despite strong theoretical predictions for its existence.",
  "Split-sex-ratio theory assumes that conflict over whether to produce predominately males or female reproductives (gynes) is won by the workers in haplodiploid insect societies and the outcome is determined by colony kin structure. Tests of the theory have the potential to provide support for kin-selection theory and evidence of social conflict. We use natural variation in kinship among polygynous (multiple-queen) colonies of the ant Formica exsecta to study the associations between sex ratios and the relatedness of workers to female versus male brood (relatedness asymmetry). The population showed split sex ratios with about 89% of the colonies producing only males, resulting in an extremely male-biased investment ratio in the population. We make two important points with our data. First, we show that queen number may affect sex ratio independently of relatedness asymmetry. Colonies producing only males had greater genetic effective queen number but did not have greater relatedness asymmetry from the perspective of the adult workers that rear the brood. This lack of a difference in relatedness asymmetry between colonies producing females and those producing only males was associated with a generally low relatedness between workers and brood. Second, studies that suggest support for the relatedness-asymmetry hypothesis based on indirect measures of relatedness asymmetry (e.g. queen number estimated from relatedness data taken from the brood only) should be considered with caution. We propose a new hypothesis that explains split sex ratios in polygynous social insects based on the value of producing replacement queens.",
  "Newly mated queens of monogynous (single queen) ants usually found their colonies independently, without the assistance of workers. In polygynous (multiple queen) species queens are often adopted back into their natal nest and new colonies are established by budding. We report that the Australian 'living-fossil' ant, Nothomyrmecia macrops, is exceptional in that its single queen can be replaced by one of the colony's daughters. This type of colony founding is an interesting alternative reproductive strategy in monogynous ants, which maximizes fitness under kin selection. Successive queen replacement results in a series of reproductives over time (serial polygyny), making these colonies potentially immortal. Workers raise nieces and nephews (relatedness < or = 0.375) the year after queen replacement. Although N. macrops is 'primitive' in many other respects, colony inheritance is likely to be a derived specialization resulting from ecological constraints on solitary founding.",
  "Although multiple mating most likely increases mortality risk for social insect queens and lowers the kin benefits for nonreproductive workers, a significant proportion of hymenopteran queens mate with several males. It has been suggested that queens may mate multiply as a means to manipulate sex ratios to their advantage. Multiple paternity reduces the extreme relatedness value of females for workers, selecting for workers to invest more in males. In populations with female-biased sex ratios, queens heading such male-producing colonies would achieve a higher fitness. We tested this hypothesis in a Swiss and a Swedish population of the ant Lasius niger. There was substantial and consistent variation in queen mating frequency and colony sex allocation within and among populations, but no evidence that workers regulated sex allocation in response to queen mating frequency; the investment in females did not differ among paternity classes. Moreover, population-mean sex ratios were consistently less female biased than expected under worker control and were close to the queen optimum. Queens therefore had no incentive to manipulate sex ratios because their fitness did not depend on the sex ratio of their colony. Thus, we found no evidence that the sex-ratio manipulation theory can explain the evolution and maintenance of multiple mating in L. niger.",
  "Some ants have an extraordinary social organization, called unicoloniality, whereby individuals mix freely among physically separated nests. This type of social organization is not only a key attribute responsible for the ecological domination of these ants, but also an evolutionary paradox and a potential problem for kin selection theory because relatedness between nest mates is effectively zero. The introduction of the Argentine ant in Europe was apparently accompanied by a dramatic loss of inter-nest aggression and the formation of two immense supercolonies (which effectively are two unicolonial populations). Introduced populations experienced only limited loss of genetic diversity at neutral markers, indicating that the breakdown of recognition ability is unlikely to be merely due to a genetic bottleneck. Rather, we suggest that a \"genetic cleansing\" of recognition cues occurred after introduction. Indeed workers of the same supercolony are never aggressive to each other despite the large geographical distance and considerable genetic differentiation between sampling sites. By contrast, aggression is invariably extremely high between the two supercolonies, indicating that they have become fixed for different recognition alleles. The main supercolony, which ranges over 6,000 km from Italy to the Spanish Atlantic coast, effectively forms the largest cooperative unit ever recorded.",
  "Multiple mating by queens (polyandry) and the occurrence of multiple queens in the same colony (polygyny) alter patterns of relatedness within societies of eusocial insects. This is predicted to influence kin-selected conflicts over reproduction. We investigated the mating system of a facultatively polygynous UK population of the ant Leptothorax acervorum using up to six microsatellite loci. We estimated mating frequency by genotyping 79 dealate (colony) queens and the contents of their sperm receptacles and by detailed genetic analysis of 11 monogynous (single-queen) and nine polygynous colonies. Results indicated that 95% of queens were singly mated and 5% of queens were doubly mated. The corrected population mean mating frequency was 1.06. Parentage analysis of adults and brood in 17 colonies (10 monogynous, 7 polygynous) showed that female offspring attributable to each of 31 queens were full sisters, confirming that queens typically mate once. Inbreeding coefficients, queen-mate relatedness of zero and the low incidence of diploid males provided evidence that L. acervorum sexuals mate entirely or almost entirely at random. Males mated to queens in the same polygynous colony were not related to one another. Our data also confirmed that polygynous colonies contain queens that are related on average and that their workers had a mixed maternity. We conclude that the mating system of L. acervorum involves queens that mate near nests with unrelated males and then seek readoption by those nests, and queens that mate in mating aggregations away from nests, also with unrelated males.",
  "Kin selection theory predicts that social insects should perform selfish manipulations as a function of colony genetic structure. We describe a novel mechanism by which this occurs. First, we use microsatellite analyses to show that, in a population of the ant Leptothorax acervorum, workers' relatedness asymmetry (ratio of relatedness to females and relatedness to males) is significantly higher in monogynous (single-queen) colonies than in polygynous (multiple-queen) colonies. Workers rear mainly queens in monogynous colonies and males in polygynous colonies. Therefore, split sex ratios in this population are correlated with workers' relatedness asymmetry. Together with significant female bias in the population numerical and investment sex ratios, this finding strongly supports kin-selection theory. Second, by determining the primary sex ratio using microsatellite markers to sex eggs, we show that the ratio of male to female eggs is the same in both monogynous and polygynous colonies and equals the overall ratio of haploids (males) to diploids (queens and workers) among adults. In contrast to workers of species with selective destruction of male brood, L. acervorum workers therefore rear eggs randomly with respect to sex and must achieve their favoured sex ratios by selectively biasing the final caste (queen or worker) of developing females.",
  "Sex allocation data in social Hymenoptera provide some of the best tests of kin selection, parent-offspring conflict and sex ratio theories. However, these studies critically depend on controlling for confounding ecological factors and on identifying all parties that potentially manipulate colony sex ratio. It has been suggested that maternally inherited parasites may influence sex allocation in social Hymenoptera. If the parasites can influence sex allocation, infected colonies are predicted to invest more resources in females than non-infected colonies, because the parasites are transmitted through females but not males. Prime candidates for such sex ratio manipulation are Wolbachia, because these cytoplasmically transmitted bacteria have been shown to affect the sex ratio of host arthropods by cytoplasmic incompatibility, parthenogenesis, male-killing and feminization. In this study, we tested whether Wolbachia infection is associated with colony sex ratio in two populations of the ant Formica exsecta that have been the subject of extensive sex ratio studies. In these populations colonies specialize in the production of one sex or the other. We found that almost all F. exsecta colonies in both populations are infected with Wolbachia. However, in neither population did we find a significant association in the predicted direction between the prevalence of Wolbachia and colony sex ratio. In particular, colonies with a higher proportion of infected workers did not produce more females. Hence, we conclude that Wolbachia does not seem to alter the sex ratio of its hosts as a means to increase transmission rate in these two populations of ants.",
  "Introduced species often possess low levels of genetic diversity relative to source populations as a consequence of the small population sizes associated with founder events. Additionally, native and introduced populations of the same species can possess divergent genetic structuring at both large and small geographic scales. Thus, genetic systems that have evolved in the context of high diversity may function quite differently in genetically homogeneous introduced populations. Here we conduct a genetic analysis of native and introduced populations of the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) in which we show that the population-level changes that have occurred during introduction have produced marked changes in the social structure of this species. Native populations of the Argentine ant are characterized by a pattern of genetic isolation by distance, whereas this pattern is absent in introduced populations. These differences appear to arise both from the effects of recent range expansion in the introduced range as well as from differences in gene flow within each range. Relatedness within nests and colonies is lower in the introduced range than in the native range as a consequence of the widespread genetic similarity that typifies introduced populations. In contrast, nestmates and colony-mates in the native range are more closely related, and local genetic differentiation is evident. Our results shed light on the problem posed for kin selection theory by the low levels of relatedness that are characteristic of many unicolonial species and suggest that the loss of genetic variation may be a common mechanism for the transition to a unicolonial colony structure.",
  "Despite the severe ecological and economic damage caused by introduced species, factors that allow invaders to become successful often remain elusive. Of invasive taxa, ants are among the most widespread and harmful. Highly invasive ants are often unicolonial, forming supercolonies in which workers and queens mix freely among physically separate nests. By reducing costs associated with territoriality, unicolonial species can attain high worker densities, allowing them to achieve interspecific dominance. Here we examine the behavior and population genetics of the invasive Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) in its native and introduced ranges, and we provide a mechanism to explain its success as an invader. Using microsatellite markers, we show that a population bottleneck has reduced the genetic diversity of introduced populations. This loss is associated with reduced intraspecific aggression among spatially separate nests, and leads to the formation of interspecifically dominant supercolonies. In contrast, native populations are more genetically variable and exhibit pronounced intraspecific aggression. Although reductions in genetic diversity are generally considered detrimental, these findings provide an example of how a genetic bottleneck can lead to widespread ecological success. In addition, these results provide insights into the origin and evolution of unicoloniality, which is often considered a challenge to kin selection theory.",
  "Social insects present many phenomena seen in all organisms but in more extreme forms and with larger sample sizes than those observable in most natural populations of vertebrates. Microsatellites are proving very much more informative than allozymes for the analysis of population biological problems, and prolifically polymorphic markers are fairly readily developed. In addition, the male-haploid genetic system of many social insects facilitates genetic analysis. The ability to amplify DNA from sperm stored in a female's sperm storage device enables the determination of mating types long after the death of the short-lived males, in addition to information on the degree of mixing of sperm from different males. Mitochondrial (mt) DNA sequences are also proving important, not only in phylogenetic studies but also in molecular population genetics, as a tracer of female movements. Mitochondrial markers have definitively shown the movement of females between colonies, challenging models giving exclusive primacy to kin selection as the explanation for multiqueen colonies, in Australian meat ants, Iridomyrmex purpureus, and the aridzone queenless ant Rhytidoponera sp. 12. Microsatellite and mtDNA variation are being studied in Camponotus consobrinus sugar ants, showing an unexpected diversity of complexity in colony structure, and microsatellites have shown that transfer of ants between nests of the weaver ant Polyrhachis doddi must be slight, despite an apparent lack of hostility.",
  "Mathematical biologists have failed to produce a satisfactory general model for evolution of altruism, i.e., of behaviors by which \"altruists\" benefit other individuals but not themselves; kin selection does not seem to be a sufficient explanation of nonreciprocal altruism. Nonmathematical (but mathematically acceptable) models are now proposed for evolution of negative altruism in dual-determinant and of positive altruism in tri-determinant systems. Peck orders, territorial systems, and an ant society are analyzed as examples. In all models, evolution is primarily by individual selection, probably supplemented by group selection. Group selection is differential extinction of populations. It can act only on populations preformed by selection at the individual level, but can either cancel individual selective trends (effecting evolutionary homeostasis) or supplement them; its supplementary effect is probably increasingly important in the evolution of increasingly organized populations.",
  "One of the central questions of ageing research is why lifespans of organisms differ so tremendously among related taxa and, even more surprising, among members of the same species. Social insects provide a particularly pronounced example for this. Here, we review previously published information on lifespan plasticity in social insects and provide new data on worker lifespan in the ant Cardiocondyla obscurior, which because of its relatively short lifespan is a convenient model to study ageing. We show that individual lifespan may vary within species with several reproductive and social traits, such as egg-laying rate, queen number, task, colony size and colony composition. For example, in Cardiocondyla, highly fecund queens live longer than reproductively less active queens, and workers tend to live longer when transferred into a novel social environment or, as we show with new data, into small colonies. We hypothesize that this plasticity of lifespan serves to maximize the reproductive output of the colony as a whole and thus the inclusive fitness of all individuals. The underlying mechanisms that link the social environment or reproductive status with lifespan are currently unresolved. Several studies in honeybees and ants indicate an involvement of nutrient-sensing pathways, but the details appear to differ among species. This article is part of the theme issue 'Ageing and sociality: why, when and how does sociality change ageing patterns?'",
  "Hamilton's theory of inclusive fitness suggests that helpers in animal societies gain fitness indirectly by increasing the reproductive performance of a related beneficiary. Helpers in cooperatively breeding birds, mammals and primitively eusocial wasps may additionally obtain direct fitness through inheriting the nest or mating partner of the former reproductive. Here, we show that also workers of a highly eusocial ant may achieve considerable direct fitness by producing males in both queenless and queenright colonies. We investigated the reproductive success of workers of the ant Temnothorax crassispinus in nature and the laboratory by dissecting workers and determining the origin of males by microsatellite analysis. We show that workers are capable of activating their ovaries and successfully producing their sons independently of the presence of a queen. Genotypes revealed that at least one fifth of the males in natural queenright colonies were not offspring of the queen. Most worker-produced males could be assigned to workers that were unrelated to the queen, suggesting egg-laying by drifting workers.",
  "BACKGROUND: Reproductive division of labor is one of the key features of social insects. Queens are adapted for reproduction while workers are adapted for foraging and colony maintenance. In many species, however, workers retain functional ovaries and can lay unfertilized male eggs or trophic eggs. Here we report for the first time on the occurrence of physogastric workers and apparent worker reproduction in the invasive yellow crazy ant Anoplolepis gracilipes (Fr. Smith). We further examined the reproductive potential and nutritional role of physogastric workers through multidisciplinary approaches including morphological characterization, laboratory manipulation, genetic analysis and behavioral observation. RESULTS: Egg production with two types of eggs, namely reproductive and trophic eggs, by physogastric workers was found. The reproductive egg was confirmed to be haploid and male-destined, suggesting that the workers produced males via arrhenotokous parthenogenesis as no spermatheca was discovered. Detailed observations suggested that larvae were mainly fed with trophic eggs. Along with consumption of trophic eggs by queens and other castes as part of their diet, the vital role of physogastric workers as \"trophic specialist\" is confirmed. CONCLUSION: We propose that adaptive advantages derived from worker reproduction for A. gracilipes may include 1) trophic eggs provisioned by physogastric workers likely assist colonies of A. gracilipes in overcoming unfavorable conditions such as paucity of food during critical founding stage; 2) worker-produced males are fertile and thus might offer an inclusive fitness advantage for the doomed orphaned colony.",
  "Eusociality is one of the most complex forms of social organization, characterized by cooperative and reproductive units termed colonies. Altruistic behavior of workers within colonies is explained by inclusive fitness, with indirect fitness benefits accrued by helping kin. Members of a social insect colony are expected to be more closely related to one another than they are to other conspecifics. In many social insects, the colony can extend to multiple socially connected but spatially separate nests (polydomy). Social connections, such as trails between nests, promote cooperation and resource exchange, and we predict that workers from socially connected nests will have higher internest relatedness than those from socially unconnected, and noncooperating, nests. We measure social connections, resource exchange, and internest genetic relatedness in the polydomous wood ant Formica lugubris to test whether (1) socially connected but spatially separate nests cooperate, and (2) high internest relatedness is the underlying driver of this cooperation. Our results show that socially connected nests exhibit movement of workers and resources, which suggests they do cooperate, whereas unconnected nests do not. However, we find no difference in internest genetic relatedness between socially connected and unconnected nest pairs, both show high kinship. Our results suggest that neighboring pairs of connected nests show a social and cooperative distinction, but no genetic distinction. We hypothesize that the loss of a social connection may initiate ecological divergence within colonies. Genetic divergence between neighboring nests may build up only later, as a consequence rather than a cause of colony separation.",
  "Division of labour is central to the ecological success of eusocial insects, yet the evolutionary factors driving increases in complexity in division of labour are little known. The size-complexity hypothesis proposes that, as larger colonies evolve, both non-reproductive and reproductive division of labour become more complex as workers and queens act to maximize inclusive fitness. Using a statistically robust phylogenetic comparative analysis of social and environmental traits of species within the ant tribe Attini, we show that colony size is positively related to both non-reproductive (worker size variation) and reproductive (queen-worker dimorphism) division of labour. The results also suggested that colony size acts on non-reproductive and reproductive division of labour in different ways. Environmental factors, including measures of variation in temperature and precipitation, had no significant effects on any division of labour measure or colony size. Overall, these results support the size-complexity hypothesis for the evolution of social complexity and division of labour in eusocial insects. Determining the evolutionary drivers of colony size may help contribute to our understanding of the evolution of social complexity.",
  "The genetic origin of advanced social organization has long been one of the outstanding problems of evolutionary biology. Here we present an analysis of the major steps in ant evolution, based for the first time, to our knowledge, on combined recent advances in paleontology, phylogeny, and the study of contemporary life histories. We provide evidence of the causal forces of natural selection shaping several key phenomena: (i) the relative lateness and rarity in geological time of the emergence of eusociality in ants and other animal phylads; (ii) the prevalence of monogamy at the time of evolutionary origin; and (iii) the female-biased sex allocation observed in many ant species. We argue that a clear understanding of the evolution of social insects can emerge if, in addition to relatedness-based arguments, we take into account key factors of natural history and study how natural selection acts on alleles that modify social behavior.",
  "According to the inclusive fitness theory, some degree of positive relatedness is required for the evolution and maintenance of altruism. However, ant colonies are sometimes large interconnected networks of nests, which are genetically homogenous entities, causing a putative problem for the theory. We studied spatial structure and genetic relatedness in two supercolonies of the ant Formica exsecta, using nuclear and mitochondrial markers. We show that there may be multiple pathways to supercolonial social organization leading to different spatial genetic structures. One supercolony formed a genetically homogenous population dominated by a single mtDNA haplotype, as expected if founded by a small number of colonizers, followed by nest propagation by budding and domination of the habitat patch. The other supercolony had several haplotypes, and the spatial genetic structure was a mosaic of nuclear and mitochondrial clusters. Genetic diversity probably originated from long-range dispersal, and the mosaic population structure is likely a result of stochastic short-range dispersal of individuals. Such a mosaic spatial structure is apparently discordant with the current knowledge about the integrity of ant colonies. Relatedness was low in both populations when estimated among nestmates, but increased significantly when estimated among individuals sharing the same genetic cluster or haplogroup. The latter association indicates the important historical role of queen dispersal in the determination of the spatial genetic structure.",
  "Parasites represent a severe threat to social insects, which form high-density colonies of related individuals, and selection should favour host traits that reduce infection risk. Here, using a carpenter ant (Camponotus aethiops) and a generalist insect pathogenic fungus (Metarhizium brunneum), we show that infected ants radically change their behaviour over time to reduce the risk of colony infection. Infected individuals (i) performed less social interactions than their uninfected counterparts, (ii) did not interact with brood anymore and (iii) spent most of their time outside the nest from day 3 post-infection until death. Furthermore, infected ants displayed an increased aggressiveness towards non-nestmates. Finally, infected ants did not alter their cuticular chemical profile, suggesting that infected individuals do not signal their physiological status to nestmates. Our results provide evidence for the evolution of unsociability following pathogen infection in a social animal and suggest an important role of inclusive fitness in driving such evolution.",
  "Split sex ratio theory predicts that when kin structure varies among colonies of social insects, in order to maximize the inclusive fitness, colonies with relatively high sister-sister relatedness should specialize in producing reproductive females, whereas in those with relatively low sister-sister relatedness workers should bias their sex ratio towards males. However, in order to achieve this, workers need to be able to reliably assess the type of colony in which they live. The information on colony kin structure may be encoded in cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs), assuming that genetic variability translates accurately into chemical variability. However, in genetically heterogeneous colonies, too accurate information may encourage the pursuit of individual interests through nepotistic behavior and reduce colony efficiency or cause social disruption. In this study, we estimated how well variability of CHC recognition cues reflects colony kin structure in the ant Formica exsecta. Our results show that CHC variability does not covary with kin structure or the overall genetic diversity of the colony, and that patrilines and matrilines can have distinct CHC profiles in some but not all colonies. However, within-colony relatedness remains the key determinant of colony sex ratios. Based on our results, CHC variability cannot serve as accurate information on within-colony relatedness, kin structure, or full-sib affiliation, nor do workers seem to use colony CHC variability as a proxy for sex-ratio adjustment. The use of this type of information thus could lead workers to make mistakes, and it remains unclear how colonies of Formica exsecta adjust offspring sex ratio to their optimal value.",
  "Cohesion of social groups requires the suppression of individual selfishness. Indeed, worker egg laying in insect societies is usually suppressed or punished through aggression and egg removal. The effectiveness of such \"policing\" is expected to increase with decreasing relatedness, as inclusive fitness of group members is more strongly affected by selfish worker reproduction when group members are less closely related to each other. As inclusive fitness is also influenced by the costs and benefits of helping, the effectiveness of policing should decrease with increasing colony size, because the costs for the whole colony from selfish worker reproduction are proportionally reduced in large groups. Here, we show that policing effectiveness in colonies of the ant Temnothorax unifasciatus is low in large groups and high in small groups when relatedness is high. When we experimentally decreased the relatedness in groups, the policing effectiveness reached the same high level as in small, highly related groups, irrespective of group size. Therefore, our results indicate that policing effectiveness is simultaneously shaped by relatedness and group size, that is, an ecological factor. This may have major implications for testing policing across species of animals.",
  "BACKGROUND: Mutual policing is an important mechanism for reducing conflict in cooperative groups. In societies of ants, bees, and wasps, mutual policing of worker reproduction can evolve when workers are more closely related to the queen's sons than to the sons of workers or when the costs of worker reproduction lower the inclusive fitness of workers. During colony growth, relatedness within the colony remains the same, but the costs of worker reproduction may change. The costs of worker reproduction are predicted to be greatest in incipient colonies. If the costs associated with worker reproduction outweigh the individual direct benefits to workers, policing mechanisms as found in larger colonies may be absent in incipient colonies. RESULTS: We investigated policing behaviour across colony growth in the ant Camponotus floridanus. In large colonies of this species, worker reproduction is policed by the destruction of worker-laid eggs. We found workers from incipient colonies do not exhibit policing behaviour, and instead tolerate all conspecific eggs. The change in policing behaviour is consistent with changes in egg surface hydrocarbons, which provide the informational basis for policing; eggs laid by queens from incipient colonies lack the characteristic hydrocarbons on the surface of eggs laid by queens from large colonies, making them chemically indistinguishable from worker-laid eggs. We also tested the response to fertility information in the context of queen tolerance. Workers from incipient colonies attacked foreign queens from large colonies; whereas workers from large colonies tolerated such queens. Workers from both incipient and large colonies attacked foreign queens from incipient colonies. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide novel insights into the regulation of worker reproduction in social insects at both the proximate and ultimate levels. At the proximate level, our results show that mechanisms of social regulation, such as the response to fertility signals, change dramatically over a colony's life cycle. At the ultimate level, our results emphasize the importance of factors besides relatedness in predicting the level of conflict within a colony. Our results also suggest policing may not be an important regulatory force at every stage of colony development. Changes relating to the life cycle of the colony are sufficient to account for major differences in social regulation in an insect colony. Mechanisms of conflict mediation observed in one phase of a social group's development cannot be generalized to all stages.",
  "Animal societies provide perfect conditions for the spread of infections and are therefore expected to employ mechanisms that reduce the probability of transmitting pathogens to group members [1-4]. Death in nature rarely results from old age but commonly results from diseases. Leaving one's group to die in seclusion might be an efficient way of minimizing the risk of infecting kin. Anecdotal observations of moribund individuals deserting from their groups exist for several species, including humans (e.g., [5]), but have rarely been substantiated by quantitative analysis. Furthermore, to confirm that dying in solitude has evolved because of its altruistic benefits requires refuting the alternative explanation of pathogen manipulation of host behavior. Here we show that workers of the ant Temnothorax unifasciatus dying from fungal infection, uninfected workers whose life expectancy was reduced by exposure to 95% CO(2)[6, 7], and workers dying spontaneously in observation colonies exhibited the same suite of behavior of isolating themselves from their nestmates days or hours before death. Actively leaving the nest and breaking off all social interactions thus occurred regardless of whether individuals were infected or not. Social withdrawal might be a commonly overlooked altruistic trait serving the inclusive fitness interests of dying individuals in social animals.",
  "Theory predicts that altruism is only evolutionarily stable if it is preferentially directed towards relatives, so that any such behaviour towards seemingly unrelated individuals requires scrutiny. Queenless army ant colonies, which have anecdotally been reported to fuse with queenright foreign colonies, are such an enigmatic case. Here we combine experimental queen removal with population genetics and cuticular chemistry analyses to show that colonies of the African army ant Dorylus molestus frequently merge with neighbouring colonies after queen loss. Merging colonies often have no direct co-ancestry, but are on average probably distantly related because of overall population viscosity. The alternative of male production by orphaned workers appears to be so inefficient that residual inclusive fitness of orphaned workers might be maximized by indiscriminately merging with neighbouring colonies to increase their reproductive success. We show that worker chemical recognition profiles remain similar after queen loss, but rapidly change into a mixed colony Gestalt odour after fusion, consistent with indiscriminate acceptance of alien workers that are no longer aggressive. We hypothesize that colony fusion after queen loss might be more widespread, especially in spatially structured populations of social insects where worker reproduction is not profitable.",
  "In ant-plant protection mutualisms, plants provide nesting space and nutrition to defending ants. Several plant-ants are polygynous. Possessing more than one queen per colony can reduce nestmate relatedness and consequently the inclusive fitness of workers. Here, we investigated the colony structure of the obligate acacia-ant Pseudomyrmex peperi, which competes for nesting space with several congeneric and sympatric species. Pseudomyrmex peperi had a lower colony founding success than its congeners and thus, appears to be competitively inferior during the early stages of colony development. Aggression assays showed that P. peperi establishes distinct, but highly polygynous supercolonies, which can inhabit large clusters of host trees. Analysing queens, workers, males and virgin queens from two supercolonies with eight polymorphic microsatellite markers revealed a maximum of three alleles per locus within a colony and, thus, high relatedness among nestmates. Colonies had probably been founded by one singly mated queen and supercolonies resulted from intranidal mating among colony-derived males and daughter queens. This strategy allows colonies to grow by budding and to occupy individual plant clusters for time spans that are longer than an individual queen's life. Ancestral states reconstruction indicated that polygyny represents the derived state within obligate acacia-ants. We suggest that the extreme polygyny of Pseudomyrmex peperi, which is achieved by intranidal mating and thereby maintains high nestmate relatedness, might play an important role for species coexistence in a dynamic and competitive habitat.",
  "Studies on sex ratios in social insects provide among the most compelling evidence for the importance of kin selection in social evolution. The elegant synthesis of Fisher's sex ratio principle and Hamilton's inclusive fitness theory predicts that colony-level sex ratios vary with the colonies' social and genetic structures. Numerous empirical studies in ants, bees, and wasps have corroborated these predictions. However, the evolutionary optimization of sex ratios requires genetic variation, but one fundamental determinant of sex ratios - the propensity of female larvae to develop into young queens or workers (\"queen bias\") - is thought to be largely controlled by the environment. Evidence for a genetic influence on sex ratio and queen bias is as yet restricted to a few taxa, in particular hybrids.Because of the very short lifetime of their queens, ants of the genus Cardiocondyla are ideal model systems for the study of complete lifetime reproductive success, queen bias, and sex ratios. We found that lifetime sex ratios of the ant Cardiocondyla kagutsuchi have a heritable component. In experimental single-queen colonies, 22 queens from a genetic lineage with a highly female-biased sex ratio produced significantly more female-biased offspring sex ratios than 16 queens from a lineage with a more male-biased sex ratio (median 91.5% vs. 58.5% female sexuals). Sex ratio variation resulted from different likelihood of female larvae developing into sexuals (median 50% vs. 22.6% female sexuals) even when uniformly nursed by workers from another colony.Consistent differences in lifetime sex ratios and queen bias among queens of C. kagutsuchi suggest that heritable, genetic or maternal effects strongly affect caste determination. Such variation might provide the basis for adaptive evolution of queen and worker strategies, though it momentarily constrains the power of workers and queens to optimize caste ratios.",
  "In social Hymenoptera, within-colony relatedness is usually high due to the haplodiploid sex-determining system. However, factors such as the presence of multiple reproductive queens (polygyny), multiple queen matings (polyandry) or worker reproduction result in decreased relatedness among workers and the brood they rear, and consequently dilute their inclusive fitness benefits from helping. Here, we investigated population genetic structure, mating system, worker reproduction and parthenogenesis in the desert ant Cataglyphis sabulosa. Analysis of worker genotypes showed that colonies are headed by a single queen, mated with 1-5 males. The inbreeding coefficient within colonies and the levels of relatedness between the queens and their mates were positive, indicating that mating occurs between related individuals. Moreover, the mates of a queen are on average related and contribute equally to worker production. Our analyses also indicate that colonies are genetically differentiated and form a population exhibiting no isolation-by-distance pattern, consistent with the independent foundation of new colonies (that is, without the help of workers). Finally, both ovarian dissections and genetic data on the parentage of males show that workers do not reproduce in queenright colonies; however, they lay both haploid (arrhenotokous males) and diploid (thelytokous females) eggs in queenless colonies. In contrast to the congeneric species C. cursor, where new queens are produced by thelytokous parthenogenesis, female sexuals of C. sabulosa result from classical sexual reproduction.",
  "Workers of the ant Temnothorax nylanderi form dominance orders in orphaned colonies in which only one or a few top-ranking workers begin to produce males from unfertilized eggs. Between one and 11 individuals initiated 80% of all aggression in 14 queenless colonies. As predicted from inclusive fitness models (Molet M, van Baalen M, Monnin T, Insectes Soc 52:247-256, 2005), hierarchy length was found to first increase with colony size and then to level off at larger worker numbers. The frequency and skew of aggression decreased with increasing size, indicating that rank orders are less pronounced in larger colonies.",
  "The theory of inclusive fitness provides a powerful explanation for reproductive altruism in social insects, whereby workers gain inclusive fitness benefit by rearing the brood of related queens. Some ant species, however, have unicolonial population structures where multiple nests, each containing numerous queens, are interconnected and individuals move freely between nests. In such cases, nestmate relatedness values may often be indistinguishable from zero, which is problematic for inclusive fitness-based explanations of reproductive altruism. We conducted a detailed population genetic study in the polygynous ant Formica exsecta, which has been suggested to form unicolonial populations in its native habitat. Analyses based on adult workers indeed confirmed a genetic structuring consistent with a unicolonial population structure. However, at the population level the genetic structuring inferred from worker pupae was not consistent with a unicolonial population structure, but rather suggested a multicolonial population structure of extended family-based nests. These contrasting patterns suggest limited queen dispersal and free adult worker dispersal. That workers indeed disperse as adults was confirmed by mark-recapture measures showing consistent worker movement between nests. Together, these findings describe a new form of social organization, which possibly also characterizes other ant species forming unicolonial populations in their native habitats. Moreover, the genetic analyses also revealed that while worker nestmate relatedness was indistinguishable from zero at a small geographical scale, it was significantly positive at the population level. This highlights the need to consider the relevant geographical scale when investigating the role of inclusive fitness as a selective force maintaining reproductive altruism.",
  "BACKGROUND: Males of many species adjust their reproductive tactics with regard to their condition and status. For example, large males may develop weapons and fight for access to females, whereas small or undernourished males do not express costly weapons or ornaments and sneak copulations. Different condition-dependent reproductive tactics may be associated with unequal average fitness, but the tactic chosen by a given male under given circumstances is thought to result in the highest possible fitness return. The ant species Cardiocondyla obscurior exhibits an environment-controlled polymorphism of docile, winged males and aggressive \"ergatoid\" males. Ergatoid males, which can replenish their sperm supply throughout their lives, engage in lethal fighting, and attempt to monopolize all female sexuals available in their nests, were previously assumed to gain higher lifetime reproductive success than the peaceful, winged males, which disperse to mate away from the nest and whose spermatogenesis is limited to the first days of adult life. However, precise data on male mating success have as yet not been available.Here, we compare the average mating success of the two male morphs, taking the high mortality rate of immature ergatoid males into account. Because individuals in insect societies may have opposing interests about their own development, we also investigate whether the interests of male larvae coincide with those of the workers and the rest of the society. RESULTS: When the survival probability of males is taken into account, winged males are more likely to mate multiply and in consequence have a higher estimated average mating success than ergatoid males. Therefore, male larvae are expected to prefer developing into winged instead of ergatoid adults. CONCLUSION: Though male larvae can expect a higher average mating success when developing into winged males, most colonies produce only ergatoid males under standard conditions. This might point at a novel type of potential kin conflict within the social insect colony. Because workers in insect societies usually control male larval development, ergatoid male production under normal conditions probably reflects the optimal allocation strategy of workers to maximise their inclusive fitness.",
  "In social insects, colonies may contain multiple reproductively active queens. This leads to potential conflicts over the apportionment of brood maternity, especially with respect to the production of reproductive offspring. We investigated reproductive partitioning in offspring females (gynes) and workers in the ant Formica fusca, and combined this information with data on the genetic returns gained by workers. Our results provide the first evidence that differential reproductive partitioning among breeders can enhance the inclusive fitness returns for sterile individuals that tend non-descendant offspring. Two aspects of reproductive partitioning contribute to this outcome. First, significantly fewer mother queens contribute to gyne (new reproductive females) than to worker brood, such that relatedness increases from worker to gyne brood. Second, and more importantly, adult workers were significantly more related to the reproductive brood raised by the colony, than to the contemporary worker brood. Thus, the observed breeder shift leads to genetic benefits for the adult workers that tend the brood. Our results also have repercussions for genetic population analyses. Given the observed pattern of reproductive partitioning, estimates of effective population size based on worker and gyne samples are not interchangeable.",
  "In animal societies, cooperation for the common wealth and latent conflicts due to the selfish interests of individuals are in delicate balance. In many ant species, colonies contain multiple breeders and workers interact with nestmates of varying degrees of relatedness. Therefore, workers could increase their inclusive fitness by preferentially caring for their closest relatives, yet evidence for nepotism in insect societies remains scarce and controversial. We experimentally demonstrate that workers of the ant Formica exsecta do not discriminate between highly related and unrelated brood, but that brood viability differs between queens. We further show that differences in brood viability are sufficient to explain a relatedness pattern that has previously been interpreted as evidence for nepotism. Hence, our findings support the view that nepotism remains elusive in social insects and emphasize the need for further controlled experiments.",
  "In most social insects workers do not mate, but have retained the ability to produce haploid eggs that can develop into viable male offspring. Under what circumstances this reproductive potential is realized and how the ensuing worker-queen conflict over male production is resolved, is an area of active research in insect sociobiology. Here we present microsatellite data for 176 males from eight colonies of the African army ant Dorylus (Anomma) molestus. Comparison with worker genotypes and inferred queen genotypes from the same colonies show that workers do not or at best very rarely reproduce in the presence of the queen. Queens of D. (A.) molestus are known to be highly multiply mated. This implies that workers are on average more closely related to queen sons than to other workers' sons, so that our results are consistent with predictions from inclusive fitness theory. It remains unknown, however, whether worker sterility is maintained by active worker policing or by self-restraint.",
  "Queens of some species of social insects form dominance hierarchies in which only the top-ranking individual reproduces. Such unequal partitioning of reproduction can be stable when subordinate queens increase their inclusive fitness indirectly by helping to rear a related dominant queen's offspring. We investigated whether subordinate queens of the ant, Leptothorax gredleri, affect the reproductive success of the dominant queen. In laboratory colonies with two queens, first eggs were laid approximately 20 days later than in colonies with a single queen, presumably due to aggressive competition among nestmate queens. Nevertheless, two-queen colonies produced on average more brood than one-queen colonies, although egg laying was completely or almost completely monopolized by one single queen. The presence of a subordinate queen therefore appears to increase the productivity of the dominant.",
  "In group-living animals, mutual policing to suppress reproduction is an important mechanism in the resolution of conflict between selfish group members and the group as a whole. In societies of bees, ants, and wasps, policing against the production of males by other workers is expected when egg laying by workers decreases the average inclusive fitness of individual group members. This may result (i) from the relatedness of workers being lower to worker than to queen-derived males or (ii) from a lowered overall colony efficiency. Whereas good evidence exists for policing behavior caused by genetic conflicts, policing caused by efficiency factors has not been demonstrated. We investigated the regulation of reproduction in the ant Platythyrea punctata, a species in which colonies are clones because workers are capable of producing female offspring by thelytokous parthenogenesis. Reproductive conflicts resulting from differences in genetic relatedness are therefore not expected, but uncontrolled reproduction by all workers could lead to the destruction of sociality. Here we show that worker policing by aggressive attacks against additionally reproducing workers keeps the number of reproducing workers low. Furthermore, through experimental manipulation of the number of brood items per colony, we show that worker policing can enhance group efficiency.",
  "Workers of the ant Formica truncorum specialize in rearing females or males depending on the number of fathers of a colony. These split sex ratios increase inclusive fitness, but it has remained unknown how workers assess the number of patrilines in their colonies and to what extent their reproductive decisions are constrained by lack of information. By analysis of the quantitative variation in cuticular hydrocarbon profiles of workers of multiply mated queens, we show that the heritable component of recognition cues is low and that the extent of sex ratio biasing toward males is correlated with patriline differences in hydrocarbon profiles. Workers are thus able to capitalize on colony-level relatedness asymmetry, but their inclusive fitness is constrained by uninformative recognition cues. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the occasional expression of nepotistic phenotypes favoring full-sisters over half-sisters maintains selection against informative recognition cues. We evaluate how inclusive fitness theory may be used to predict the number and kind of recognition cues in insect societies of a specific relatedness structure.",
  "The literature on sex ratio evolution in ant colonies is dominated by inclusive fitness arguments. In general, genetic theory makes good predictions about sexual investment in ant populations, but understanding colony-level variance in sex investment ratios has proven more difficult. Recently, however, more studies have addressed ecological factors that influence colony-level sex investment ratios. Food availability, in particular, has been manipulated because larval nutrition influences female caste determination, thus implying that resource availability should be of critical importance for colony sex investment ratios. However, results from food supplementation experiments are equivocal, and it is clear that ant colony response to food supplementation is dependent on the ecological background of the population. We presented field colonies of the ant Myrmica brevispinosa with two food types (proteins and carbohydrates), and assessed their relative impact on colony-level sex investment ratios. We show that colonies receiving carbohydrate enhancement invested in more female sexuals and produced more female-biased sex allocation ratios than protein-fed or control colonies. Thus, our study is the first, to our knowledge, to demonstrate that sex ratios in social insect colonies might be sensitive to resource quality. Male investment was not influenced by food treatment, but was positively correlated with colony size. Therefore, the shift in sex ratios in our study must have been mediated through nutritional influences on female caste determination rather than male brood elimination. We also used our data to evaluate evidence for sex ratio compensation by queenright colonies in response to male production by workers from orphaned colonies.",
  "The potential role of haplodiploid sex determination in promoting the evolution of altruism and eusociality has been the subject of intense debate for over 50 y. Different theoretical models have suggested that haplodiploidy influences relatedness in a way that either does or does not make it easier for altruism to evolve. This debate over the \"haplodiploidy hypothesis\" can only be resolved with a decisive empirical test that controls for potential phylogenetic bias. Here we critically examine the current state of evidence for an adaptive link between haplodiploidy and eusociality, applying phylogenetically informed methods to ensure that statistical tests reflect independent evolutionary transitions. Using data from 5,678 species, across all major insect orders, we find no evidence that haplodiploidy favors an increased rate of eusocial evolution. We show that this result is robust to: a) different analytical approaches; b) alternative ways of defining both eusociality and haplodiploidy; and c) uncertainty in eusociality assignments. Our analyses suggest that previously reported associations between haplodiploidy and eusociality are likely to have been artifacts, false-positive results primarily driven by a high transition rate to eusociality within the Hymenoptera. This high transition rate could be explained by any factor associated with that group, such as parental care, monogamy, or the possession of a powerful sting.",
  "Sex determination is a developmental switch that triggers sex-specific developmental programs. This switch is 'flipped' by the expression of genes that promote male- or female-specific development. Many lineages have evolved sex chromosomes that act as primary signals for sex determination. However, haplodiploidy (males are haploid and females are diploid), which occurs in ca. 12% of animal species, is incompatible with sex chromosomes. Haplodiploid taxa must, therefore, rely on other strategies for sex determination. One mechanism, 'complementary sex determination' (CSD), uses heterozygosity as a proxy for diploidy. In CSD, heterozygosity at a sex determination locus triggers female development, while hemizygosity or homozygosity permits male development. CSD loci have been mapped in honeybees and two ant species, but we know little about their evolutionary history. Here, we investigate sex determination in the clonal raider ant, Ooceraea biroi. We identified a 46 kb candidate CSD locus at which all females are heterozygous, but most diploid males are homozygous for either allele. As expected for CSD loci, the candidate locus has more alleles than most other loci, resulting in a peak of nucleotide diversity. This peak negligibly affects the amino acid sequences of protein-coding genes, suggesting that heterozygosity of a non-coding genomic sequence triggers female development. This locus is distinct from the CSD locus in honeybees but homologous to a CSD locus mapped in two distantly related ant species, implying that this molecular mechanism has been conserved since a common ancestor that lived approximately 112 million years ago. In most animals, sex is determined at conception. The factors that determine whether an embryo becomes male or female vary across animals, one example being sex chromosomes. In humans and other mammals, a gene on the Y chromosome triggers male development, whereas its absence allows female development. A different system occurs in haplodiploid species, including wasps, bees and ants. In these animals, haploid eggs (which inherit one set of each chromosome from their mother) develop into males, while diploid eggs (which inherit two sets of chromosomes, one from each parent) develop into females. In many haplodiploid species, inbreeding can produce diploid males, leading to the idea of a system called complementary sex determination, in which having two different versions of a certain gene produces a female while having two identical versions (homozygous diploids) or just one version produces a male. So far, genes or candidate genes responsible for this type of development have only been identified in honeybees and two ant species. Lacy et al. studied the clonal raider ant, Ooceraea biroi, which is evolutionarily distinct from those ants. The researchers sequenced the genomes of diploid males and females to look for regions of chromosomes where males had two identical alleles, but females had two different ones. They found such a region, a nearly 50,000 DNA base pair long stretch on chromosome 4 that was evolutionarily related to a non-coding RNA region found in the other two ant species. In this region, they also found patterns of genetic diversity consistent with a complementary sex determination locus. These patterns were not found near genes related to the gene transformer, which are complementary sex determination loci in honeybees and possibly one of the ant species. This suggests that the long non-coding RNA–based locus may have been conserved for over 100 million years of ant evolution, while the transformer-derived system may have evolved later in some species, possibly independently adopting a similar function to that in honeybees. Understanding complementary sex determination is crucial for the conservation of species, especially for pollinators. When populations shrink and inbreeding occurs, sterile diploid males can be produced, threatening population stability. Knowing which species use complementary sex determination can help track inbreeding and guide breeding programs. The discovery that a single complementary sex determination locus appears to be conserved across ants suggests that similar conservation strategies could apply to many species.",
  "Haldane's rule occupies a special place in biology as one of the few 'rules' of speciation, with empirical support from hundreds of species. And yet, its classic purview is restricted taxonomically to the subset of organisms with heteromorphic sex chromosomes. I propose explicit acknowledgement of generalized hypotheses about Haldane's rule that frame sex bias in hybrid dysfunction broadly and irrespective of the sexual system. The consensus view of classic Haldane's rule holds that sex-biased hybrid dysfunction across taxa is a composite phenomenon that requires explanations from multiple causes. Testing of the multiple alternative hypotheses for Haldane's rule is, in many cases, applicable to taxa with homomorphic sex chromosomes, environmental sex determination, haplodiploidy, and hermaphroditism. Integration of a variety of biological phenomena about hybrids across diverse sexual systems, beyond classic Haldane's rule, will help to derive a more general understanding of the contributing forces and mechanisms that lead to predictable sex biases in evolutionary divergence and speciation.",
  "Hymenoptera are haplodiploid: females arise from fertilized, diploid eggs, while males arise from unfertilized, haploid eggs. The cytogenetic mechanisms underlying haplodiploidy enable remarkable phenomena including female cloning, male cloning and gynandromorphy (sex mosaics). We collected 11 newly emerged putative gynandromorph honeybees from a single colony, assessed the sex of various tissues morphologically and determined the genetic origin (maternal or paternal) of each tissue by genotyping. Ten bees were gynandromorphs with one to three distinct paternal origins. Remarkably, one bee carried no maternal alleles. This bee had female organs throughout, and arose from the fusion of two sperm nuclei. This is the first reported case in the Hymenoptera of sperm fusion resulting in a female, emphasizing the flexibility for social insect reproduction and potentially novel colony-level social structures.",
  "The haplodiploid system of sex determination of Hymenoptera acts as an exaptation for species to evolve novel forms of asexual reproduction including thelytoky (clonal offspring of the mother). During normal reproduction in Hymenoptera, three of the four products of meiosis that are present in newly-laid eggs are lost as polar bodies, while the remaining pronucleus either develops as a haploid male or fuses with a sperm nucleus to produce a diploid zygote. In contrast, in thelytokous reproduction, which is uncommon but taxonomically widespread, two of the four products of meiosis fuse, as if one acted as a sperm. Queenless workers of Apis mellifera capensis, a subspecies of honey bee from South Africa, routinely reproduce thelytokously. Unmated A. m. capensis queens can also be induced to lay thelytokously by narcosis with carbon dioxide, but mated queens are never thelytokous. We artificially inseminated A. m. capensis queens using CO2 narcosis. Up to 1/3 of offspring workers carried two maternal alleles and an allele of one father whereas no three-allele progeny were seen in control queens of the arrhenotokous (unfertilized eggs result in males) subspecies A. m. scutellata Flow cytometry of three-allele individuals revealed that they were triploid and arose from the fertilization of a thelytokous fusion nucleus. We then reared six queens from a narcotized A. m. capensis queen and determined the ploidy of the offspring queens based on microsatellites. One of the five daughters was triploid. Following artificial insemination, this queen produced unfertilized thelytokous diploid eggs at high frequency, and unfertilized triploid eggs at much lower frequency. If fertilized, thelytokous diploid eggs were non-viable, even though triploidy in itself does not impede normal development. In contrast, when the rarer triploid eggs were fertilized, a proportion developed into viable tetraploids. Our study highlights the extraordinary developmental flexibility of haplo-diploid systems.",
  "In eusocial species, the sex ratio of helpers varies from female only, in taxa such as the social Hymenoptera (ants, bees, and wasps) [1], to an unbiased mixture of males and females, as in most termites [2]. Hamilton suggested that this difference owes to the haplodiploid genetics of the Hymenoptera leading to females being relatively more related to their siblings [3]. However, it has been argued that Hamilton's hypothesis does not work [4-9] and that the sex of helpers could instead be explained by variation in the ecological factors that favor eusociality [10]. Here we test these two competing hypotheses, which focus on the possible importance of different terms in Hamilton's rule [2, 11], with a comparative study across all sexual eusocial taxa. We find that the sex ratio of helpers (1) shows no significant correlation with whether species are haplodiploid or diploid and (2) shows a strong correlation with the ecological factor that had favored eusociality. Specifically, when the role of helpers is to defend the nest, both males and females help, whereas when the role of helpers is to provide brood care, then helpers are the sex or sexes that provided parental care ancestrally. More generally, our results confirm the ability of kin selection theory to explain the biology of eusocial species, independently of ploidy, and add support to the idea that haplodiploidy has been more important for shaping conflicts within eusocial societies than for explaining its origins [6, 12-19].",
  "Colonies of eusocial Hymenoptera, such as ants, bees and wasps, have long been recognized as candidates for the study of genomic imprinting on the grounds of evolutionary conflicts that arise from close interactions among colony members and relatedness asymmetry owing to haplodiploidy. Although a general kinship theory of genomic imprinting predicts its occurrence under various circumstances of the colony life cycle, new theoretical approaches are required to account for the specifics of real colonies based on recent advances in molecular-level understanding of ants and honeybees. Using a multivariate quantitative genetic model, we examined the potential impact of genomic imprinting on genes that determine the carrier female's propensity to develop into the queen caste. When queen overproduction owing to the increased propensity comes at a colony-level cost, the conflict between maternally and paternally inherited genes in polyandrous (queen multiple mating) colonies favours genomic imprinting. Moreover, we show that the genomic imprinting can occur even under monandry (queen single mating), once incorporating the costs differentially experienced by new males and new queens. Our model predicts the existence of imprinted 'genetic royal cheats' with patriline-specific expression in polyandrous colonies, and seems consistent with the paternal effect on queen determination in monandrous Argentine ants.",
  "In his famous haplodiploidy hypothesis, W. D. Hamilton proposed that high sister-sister relatedness facilitates the evolution of kin-selected reproductive altruism among Hymenopteran females. Subsequent analyses, however, suggested that haplodiploidy cannot promote altruism unless altruists capitalize on relatedness asymmetries by helping to raise offspring whose sex ratio is more female-biased than the population at large. Here, we show that haplodiploidy is in fact more favourable than is diploidy to the evolution of reproductive altruism on the part of females, provided only that dispersal is male-biased (no sex-ratio bias or active kin discrimination is required). The effect is strong, and applies to the evolution both of sterile female helpers and of helping among breeding females. Moreover, a review of existing data suggests that female philopatry and non-local mating are widespread among nest-building Hymenoptera. We thus conclude that Hamilton was correct in his claim that 'family relationships in the Hymenoptera are potentially very favourable to the evolution of reproductive altruism'.",
  "Haplodiploidy is one of the most widespread mechanisms of sex determination in animals. In many Hymenoptera, including all hitherto investigated social species, diploid individuals, which are heterozygous at the sex locus, develop as females, whereas haploid, hemizygous individuals develop as males (single-locus complementary sex determination, sl-CSD). Inbreeding leads to homozygosity at the sex locus, resulting in the production of diploid males, which are usually sterile and constitute a considerable fitness cost. Nevertheless, regular inbreeding without diploid male production is known from several solitary wasps, suggesting that in these species sex is not determined by sl-CSD but alternative mechanisms. Here, we examine sex determination in an ant with regular inbreeding, Cardiocondyla obscurior. The almost complete absence of diploid males after 10 generations of brother-sister mating in the laboratory documents for the first time the absence of sl-CSD and CSD with two or a few unlinked sex loci in a species of social Hymenoptera. Queens, which mated with a brother, appeared to decrease the number of males in their brood, as expected from the relatedness relationships under inbreeding. In contrast, some colonies began to show signs of an inbreeding depression after several generations of sib-mating, such as shortened queen life span, higher brood mortality, and a shift to more male-biased sex ratios in some colonies, presumably due to lower insemination capability of sperm.",
  "Characterizing how behaviour must be tuned to produce useful coordination is key to understanding the evolution and regulation of collective behaviour. While computational models can answer this for specific cases, recurring patterns in model dynamics suggest a more general means of classifying collective dynamics. Using ant foraging models as an example, we investigate mechanisms that produce symmetry-breaking transitions to bistability as a first basic classification. Collective transitions are functionally important: they lead to sudden changes in collective states, enhanced sensitivity to environmental inputs and hysteresis. We use bifurcation theory to argue that the point where discontinuous transitions merge at a continuous transition forms a codimension-2 bifurcation with universal properties, functionally equivalent to the critical point of a phase diagram. We show how analogous bistable transitions appear across ant foraging models with different mechanistic assumptions and explore biologically relevant effects near the transition. This framework clarifies the difficulty of tuning collective behaviour: locating a continuous transition typically requires tuning two parameters, while a discontinuous transition requires only one. Finally, we explore conditions that degrade or destroy bistability: heterogeneity blurs transitions, while recruitment without positive feedback produces no bistability.",
  "Magnetoreception is the ability of animals to detect and use the geomagnetic field (GMF) for spatial orientation. Cataglyphis ants are experimental models for insect navigation and magnetoreception. At the beginning of their foraging life, Cataglyphis ants perform learning walks (LWs), explorative excursions around the nest, with pirouettes (tight turns about the ants' body axes). During a pirouette, an ant gazes to the nest entrance, an invisible hole in the ground. Until now, Cataglyphis nodus has been the only desert ant species shown to use the GMF to align their gazes to the nest entrance during LW pirouettes. In the present study, we show that Cataglyphis hellenica, phylogenetically distant from C. nodus, but inhabiting the same environment, also possesses a magnetic sense. When C. hellenica ants are exposed to an experimental alteration of the GMF (alteration of the horizontal component about 180° or + 120°), they gaze to the fictive position of the nest entrance. This study demonstrates that C. hellenica ants use the GMF to gaze back to the nest entrance, confirming the presence of magnetoreception in a second Cataglyphis species, in addition to C. nodus. This suggests that the use of the GMF for path integration is rather common than unique in Cataglyphis species.",
  "Arboreal ants occupy a thermally dynamic environment, yet the mechanisms integrating nest architecture and worker behavior to maintain colony homeostasis remain understudied. We investigated the interplay among circadian rhythm, nest homeostasis, and worker morphology in Azteca chartifex spiriti, a Neotropical arboreal species that builds large polydomous nests suspended in trees. In ten colonies, we measured internal moisture and temperature gradients in the main nest, which houses most individuals, including the reproductive female, immatures, and numerous workers. In six colonies, we assessed the polymorphism of foraging workers over a 24 h cycle in relation to external temperature variation. The results show integrated thermoregulatory mechanisms that combine passive strategies, derived from nest architecture and moisture gradients from the suspension base to the lower extremity, with active strategies linked to foraging patterns and worker polymorphism. Internal temperature (27.8 ± 2.41 °C) remained buffered relative to external fluctuations, and moisture was significantly higher at the nest's lower extremity (p < 0.001). Worker size displayed a bimodal distribution during the day that shifted to a unimodal pattern at night, indicating behavioral adjustments to thermal and operational demands. These findings demonstrate that the interaction between physical structure and worker behavior maintains colony homeostasis, providing essential insights into how dominant canopy ants may cope with future climate change scenarios.",
  "In social insects, variations in worker behavior at both individual and group levels allow for rapid responses to environmental changes. The individual and group exploration behaviors of the tropical fire ant Solenopsis geminata were investigated in this study. Here we examined the time individual workers spent exploring four different food items, the types of food they discovered, and the dwell time (the duration spent on each food item). We also examined whether individual variations in exploratory behavior influence group-level exploratory behavior. In the individual exploration assay, there were significant effects of nest and food on the dwell time. The average exploratory time taken by workers in the group exploration assay showed no significant difference between experienced and inexperienced workers in Nest 1. However, a significant difference was found between the groups in Nest 2. Here, observations showed that S. geminata workers in the group could find the food more quickly than individual workers. Our work suggested that varying degrees of exploratory behavior exist among individual workers and groups, which may potentially impact foraging efficiency and resource utilization. The tropical fire ant, S. geminata, is a globally invasive species that has been introduced to Taiwan for over 40 years. Incorporating an analysis of exploratory behavior into the study of invasive species allows us to better understand the mechanisms driving their progression.",
  "Traditional methods of forage identification are impractical with non-leafcutting fungus gardening ants, making diet-related ecological and life history questions difficult to study. To address this limitation, we utilized dietary DNA metabarcoding on excavated ant fungus gardens to generate forage diversity metrics for the two co-occurring species Trachymyrmex septentrionalis and Mycetomoellerius turrifex. Ten fungus garden samples from each species were collected from a 60x70 m plot in East Texas. Each of the colonies we sampled was paired with a colony from the other species within 3 m of it. Plant forage diversity was assessed with chloroplast trnL primers, and insect frass forage diversity was assessed with mitochondria COI primers. DNA metabarcoding identified a total of 44 plant taxa across all samples, but performed poorly when characterizing foraged insect frass. Plant beta diversity was significantly different between the gardens of T. septentrionalis and M. turrifex colonies, as well as paired colonies. Colony pairs also had significantly different plant alpha diversity. This indicates that diet preference is likely driven both by ant species-specific plant preference, and colony location-specific plant resource availability. Overall, our results show that dietary DNA techniques are a promising tool for the identification of plant forage in ant fungus gardens, enabling the study of future diet-based ecological and natural history questions.",
  "Regurgitation in insects is generally regarded as having digestive and defensive functions. Despite a significant aversion of locust regurgitation to some predators, the defensive mechanisms against predators remain unclear. Herein, we employ the locust-ant as a prey-predator system to investigate the defensive mechanism of locust regurgitation by behavioral bioassays, chemical analyses, and electrophysiological experiments. We found that locusts can use their regurgitation in response to a wide range of predators, including fire ants, mantises, and sparrows. Locust regurgitation is mainly secreted from the crop and salivary glands (SG). The colony and individual foraging behavior of ants demonstrated that locust regurgitation and mealworms smeared with the regurgitation significantly repelled the ants' attack. A combination of chemical analysis and behavior assays confirmed that small-molecule compounds, rather than proteins in locust regurgitation, exerted the defensive effect. Among the 907 compounds in the regurgitation, only the mixture of diethyl glutarate (DG) from the SG and 3-methylindole (3MI) and 2-(formylamino)benzoic acid (FBA) from the crop can deter predation of the ants. Furthermore, the mixture of three compounds mediates defense and aversion by stimulating ant gustation based on electrophysiological trials. Our findings reveal molecular evidence of locust regurgitation for chemical defense, offering a pivotal compound combination mediating the interactions in prey-predator systems.",
  "Navigation is crucial for animal survival, and despite their small brains, insects are impressive at it. For example, desert ants acquire environmental information by learning to walk before foraging, enabling them to return home accurately over long distances. These learning walks involve multimodal sensory experiences and induce neuroplastic changes in the Central Complex (CX) and the Mushroom Body (MB) of ants' brains, making them a key topic in behavioural science, neuroscience, and computational modelling. To address unresolved questions in how ants integrate sensory cues and adapt navigation strategies, we propose a computational model that achieves multisensory integration during learning walks. Central to this model is a novel Learning Vector mechanism that dynamically combines visual, olfactory, and path integration inputs to guide movement decisions. Specifically, the agent in our model determines the degree to which it deviates from the homing direction by evaluating the familiarity of the environment. In this way, agents could strike a balance between their tendency to explore and the need to return safely to the nest. Our model replicates key features reported in biological studies and accounts for individual and inter-species variability by tuning parameters such as cue preferences and environmental parameters. This flexibility enables the simulation of species-specific learning walks and supports a unified view of sensory integration and behavioural adaptation. Moreover, it yields testable predictions that may inform future investigations into the neural and behavioural mechanisms underlying insects' learning walks. How the proposed model could be adapted for robotics navigation has also been discussed.",
  "Ants and termites play important roles in tropical ecosystems, leading to an evolutionary arms race in which diverse foraging, predation, and counterpredation strategies developed. These strategies resulted in the emergence of specialized predators of termites, such as the African termite-raiding ant, Megaponera analis, which organizes coordinated raids on termites of agricultural importance belonging to the subfamily Macrotermitinae. Decades of field and laboratory studies have examined the natural history of M. analis, describing its distribution, raiding behavior, chemical ecology, task allocation, rescue and other helping behaviors, and nursing of wounds. However, the potential of M. analis for the management of termites is yet to be explored. This review synthesizes the literature on M. analis, outlines recent progress in understanding its ecology, identifies knowledge gaps, and proposes directions for future research and possible applications of the knowledge to different fields.",
  "We present evidence that the faint polarized moonlight pattern of the sky can be used for navigation in a diurnal animal, the bull ant Myrmecia tarsata. This comes despite this species lacking the highly refined low-light visual specializations of nocturnal bull ants. Celestial bodies can provide animals with directional information, yet direct observation can often be occluded. Positional information of solar and lunar cues can be estimated via their polarized light pattern, present across the sky. The sun's polarization pattern is widely used in animals, and a similar, yet much fainter, pattern is produced by the moon. However, given the inherent variability of the moon, it is unknown how widespread moonlight use is in navigating animals. Here, M. tarsata, which forages throughout the day, returning home at sunset, uses both solar and lunar polarized light to navigate. We compare this to the closely related nocturnal sympatric Myrmecia midas navigating under identical conditions. Both species clearly use solar and lunar polarized light patterns to navigate, but M. tarsata showed degraded performance under polarized moonlight as a function of lunar phase, decreasing performance as illumination decreased. Myrmecia midas, in contrast, exhibited impressive attendance to lunar polarization patterns throughout the lunar month.",
  "Nectar thieves may seriously impact pollinator foraging behavior and, ultimately, pollination services in natural and agricultural contexts. Despite strong interest in pollinators and their services, there remain gaps in our knowledge as to how ants influence bee foraging decisions. Here, we characterized ant-bee interactions at shared resources and the subsequent behavioral sequences exhibited by bees. We found that two-thirds of bumble bee (Bombus impatiens Cresson) behaviors at nectar resources involved direct interactions with Argentine ants (Linepithema humile Mayr). Consistent with predictions of interference competition, the number of ants at a shared resource decreased the probability of a bee feeding and increased the likelihood of a bee being bitten. Similarly, getting bitten by an ant decreased the probability that a bee would subsequently feed and increased the likelihood that a bee engaged in aggressive responses, such as gaping mandibles and attacking the ant. Behavioral sequences fell into two clusters: Cluster 1 was characterized by feeding and nonaggressive behaviors, and Cluster 2 was exemplified by strings of aggressive behaviors. Behavioral sequences that included aggression were longer and more diverse than those involving predominately nonaggressive behaviors, demonstrating that aggression (either on the part of the bee or the ant) extended behavioral exchanges and disrupted bumblebee foraging and resource collection. Our study identified that ant abundance and aggressive biting behaviors were strong predictors of subsequent bee actions. Such experiences may contribute to learned avoidance of ants in future encounters, consistent with interference competition theory, and have broader implications for disrupted foraging in social animals.",
  "To elucidate the distribution patterns of ant species in the Huanglianshan National Nature Reserve, a plot-based survey method was employed to investigate ant diversity within the reserve. A total of 209 ant species, representing 9 subfamilies and 66 genera, were collected from 38 plots spanning eight vertical gradient transects. Elevation significantly influenced ant communities within the reserve. Both ant species richness and genus richness exhibited a unimodal pattern (peaking at mid-elevations) rather than a simple linear relationship with increasing elevation. Ordination analysis revealed significant dissimilarity between communities at low- and high-elevation sites. Furthermore, the distance-decay model confirmed that community similarity significantly decreased with increasing elevational distance. Regression analysis demonstrated a significant positive correlation between the upper elevational distribution limit of ant species and their elevational distribution breadth, indicating that species occurring at higher elevations possess wider vertical adaptation ranges. Subsequent statistical analysis of foraging and nesting habits showed that the majority of ants foraged on the ground surface and nested within the soil. Among the habitats sampled, low-altitude tropical seasonal rainforest and coniferous-broadleaved mixed forest harbored the highest ant species richness. In contrast, eucalyptus plantations and rubber plantations, which exhibit a higher degree of landscape homogeneity, supported significantly fewer ant species. Our data establish a foundation for further research on elevational variation and provide context for discussing key aspects of ant management and conservation in Huanglianshan National Nature Reserve.",
  "Morphological evolution reflects a balance between the emergence of novel traits and the reduction or loss of existing traits, and both of these processes shape the diversity of life. Trait simplification, which involves the reduction or loss of structures, is a common phenomenon that provides adaptive advantages in novel ecological contexts. In this study, we examined the evolutionary dynamics and morphological outcomes of the reduction and simplification of the stinging apparatus in ants to elucidate the effect of these changes on broader evolutionary trajectories. Using a phylogenetically informed sampling of 98 ant genera, we explored how stinger morphology evolved in conjunction with behavioural and ecological changes, employing linear morphometrics and phylogenetic comparative methods. Our results revealed that transitions from piercing to nonpiercing stingers were substantially associated with dietary diversification and shifts in foraging strategies, thus reflecting the evolutionary compromises between defense, predation, and ecological specialization. Piercing stingers promoted predatory efficiency and ecological specialization, while nonpiercing stingers imparted behavioural and dietary versatility, such as herbivory and cooperative foraging. These findings highlight that morphological simplification is a key adaptive mechanism in driving ecological transitions and diversification and promoting evolutionary innovation.",
  "Ecological specialization is a result of the interplay between ecological and evolutionary processes. One iconic ecological specialization of the Neotropics involves birds that follow army ant swarms in feeding groups. Prior work has focused on a single avian family, the Neotropical antbirds (Thamnophilidae), but over a century of fieldwork has now revealed that ant-following occurs in hundreds of distantly related birds. To understand the relative contributions of shared ancestry and ecological specialization in the evolution of ant-following, we compiled a database of all Neotropical ant-following birds (n = 472 species) and their degree of specialization on army ants, and tested if (1) ant-following becomes increasingly specialized through evolutionary time and (2) ecomorphological functional traits predict ant-following behavior. Ancestral state reconstruction revealed that specialized ant-following evolved independently in 8 clades and 4 families of Neotropical birds (Antbirds: Thamnophilidae, Ovenbirds: Furnariidae, Tanagers: Thraupidae, and Cuckoos: Cuculidae). Ant-following behavior was highly conserved phylogenetically (Pagel's λ = 0.97), and specialized clades evolved from less specialized ancestors, with few evolutionary reversals. In contrast, ecomorphological traits poorly predicted the level of ant-following specialization across species. Our results suggest increasing specialization on army ants is governed by niche conservatism, not ecological specialization.",
  "Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Liviidae), the Asian citrus psyllid, threatens global citrus production by transmitting Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus, the causal agent of Huanglongbing (HLB), a destructive disease causing severe yield losses. This study evaluated the ant species Pheidole parva Mayr (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) as a biological control agent against D. citri. Using morphological identification and mitochondrial COI gene sequencing, P. parva was confirmed as a dominant psyllid predator. Behavioral observations revealed a preference for preying on early nymphal instars (first to third) over late nymphs and adults. Functional response modeling showed a Holling Type II pattern, where predation rate increased with prey density but plateaued due to handling time constraints. Additionally, search efficiency decreased with rising ant density, aligning with the Hassell-Varley model and indicating intraspecific foraging interference. These findings highlight P. parva's efficacy in suppressing D. citri populations, particularly HLB-transmission-critical nymphs. By elucidating ant-psyllid interaction dynamics via ecological models, this research supported integrating P. parva into sustainable pest management. Further studies on field deployment and ecological compatibility are recommended to maximize its predatory potential, mitigate HLB impacts, and enhance citrus production resilience. The findings provided empirical support for using P. parva in integrated pest management programs against D. citri.",
  "Solitary foraging ants excel at route following using minimal neural resources, Robots don't. Recent biological studies proposed lateralized, nest-centric memories to explain ants' direct visual homing but did not address how ants follow curved visual routes away from their nest. We present a biologically inspired neuromorphic model for one-shot panoramic route learning and continuous route following, implemented on a compact car-like robot, Antcar. We demonstrate that route-centric lateralized memories, inspired by the insect mushroom body, enable Antcar to achieve bi-directional route-following, with motivation-driven recognition of route extremities and familiarity-based velocity control. With rigorous Lyapunov-based stability analysis and an empirical memory scalability evaluation, the model was tested over 1.6 km across 113 challenging real-world trials. The system achieves less than 25 cm median lateral error using minimal resources (800-pixel input, 300 MB RAM, 500 mW power, and 18.75 kB memory per 50 m route), offering insights into insect cognition and advancing autonomous robotics under strict resource constraints.",
  "Nests of species of the genus Atta are, structurally, the most complex among those of the Attini tribe. The objective of this research was to describe external and internal characteristics of nests of the leaf-cutting ant Atta sexdens (L. 1758) (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) in Vitória da Conquista, Bahia state, Brazil. Ten nests (N1 to N10) of this ant were selected and their external architecture described according to the loose soil removed from excavations by ant forage workers. The length and width of foraging trails and the distance of their entrance holes to the mound of loose soil in nests of this ant were measured. The internal architecture and the number, shape, dimensions and depth of the internal chambers and tunnels of the N1, N2 and N3 nests, with loose soil areas of 78.02, 8.06 and 4.78 m2, respectively, were described and measured. The nest N1 was excavated without moulding and the N2 and N3 moulded with 5 kg of cement in 10 L of water and subsequently excavated. Trenches, one meter deep, were made before excavation began and widened and deepened until exposing the chambers and tunnels of these nests. The ants deposited loose soil irregularly, forming small mounds around the entrance holes of their nests. Fungus and empty chambers are spherical with twig-like branches. The inner sections of the tunnels are elliptical or circular with different dimensions.",
  "Individually foraging ants use egocentric views as a dominant navigation strategy for learning and retracing routes. Evidence suggests that route retracing can be achieved by algorithms which use views as 'visual compasses', where individuals choose the heading that leads to the most familiar visual scene when compared to route memories. However, such a mechanism does not naturally lead to route approach, and alternative strategies are required to enable convergence when off-route and for correcting on-route divergence. In this work we investigate how behaviour incorporated into visual compass like route learning and recapitulation strategies might enable convergence to a learned route and its destination. Without alterations to the basic form of the initial learning route, the most successful recapitulation method comes from a 'cast and surge' approach, a mechanism seen across arthropods for olfactory navigation. In this strategy casts form a 'zig-zagged' or oscillatory search in space for familiar views, and surges exploit visual familiarity gradients. We also find that performance improves if the learned route consists of an oscillatory motor mechanism with learning gated to occur when the agent approaches the central axis of the oscillation. Furthermore, such oscillations combined with the cast and surge method additively enhance performance, showing that it benefits to incorporate oscillatory behaviour in both learning and recapitulation. As destination reaching is the primary goal of navigation, we show that a suitably sized goal-orientated learning walk might suffice, but that the scale of this is dependent on the degree of divergence, and thus depends on route length and the route learning and recapitulation strategies used. Finally we show that view familiarity can modulate on-the-spot scans performed by an agent, providing a better reflection of ant behaviour. Overall, our results show that the visual compass can provide a basis for robust visual navigation, so long as it is considered holistically with the details of basic motor and sensory-motor patterns of ants undertaking route learning and recapitulation.",
  "As human society continues to grow and evolve, so does the need for effective pest management strategies. Olfactory-mediated control methods, such as attractant and repellent compounds, are a proposed strategy for mitigating the damaging effects of some insect pests, most notably ants, that rely on olfaction for communication. To develop such compounds, it is first important to comprehensively understand the target species' olfactory transcriptome in order to guide future targeted functional characterization of relevant olfactory proteins. Here, we perform bulk RNA-seq analysis of antennae from three notable pest ant species, Camponotus floridanus, Atta sexdens, and Atta cephalotes. Specifically, we highlight the expression profiles of olfactory receptor genes, as they may serve as potential targets of future industry research and application. We find that the ant antennal transcriptome differs between each species' castes, potentially reflecting varying behaviors and tasks, and also appears to be influenced by the surrounding environment. Our findings suggest a general up-regulation of olfactory receptor genes amongst foraging castes, also demonstrating that, when comparing foraging ants from differing environments, olfactory-related genes exhibit considerable patterns of differential expression. These findings suggest variable olfactory sensitivity depending on the aforementioned factors, warranting further investigation into whether differing caste and environmental conditions may negatively influence the effectiveness of broad-range olfactory-mediated pest management strategies. Development of pest management tools that target specific groups of insects by environment or caste may lead to more effective control.",
  "Liquid brains conceptualize living systems that operate without central control, where collective outcomes emerge from local and dynamic interactions. This concept extends beyond ants and other social insects to include immune systems, slime molds, and microbiomes. In such systems, connectivity scales with population density, facilitating more efficient information transfer as group size increases. However, in sparse conditions, where fewer individuals interact, movement likely plays a crucial role in shaping connectivity, ensuring optimal collective efficiency. We tested this hypothesis during the foraging process of Aphaenogaster senilis, an ant species that does not primarily rely on chemical communication. We empirically measured ant movement behavior and characterized their foraging dynamics across large spatiotemporal scales, closely reflecting the species' natural ecology. Integrating observed movement heterogeneity into a neuronal-like model, we quantitatively replicated ants foraging efficiency and spatiotemporal dynamics. Our results reveal that a simple feedback mechanism, mediated by local interactions, governs the foraging patterns of A. senilis. Such feedback is modulated by adjusting the proportion of two coexisting movement behaviors: recruits, which facilitated information transfer and food exploitation by aggregating closely to the nest and the food patches, and scouts, which could bypass this feedback and discover alternative food sources. Therefore, distinct movement patterns contributed differently to optimizing each phase of the foraging process, proving an adaptive mechanism to balance exploration and exploitation. Our findings underscore how incorporating specific biologically grounded insights into complex systems frameworks, enhances our understanding of the mechanisms underlying collective intelligence in biological systems.",
  "Goal-oriented learning and navigation is well known in eusocial insects. The solitary foraging of nocturnal bull ants Myrmecia midas in their visually complex environment relies on path integration and landmark learning. While this species seems to be 'sensitive' to handling and reacts to visual changes in their surroundings, not much is known about how added olfactory stimuli impact their route navigation on a vertical surface. In the current study, we added one of five different invisible odours on the trees on which foragers normally forage. We found that the bull ants showed phobic responses to all the odours. The Tea-tree and Lavender odours showed the strongest impact on the bull ants' navigation by causing detours, U-turns, and avoidance of the sensory stimuli, with the ants meandering more and scanning more frequently. The odours of Olive oil, Flax-seed oil, and Eucalyptus oil had a moderate impact on the ants' navigation. These findings showed the widespread influence of non-visual chemical cues in shaping bull ant navigation, reactions that we interpret as neophobic responses stemming from chemical alterations on learned routes. A second experiment supported the interpretation of neophobia as opposed to an inherent aversion to the odours. Repeated exposure to Lavender led to reduced aversive responding. Overall, this study contributes to the understanding of the effects of foreign odours, adding to our understanding of the complex learning processes of bull ants in their vertical navigation.",
  "BACKGROUND: Aging theory suggests that animals should reproduce early at a cost to longevity, leading to a fecundity-longevity trade-off. Social insects with long-lived reproductive queens and short-lived helper workers are notable exceptions, primarily attributed to selection on queen lifespan in the protected nest and increased extrinsic mortality of workers performing risky outside tasks. By creating different age groups of non-reproductive workers in an ant where workers can replace reproductive queens and by isolating single workers with and without helpers, we investigated the effect of age on reproductive and parenting abilities and the impact of help on reproductive worker lifespan. RESULTS: Isolated workers could become reproductive and raise offspring to adulthood despite commencing reproduction at ages twice the median lifespan of non-reproductive worker ants. Experimentally selected old workers converged with workers half the median age to a common lifespan maximum of about 600 days in the absence of worker help. However, most reproductive workers surviving beyond this point were associated with at least one helper worker and showed a marked lifespan increase. In a separate test, helper presence increased the median life-span at least 2.6-fold in single, isolated workers compared to helperless workers. CONCLUSIONS: Helper presence may be a primary reason for the longevity differences between reproductive and non-reproductive individuals in social insects similar to cooperatively breeding birds and mammals while mechanisms associated with selection on queen lifespan have evolved secondarily. Contrary to many ant species with high extrinsic mortality, some with sexual reproduction invest in reproductive capacities until advanced age.",
  "Symbiotic relationships across trophic levels influence invasions. Although Epichloë endophytes are often linked to forage grasses spread through alkaloid-mediated herbivore resistance, this link oversimplifies a complex, multifactorial process. We investigate whether this fungal endophyte interacts with the fungus garden of the native leaf-cutting ant Acromyrmex ambiguus by inducing the release of a widespread green leaf volatile, thereby altering its foraging behavior. We conducted 5-d choice experiments to assess ant preferences for leaves and seeds of Lolium multiflorum plants, either infected (E+) or uninfected (E-) with Epichloë occultans, along with a Petri dish assay to evaluate the effects of (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate (Z3-HAC) on the growth of Leucoagaricus gongylophorus, ants' mutualistic fungi. Ants exhibited delayed rejection for E+ plants while showing no preference for seeds. In vitro, Z3-HAC promoted fungal growth away from volatile sources. These findings suggest that mutualistic fungi of a grass (alien) and its herbivore (native) shape their defense strategies in Pampean grasslands. Z3-HAC's effects extend beyond direct plant-herbivore interactions, signaling antagonistic fungi within the fungal garden without acting as a novel weapon. This study highlights the importance of integrating microbial networks into invasion ecology frameworks to understand the consequences of co-introduced plants and symbionts.",
  "Pheromone guidance of ant foraging activity is well described, but less is known about how the presence of inward ant traffic on the trail affects the behavior of naive nestmates and if these influences are dependent or independent of pheromone signaling. Here, we examined whether the flow of foraging Lasius niger ants coming from a feeder influences the movements of naive nestmates traversing a pheromone trail. We used a device that permitted individual ants to travel from the nest to a feeder via a single bridge under four conditions; unidirectional inward ant traffic, where naive foraging ants contacted only colony members returning from the feeder along a pheromone trail; foraging following a pheromone trail without ant traffic; foraging with neither a pheromone trail nor ant traffic; foraging with bidirectional ant traffic, where naive ants encountered other ants moving both toward the feeder and returning on the pheromone trail. The time required by inexperienced ants to reach the feeder was shorter in the unidirectional condition (returning from the feeder) than the other three conditions. These findings suggest that specific cues can regulate the movement of pheromone-guide foraging by ants.",
  "Animals often need to make decisions about whether to confront risks, and climate change is making these decisions even more critical by increasing environmental stress. Biogenic amines are crucial for modulating behavior in all animals and may contribute to behavioral adaptations to changing environments through supporting decision-making involving risk. Our review focuses on the neuromodulator dopamine in insects because of its role in risk-related behavioral choices, particularly in the context of ant foraging activity. In ants, individual decisions contribute to the collective regulation of foraging activity. We consider the role of dopamine in the regulation of collective foraging activity to manage water loss in the desert red harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex barbatus, in the southwest US that is undergoing severe drought. We discuss dopaminergic circuitry and its involvement in decisions about foraging risk, drawing from both the vertebrate and invertebrate literature, to outline areas of future research in the role of dopamine in collective decision-making in response to changing environmental conditions.",
  "Foraging ant colonies often face the challenge that food items can appear unpredictably across their territory. This is analogous to traveling salesman/salesperson problems (TSP), wherein solutions to visiting multiple possibly-rewarding sites can vary in cost, travel distance, or site revisits. However, TSP solutions for ants are likely also constrained by cognitive limitations. Rather than envisioning entire routes, ants probably determine their paths by individual-level responses to immediate stimuli, such as nestmate presence or avoiding revisiting an already explored site. Thus, complex group-level search and food retrieval patterns may self-organize from simple individual-level movement rules. Here we derive solutions through simulations that optimize net foraging gains across groups of ant-like agents. Agent search strategies evolve in three spatial networks that differ in travel distances to nests, connectivity, and modularity. We compare patterns from simulations to observed foraging of Argentine ants (Linepithema humile) in identical spatial networks. The simulations and ant experiments find foraging patterns are sensitive to both network characteristics and predictability of food appearance. Simulations are consistent in multiple ways with observed ant behavior, particularly in how network arrangements affect search effort, food encounters, and forager distributions (e.g., clustering in the more connected cells). In some distributions, however, ants find food more successfully than simulations predict. This may reflect a greater premium on encountering food in ants versus increasing find exploitation rates for agents. Overall, the results are encouraging that evolutionary optimization models incorporating relevant ant biology can successfully predict expression of complex group-level behavior.",
  "Insects, being among the most diverse and abundant organisms in terrestrial ecosystems, are inevitably exposed to ubiquitous micro- and nanoplastic contaminants. Although studies on the impact of these contaminants on terrestrial insects are gradually emerging, they remain limited in scope. In this study, we investigated the biological traits (including foraging behavior, food assumption, digging ability, body weight and survival) of the Japanese carpenter ant, Camponotus japonicus, in response to exposure to polystyrene micro- and nanoplastic (PS-M/NP) solutions containing three particle sizes (0.05, 1 and 50 μm) and four concentrations (0.1, 1, 10 and 50 mg/mL). The results showed that worker ants exhibited significant foraging preference and food consumption for non-contaminated solutions in multiple-choice experiments, indicating that worker ants C. japonicus can differentiate and avoid feeding on PS-M/NP-contaminated solutions. Meanwhile, PS-M/NPs significantly reduced the foraging ability of worker ants in multiple-choice and no-choice experiments, with the smallest particle size (0.05 μm) and highest concentration (50 mg/mL) of PS-M/NPs resulting in the longest pre-foraging period, the lowest percentage of licking and the amount of food consumption. In addition, the weight of sand removed by worker ants, the body weight and survival of worker ants showed a dramatic decline with a decrease in particle size, increase in concentration and prolonged in exposure time of PS-M/NP-contaminated solutions. The results of this study confirm that PS-M/NPs have an adverse effect on these worker ants in a particle size, concentration and exposure time-dependent manner, with small particle size, high concentration and longer exposure time being the key factors in decreasing the foraging behavior and biological traits of this insect.",
  "Herbivores can negatively impact plant reproduction by altering floral traits, pollination, and fruit production. To counteract this, plants developed defense mechanisms, such as the biotic defense resulting from associations with ants. The aim of this study was to investigate whether leaf herbivory at different intensities influences reproductive success and extrafloral nectar secretion patterns in a savanna plant, Banisteriopsis malifolia (Malpighiaceae). Plants were subjected to simulated leaf herbivory and divided into three groups: Control (damage < 5%), T15 (15% leaf area removed), and T50 (50% leaf area removed). Assessments continued until fruiting. The findings indicate an increase in extrafloral nectar sugar concentration after simulated herbivory. Increasing foliar damage significantly delayed the time to bloom, decreased the number of inflorescences per plant, and reduced the size of buds and flowers. Foliar damage significantly decreased fruit size. Furthermore, ant foraging was influenced by herbivory, with a predominance of aggressive ants on plants with high levels of damage. Our study shows that varying levels of leaf damage affect extrafloral nectar secretion, ant foraging behavior, and plant reproductive structures. These findings highlight how insect herbivores and the level of damage they cause influence plant fitness and consequently community structure.",
  "Leaf-cutter ants cut fresh leaves to grow a symbiotic fungus as crop. During cutting, one mandible is typically anchored onto the leaf lamina while the other slices through it like a knife. When initiating cuts into the leaf edge, however, foragers sometimes deviate from this behaviour and instead use their mandibles symmetrically, akin to scissors. In vivo behavioural assays revealed that the preference for either of the two cutting strategies depended on leaf edge geometry and differed between natural leaf margins that were straight or serrated with notch-like folds: leaf-cutter ants displayed a strong preference for scissor-cutting when leaf edges were straight or had wide notches. This preference, however, reversed in favour of knife-cutting when notches were narrow. To investigate whether this behavioural difference had a mechanical origin, we mimicked knife-cutting in ex vivo cutting experiments: for wide notches, all but the sharpest mandibles failed to initiate cuts, or only did so at large forces, caused by substantial leaf buckling and bending. This increased force demand would substantially limit the ability of foragers to cut leaves, and so reduce the colony's access to food sources. Scissor-cutting may thus be an adaptation to the mechanical difficulties associated with bending and buckling of thin leaves.",
  "Resource and nutrient availability varies spatially and influences animal foraging patterns. Under the compensation hypothesis, animals should preferentially forage for the most limiting nutrient in the environment. Animal nutrient preferences have been well studied in the tropics, where terrestrial and arboreal fauna are clearly differentiated and limited by different nutrients. In temperate forests, vertical stratification of the fauna may be less pronounced and its role in foraging ecology is poorly understood. Here, we examine nutrient preference patterns over a vertical gradient in temperate forests and nearby urban centers in North Carolina, USA. Using a bait-choice experiment and novel bait design, we measured ant community nutrient preferences in the canopy and on the ground of 83 trees across 14 sites and assessed ant diversity and community composition. Ant diversity did not differ across the vertical strata or habitat types, but species turnover altered community composition to create four distinct assemblages. In temperate forests, ants did not prefer a particular nutrient in either stratum, likely due to extensive foraging across strata. In urban habitats, however, ant nutrient preferences matched patterns well known from tropical systems: arboreal animals preferred protein, while terrestrial animals preferred carbohydrates. Rather than stratum-specific nutrient limitations, however, we attribute the differences in urban preference patterns to changes in native species' foraging intensity and the addition of uniquely urban species with specific nutrient preferences. These results underscore the necessity of testing ecological hypotheses across biomes and suggest that urbanization may produce established ecological patterns via novel mechanisms.",
  "Ants are known for their sophisticated navigational abilities and rely on various cues to locate food sources efficiently. Visual landmarks play a crucial role in guiding foraging behavior. However, the significance of walking ants perceiving the relative motion of a landmark to themselves during learning is still not fully understood. Here, Japanese carpenter ants were observed on a treadmill device where they could walk in place on the treadmill. Two types of conditions were set for the training process: the fixed condition involved a stationary landmark, and the moving condition featured a landmark oscillating at a constant speed from side to side after feeding, which was independent of the movements of the ants. In the Y-maze test, a significantly greater number of ants in the moving training condition associated the landmark with food (82% of the ants) than in the fixed training condition (56% of the ants). Our results thus suggest that perceiving the relative movement of landmarks during the learning process on a treadmill is important for ant foragers.",
  "Gene selection plays a crucial role in the pre-processing of microarray data, aiming to identify a small set of genes that enhances classification accuracy and reduces costs. Traditional methods, such as Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Maximum Relevance Minimum Redundancy (MRMR), have been widely used, but bio-inspired algorithms like Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and Ant Lion Optimizer (ALO) have shown promising results. These algorithms are based on natural processes: ACO mimics the foraging behavior of ants, while ALO models the hunting strategy of ant-lion larvae. However, both approaches face challenges like premature convergence and inefficient feature space mapping when used individually. To address these issues, this work introduces a hybrid ACO-ALO method, combining the strengths of both algorithms. The proposed hybrid approach enhances feature selection by improving accuracy, reducing computational complexity, and boosting classifier performance. The proposed model, which identifies the optimal feature set for classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM), has achieved an impressive prediction accuracy of 93.94 %. Results on microarray datasets for leukemia prediction show that the hybrid approach outperforms other methods in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. This work demonstrates the potential of hybrid optimization techniques in bioinformatics for better gene selection and cancer diagnosis.•Hybrid ACO-ALO approach combines strengths of both algorithms for better feature selection.•Enhances classifier performance while reducing computational complexity.•Outperforms traditional methods on leukemia prediction datasets.",
  "Ants are a diverse and ecologically important group of social insects, playing a key role in ecosystem functioning. However, significant gaps remain in our understanding of their distribution across the Brazilian biomes. In this study, we surveyed four sites within a poorly sampled region of the Cerrado, located between Mato Grosso (MT) and Goiás (GO) states in Brazil. Using attractive baits for ants foraging on the ground and in the vegetation, we conducted two rounds of sampling across 20 transects using 40 baits each, totaling 1,600 baits. We recorded 133 ant species from 34 genera and 8 subfamilies. Myrmicinae and Formicinae showed the highest species richness. The five most frequent species were from the genera Camponotus and Pheidole. Notably, 12 species are officially new records for MT and GO, including two rare species for Cerrado's myrmecofauna. Species richness per site ranged from 59 to 80 species, with the lowest richness occurring where all sampling comprised only savanna habitat, while sites harboring savanna and forest habitats yielded higher species counts, suggesting that vegetation heterogeneity promotes ant diversity. We also recorded more species on the ground (118) than in the vegetation (78). There were marked differences in richness and composition between strata, highlighting the vertical stratification of ant communities. These findings improve our understanding of ant diversity, but additional surveys are needed to better characterize the myrmecofauna across this region of the Cerrado. Furthermore, we encourage biologists to share their consultancy species lists, which could help to fill many knowledge gaps existing about Brazilian biodiversity.",
  "Solitarily foraging ants learn to navigate between important locations by comparing their current view with memorized scenes along a familiar route. As desert ants, in particular, travel between their nest and a food source, they establish stable and visually guided routes that guide them without relying on trail pheromones. We investigated how changes in familiar visual scenes affect the navigation of the red honey ant (Melophorus bagoti). In Experiment 1, ants were trained to follow a one-way diamond-shaped path to forage and return home. We manipulated scene familiarity by adding a board on their homebound route just before the nest. In Experiment 2, ants were trained to travel a straight path from their nest to a feeder, and we removed the prominent landmarks on the route after they had established a stable route. We predicted that these scene changes would cause the ants to deviate from their usual straight paths, slow down, scan more, and increase their lateral oscillations to gather additional information. Our findings showed that when the familiar scene was changed, ants oscillated more, slowed their speed, and increased scanning bouts, indicating a shift from exploiting known information to more actively exploring and learning new visual cues. These results suggest that scene familiarity plays a crucial role in ant navigation, and changes in their visual environment lead to distinct behavioral adaptations aimed at learning about the new cues.",
  "The desert ant Cataglyphis fortis inhabits the harsh and featureless North African saltpans. Individuals forage long distances and return to their inconspicuous nest entrance using path integration, but also rely on visual and olfactory landmarks. Here, we investigated the navigational decision making of these ants in differently structured environments. While individual ants show consistent route preferences, significant variability exists between individuals. Furthermore, the ants favor repetitive routes, suggesting that vision-based learning mechanisms and motor responses guide their navigation, with similar visual cues leading to similar egocentric decisions. This formation of idiosyncratic routes, seen in other ant species, appears to be conserved in C. fortis despite its usually flat habitat.",
  "Unlike any other group of animals, all ant species are social: individual ants share the food they gather with their nestmates and as a consequence they must repeatedly leave their nest to find food and then return home with it. These back-and-forth foraging trips have been studied for about a century and much of our growing understanding of the strategies underlying animal navigation has come from these studies. One important strategy that ants use to keep track of where they are on a foraging trip is 'path integration', in which they continuously update a 'home vector' that gives their estimated distance and direction from the nest. As path integration accumulates errors, it cannot be relied on to bring ants precisely home: such precision is accomplished by using views of the nest acquired before they start foraging. Further learning is scaffolded by home vectors or remembered food vectors, which guide a route and help in learning useful views experienced on the way. Many species rely on olfaction as well as vision for route guidance and the full details of their foraging paths have revealed how ants use a mix of innate and learnt multisensory cues. Wood ants, a species on which we focus in this review, take an oscillating path along a pheromone trail to sample odours, but acquire visual information only at the peaks and troughs of the oscillations. To provide a working model of the neural basis of the multimodal navigational strategies of ants, we outline the anatomy and functioning of major central brain areas and neural circuits - the central complex, mushroom bodies and lateral accessory lobes - that are involved in the coordination of navigational behaviour and the learning of visual and olfactory patterns. Because ant brains have not yet been well-studied, we rely on the work that has been done with other species - notably, Drosophila, silkworm moths and bees - to derive plausible neural circuitry that can deliver the ants' navigational strategies.",
  "Comparing the diversity of gut microbiota between and within social insect colonies can illustrate interactions between bacterial community composition and host behaviour. In many eusocial insect species, different workers exhibit different task behaviours. Evidence of compositional differences between core microbiota in different worker types could suggest a microbial association with the division of labour among workers. Here, we present the core microbiota of Aphaenogaster picea ant workers with different task behaviours. The genus Aphaenogaster is abundant worldwide, yet the associated microbiota of this group is unstudied. Bacterial communities from Aphaenogaster picea gut samples in this study consist of 19 phyla, dominated by Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria and Firmicutes. Analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences reveals distinct similarity clustering of Aphaenogaster picea gut bacterial communities in workers that have more interactions with the refuse piles. Though gut bacterial communities of nurse and foraging ants are similar in overall composition and structure, the worker groups differ in relative abundances of dominant taxa. Gut bacterial communities from ants that have more interactions with refuse piles are dominated by amplicon sequence variants associated with Entomoplasmataceae. Interaction with faecal matter via refuse piles seems to have the greatest impact on microbial taxa distribution, and this effect appears to be independent of worker type. This is the first report surveying the gut microbiome community composition of Aphaenogaster ants.",
  "Age-related changes in behavior and sensory perception have been observed in a wide variety of animal species. In ants and other eusocial insects, workers often progress through an ordered sequence of olfactory-driven behavioral tasks. Notably, these behaviors are plastic, and workers adapt and rapidly switch tasks in response to changing environmental conditions. In the Florida carpenter ant, smaller minors typically perform most of the work needed to maintain the colony, while the larger majors are specialized for nest defense and rarely engage in these routine tasks. Here, we investigate the effects of age and task group on olfactory responses to a series of odorant blends in minor and major worker castes. Consistent with their respective roles within the colony, we observed significant age-associated shifts in the olfactory responses of minors as they transitioned between behavioral states, whereas the responses of majors remained consistently low regardless of age. Furthermore, we have identified a unitary compound, 3-methylindole, which elicited significantly higher responses and behavioral aversion in minor nurses than in similarly aged foragers suggesting that this compound may play an important role in brood care. Taken together, our results suggest that age- and task-associated shifts in olfactory physiology may play a critical role in the social organization of ant colonies.",
  "UNLABELLED: Age-related changes in behavior and sensory perception have been observed in a wide variety of animal species.

Taken together, our results suggest that age- and task-associated shifts in olfactory physiology may play a critical role in the social organization of ant colonies. SIMPLE SUMMARY: Florida carpenter ants ( Camponotus floridanus ) live in colonies comprised of thousands of workers. The smallest workers, known as minors, engage in routine tasks such as nursing and foraging while the largest workers, known as majors, are thought to be soldiers specialized for defending the nest. How ant colonies allocate their workforce to address the dynamic and ever-changing needs of the colonies remains an open question in the field, but current evidence suggests that ant social behavior likely results from a combination of genetic/epigenetic, physiological, and systems-level processes. Here, we extend these studies by investigating the role of olfactory sensitivity in regulating ant behavior. Minor workers exhibited significant shifts in olfactory sensitivity and odor coding as they aged and switched tasks. The olfactory sensitivity of majors, however, remained relatively stable as they aged. From these studies, we also identified a single compound, 3-methylindole, which elicited significantly higher olfactory responses and aversive behavior in nurses compared to foragers, suggesting that this chemical may have a role in brood care. Overall, these studies support the hypothesis that changes in olfactory sensitivity play an important role in regulating social behavior in ants.",
  "Task allocation in ant colonies, mediated by social interactions, regulates which individuals perform which task and when they are active, in response to the current situation. Many tasks are performed in a daily temporal pattern. An ant's biological clock depends on the patterns of gene expression that are regulated using a negative feedback loop which is synchronized to the earth's rotation by external cues. An individual's biological clock can shift in response to social cues, and this plasticity contributes to task switching. Daily rhythms in individual ant behavior combine via interactions within and across task groups to adjust the collective behavior of colonies. Further work is needed to elucidate how the social cues, which lead to task switching, influence the molecular mechanisms that generate clock outputs associated with each task and to investigate the evolution of temporal patterns in task allocation in relation to ecological factors.",
  "Social insects are classic examples of cooperation and coordination. For instance, laboratory studies of colony relocation, or house-hunting, have investigated how workers coordinate their efforts to swiftly move the colony to the best nesting site available while preserving colony integrity, i.e. avoiding a split. However, several studies have shown that, in some other contexts, individuals may use private rather than social information and may act solitarily rather than in a coordinated way. Here, we study resource allocation by a mature ant colony when it reproduces by fissioning into several colonies. This is a very different task than house hunting in that colony fission seeks the split of the colony. We develop a simple individual-based model to test if colony fission and resource allocation may be carried out by workers acting solitarily with no coordination. Our model reproduces well the pattern of allocation observed in nature (number and size of new colonies). This does not show that workers do not communicate nor coordinate. Rather, it suggests that independent decision making may be an important component of the process of resource allocation.",
  "Spatial patterns of movement regulate many aspects of social insect behavior, because how workers move around, and how many are there, determines how often they meet and interact. Interactions are usually olfactory; for example, in ants, by means of antennal contact in which one worker assesses the cuticular hydrocarbons of another. Encounter rates may be a simple outcome of local density: a worker experiences more encounters, the more other workers there are around it. This means that encounter rate can be used as a cue for overall density even though no individual can assess global density. Encounter rate as a cue for local density regulates many aspects of social insect behavior, including collective search, task allocation, nest choice, and traffic flow. As colonies grow older and larger, encounter rates change, which leads to changes in task allocation. Nest size affects local density and movement patterns, which influences encounter rate, so that nest size and connectivity influence colony behavior. However, encounter rate is not a simple function of local density when individuals change their movement in response to encounters, thus influencing further encounter rates. Natural selection on the regulation of collective behavior can draw on variation within and among colonies in the relation of movement patterns, encounter rate, and response to encounters.",
  "Social insects are one of the best examples of complex self-organized systems exhibiting task allocation. How task allocation is achieved is the most fascinating question in behavioural ecology and complex systems science. However, it is difficult to comprehensively characterize task allocation patterns due to behavioural complexity, such as the individual variation, context dependency and chronological variation. Thus, it is imperative to quantify individual behaviours and integrate them into colony levels. Here, we applied bipartite network analyses to characterize individual-behaviour relationships. We recorded the behaviours of all individuals with verified age in ant colonies and analysed the individual-behaviour relationship at the individual, module and network levels. Bipartite network analysis successfully detected the module structures, illustrating that certain individuals performed a subset of behaviours (i.e. task groups). We confirmed age polyethism by comparing age between modules. Additionally, to test the daily rhythm of the executed tasks, the data were partitioned between daytime and nighttime, and a bipartite network was re-constructed. This analysis supported that there was no daily rhythm in the tasks performed. These findings suggested that bipartite network analyses could untangle complex task allocation patterns and provide insights into understanding the division of labour.",
  "Some ant species have multiple worker castes that differ in body size; workers in one caste remain in the colony and those in the other forage outside the colony (caste polyethism). In other species, all workers engage in both tasks, but the younger workers remain in the colony and the older workers forage (age polyethism). Here, we ask which of these two is the most efficient for colony level performance when foragers suffer a higher daily mortality than workers in the colony and when the optimal worker size differs between two tasks. We studied two models: in the stationary colony model, the colony size and composition remain constant, and the amount of excess resources that can be used for producing reproductive individuals is maximized; in the growing colony model, all of the resources obtained are used for producing new workers, and the rate of the colony growth is maximized. In both models, we observed similar results: caste polyethism is more advantageous than age polyethism if the difference in mortality between the two tasks is small and the difference in the optimal size is large. In the opposite situation, the age polyethism is more advantageous.",
  "Self-organizing biological systems, such as colonies of social insects, are characterized by their decentralized control and flexible responses to changing environments, often likened to swarm intelligence. Although decentralized control is well known to be a product of local interactions among agents, without the need for a bird's-eye view, indirect knowledge of properties that indicate the current states of the entire system also helps each agent to respond to changes, thereby leading to a more adaptive system. In this study, we analyze the rules that govern workers' behavioral responses to colony-level properties and assess whether they contribute to adaptive flexibility in social insect colonies. We focus on task allocation among red harvester ants (Pogonomyrmex barbatus) as a model system and develop an ordinary differential equation model to describe the system of task allocation among workers. We simulate 12 scenarios specifying how workers respond to changes in the colony-level properties of colony size and nutritional state. We found that when workers decrease their contact rates in response to increasing colony size, they enable achievement of a larger colony size, similar to that of P. barbatus colonies in nature, and when workers increase their foraging levels in response to decreasing colony-wide nutritional levels, they increase resilience to environmental disturbances. These negative feedback rules governing the response to colony-level properties are consistent with previous reports on ants and honeybees.",
  "The concept of response threshold (RT) has been developed to explain task allocation in social insect colonies, wherein individual workers engage in tasks depending on their responsiveness to the task-related stimulus. Moreover, a mathematical model of RT has been proposed to explain data obtained from task allocation experiments; however, its applicability range warrants clarification through adequate quantitative analysis. Hence, we used an automatic measuring system to count passage events between a nest chamber and a foraging arena in five colonies of ants, Camponotus japonicus. The events were measured using radio-frequency identification tags attached to all workers of each colony. Here, we examined the detailed forms of i) labour distribution during foraging among workers in each colony and ii) the persistence of rank-order of foraging among workers. We found that labour distribution was characterized by a generalized gamma-distribution, indicating that only few workers carried out a large part of the workload. The rank-order of foraging activity among workers in each colony was maintained for a month and collapsed within a few months. We compared the obtained data with testable predictions of the RT model. The comparison indicated that proper evaluation of the mathematical model is required based on the obtained data.",
  "Waste disposal is important for maintaining the health of animal societies. Adults and oﬀ ;spring produce large amounts of waste and feces that could contain pathogens or toxins and may need to be stored away from the young or adult individuals. In social insects, the worker caste is responsible for nest maintenance, including sanitary behavior, and waste disposal strategies vary between species. However, individual task allocation is generally affected by queen presence and worker efficiency often decreases in the absence of a queen. Here we show that most (74%) colonies of the cavity-dwelling ant Temnothorax crassispinus construct up to two localized indoor 'latrines', which are used for defecation and only very rarely also as waste dumps. Restriction of defecation to designated areas affects the growth of mold inside the nest. Defecation strategies of colonies are furthermore affected by queen presence, with workers from queenless nests more frequently defecating outside the nest and forming latrines. As colonies do not actively avoid moldy nests, mold seems to not necessarily be a threat to the colony. While solid waste management has been more extensively studied in social insects, this study contributes a rare insight into the organization of non-easily transportable fecal waste.",
  "Many ant species use distributed population density estimation in applications ranging from quorum sensing, to task allocation, to appraisal of enemy colony strength. It has been shown that ants estimate local population density by tracking encounter rates: The higher the density, the more often the ants bump into each other. We study distributed density estimation from a theoretical perspective. We prove that a group of anonymous agents randomly walking on a grid are able to estimate their density within a small multiplicative error in few steps by measuring their rates of encounter with other agents. Despite dependencies inherent in the fact that nearby agents may collide repeatedly (and, worse, cannot recognize when this happens), our bound nearly matches what would be required to estimate density by independently sampling grid locations. From a biological perspective, our work helps shed light on how ants and other social insects can obtain relatively accurate density estimates via encounter rates. From a technical perspective, our analysis provides tools for understanding complex dependencies in the collision probabilities of multiple random walks. We bound the strength of these dependencies using local mixing properties of the underlying graph. Our results extend beyond the grid to more general graphs, and we discuss applications to size estimation for social networks, density estimation for robot swarms, and random walk-based sampling for sensor networks.",
  "BACKGROUND: The performance and fitness of social societies mainly depends on the efficiency of interactions between reproductive individuals and helpers. Helpers need to react to the group's requirements and to adjust their tasks accordingly, while the reproductive individual has to adjust its reproductive rate. Social insects provide a good system to study the interrelations between individual and group characteristics. In general, sterile workers focus on brood care and foraging while the queen lays eggs. Reproductive division of labor is determined by caste and not interchangeable as, e.g., in social mammals or birds. Hence, changing social and environmental conditions require a flexible response by each caste. In the ant Cardiocondyla obscurior, worker task allocation is based on age polyethism, with young workers focusing on brood care and old workers on foraging. Here, we examine how group age demography affects colony performance and fitness in colonies consisting of only old or young workers and a single old or young queen. We hypothesized that both groups will be fully functional, but that the forced task shift affects the individuals' performance. Moreover, we expected reduced worker longevity in groups with only young workers due to precocious foraging but no effect on queen longevity depending on group composition. RESULTS: Neither the performance of queens nor that of workers declined strongly with time per se, but offspring number and weight were influenced by queen age and the interaction between queen and worker age. Individual residual life expectancy strongly depended on colony demography instead of physiological age. While worker age affected queen longevity only slightly, exposing old workers to the conditions of colony founding increased their life spans by up to 50% relative to workers that had emerged shortly before colony set-up. CONCLUSIONS: The social environment strongly affected the tempo of aging and senescence in C. obscurior, highlighting the plasticity of life expectancy in social insects. Furthermore, colonies obtained the highest reproductive output when consisting of same-aged queens and workers independent of their physiological age. However, workers appeared to be able to adjust their behavior to the colony's needs and not to suffer from age-dependent restrictions.",
  "Collective foraging confers benefits in terms of reduced predation risk and access to social information, but it heightens local competition when resources are limited. In social insects, resource limitation has been suggested as a possible cause for the typical decrease in per capita productivity observed with increasing colony size, a phenomenon known as Michener's paradox. Polydomy (distribution of a colony's brood and workers across multiple nests) is believed to help circumvent this paradox through its positive effect on foraging efficiency, but there is still little supporting evidence for this hypothesis. Here, we show experimentally that polydomy enhances the foraging performance of food-deprived Temnothorax nylanderi ant colonies via several mechanisms. First, polydomy influences task allocation within colonies, resulting in faster retrieval of protein resources. Second, communication between sister nests reduces search times for far away resources. Third, colonies move queens, brood and workers across available nest sites in response to spatial heterogeneities in protein and carbohydrate resources. This suggests that polydomy represents a flexible mechanism for space occupancy, helping ant colonies adjust to the environment.",
  "Task allocation among social insect workers is an ideal framework for studying the molecular mechanisms underlying behavioural plasticity because workers of similar genotype adopt different behavioural phenotypes. Elegant laboratory studies have pioneered this effort, but field studies involving the genetic regulation of task allocation are rare. Here, we investigate the expression of the foraging gene in harvester ant workers from five age- and task-related groups in a natural population, and we experimentally test how exposure to light affects foraging expression in brood workers and foragers. Results from our field study show that the regulation of the foraging gene in harvester ants occurs at two time scales: levels of foraging mRNA are associated with ontogenetic changes over weeks in worker age, location and task, and there are significant daily oscillations in foraging expression in foragers. The temporal dissection of foraging expression reveals that gene expression changes in foragers occur across a scale of hours and the level of expression is predicted by activity rhythms: foragers have high levels of foraging mRNA during daylight hours when they are most active outside the nests. In the experimental study, we find complex interactions in foraging expression between task behaviour and light exposure. Oscillations occur in foragers following experimental exposure to 13 L : 11 D (LD) conditions, but not in brood workers under similar conditions. No significant differences were seen in foraging expression over time in either task in 24 h dark (DD) conditions. Interestingly, the expression of foraging in both undisturbed field and experimentally treated foragers is also significantly correlated with the expression of the circadian clock gene, cycle Our results provide evidence that the regulation of this gene is context-dependent and associated with both ontogenetic and daily behavioural plasticity in field colonies of harvester ants. Our results underscore the importance of assaying temporal patterns in behavioural gene expression and suggest that gene regulation is an integral mechanism associated with behavioural plasticity in harvester ants.",
  "We develop a model to produce plausible patterns of task partitioning in the ponerine ant Ectatomma ruidum based on the availability of living prey and prey corpses. The model is based on the organizational capabilities of a \"common stomach\" through which the colony utilizes the availability of a natural (food) substance as a major communication channel to regulate the income and expenditure of the very same substance. This communication channel has also a central role in regulating task partitioning of collective hunting behavior in a supply&demand-driven manner. Our model shows that task partitioning of the collective hunting behavior in E. ruidum can be explained by regulation due to a common stomach system. The saturation of the common stomach provides accessible information to individual ants so that they can adjust their hunting behavior accordingly by engaging in or by abandoning from stinging or transporting tasks. The common stomach is able to establish and to keep stabilized an effective mix of workforce to exploit the prey population and to transport food into the nest. This system is also able to react to external perturbations in a de-centralized homeostatic way, such as to changes in the prey density or to accumulation of food in the nest. In case of stable conditions the system develops towards an equilibrium concerning colony size and prey density. Our model shows that organization of work through a common stomach system can allow Ectatomma ruidum to collectively forage for food in a robust, reactive and reliable way. The model is compared to previously published models that followed a different modeling approach. Based on our model analysis we also suggest a series of experiments for which our model gives plausible predictions. These predictions are used to formulate a set of testable hypotheses that should be investigated empirically in future experimentation.",
  "Differing task thresholds among workers are crucial to the efficient allocation of work in self-organized insect colonies. New evidence suggests that the rearing temperature of ant pupae causes lifelong changes in an ant's response threshold to temperature.",
  "BACKGROUND: Recent advances in sociogenomics allow for comparative analyses of molecular mechanisms regulating the development of social behavior. In eusocial insects, one key aspect of their sociality, the division of labor, has received the most attention. Age-related polyethism, a derived form of division of labor in ants and bees where colony tasks are allocated among distinct behavioral phenotypes, has traditionally been assumed to be a product of convergent evolution. Previous work has shown that the circadian clock is associated with the development of behavior and division of labor in honeybee societies. We cloned the ortholog of the clock gene, period, from a harvester ant (Pogonomyrmex occidentalis) and examined circadian rhythms and daily activity patterns in a species that represents an evolutionary origin of eusociality independent of the honeybee. RESULTS: Using real time qPCR analyses, we determined that harvester ants have a daily cyclic expression of period and this rhythm is endogenous (free-running under dark-dark conditions). Cyclic expression of period is task-specific; foragers have strong daily fluctuations but nest workers inside the nest do not. These patterns correspond to differences in behavior as activity levels of foragers show a diurnal pattern while nest workers tend to exhibit continuous locomotor activity at lower levels. In addition, we found that foragers collected in the early fall (relative warm, long days) exhibit a delay in the nightly peak of period expression relative to foragers collected in the early spring (relative cold, short days). CONCLUSION: The association of period mRNA expression levels with harvester ant task behaviors suggests that the development of circadian rhythms is associated with the behavioral development of ants. Thus, the circadian clock pathway may represent a conserved 'genetic toolkit' that has facilitated the parallel evolution of age-related polyethism and task allocation in social insects.",
  "The ecological success of social insects is often attributed to an increase in efficiency achieved through division of labor between workers in a colony. Much research has therefore focused on the mechanism by which a division of labor is implemented, i.e., on how tasks are allocated to workers. However, the important assumption that specialists are indeed more efficient at their work than generalist individuals--the \"Jack-of-all-trades is master of none\" hypothesis--has rarely been tested. Here, I quantify worker efficiency, measured as work completed per time, in four different tasks in the ant Temnothorax albipennis: honey and protein foraging, collection of nest-building material, and brood transports in a colony emigration. I show that individual efficiency is not predicted by how specialized workers were on the respective task. Worker efficiency is also not consistently predicted by that worker's overall activity or delay to begin the task. Even when only the worker's rank relative to nestmates in the same colony was used, specialization did not predict efficiency in three out of the four tasks, and more specialized workers actually performed worse than others in the fourth task (collection of sand grains). I also show that the above relationships, as well as median individual efficiency, do not change with colony size. My results demonstrate that in an ant species without morphologically differentiated worker castes, workers may nevertheless differ in their ability to perform different tasks. Surprisingly, this variation is not utilized by the colony--worker allocation to tasks is unrelated to their ability to perform them. What, then, are the adaptive benefits of behavioral specialization, and why do workers choose tasks without regard for whether they can perform them well? We are still far from an understanding of the adaptive benefits of division of labor in social insects.",
  "We investigated the influence of juvenile hormones (JH) on the composition of cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) and the division of labor in colonies of the African ant Myrmicaria eumenoides. CHCs have long been implicated in nestmate recognition in social insect colonies. In M. eumenoides, the CHC profiles also vary with the task performed from brood-tender-type to forager type. The endocrine factors regulating the task allocation as well as the intracolonial recognition cues are not well understood, but JHs are prime candidates. Only JH III was identified in the hemolymph of M. eumenoides workers. Foragers had significantly higher JH III titers than brood tenders. The application of exogenous JH III and a JH analogue (methoprene) to M. eumenoides workers did not result in an observable acceleration of task change in our study. However, longevity of the focus workers, and thus the observational period, was reduced by the applications. Changes from a brood-tender-type to a forager-type CHC profile were accelerated by the application of JH III and methoprene, resulting in brood-tending workers that displayed forager-type CHC profiles. We present the first data supporting that recognition cues of an eusocial Hymenopteran are influenced by JH III, which could thus play a major role in the regulation of the dynamic nature of social insect colonies. JH III is connected to at least two key processes: the acceleration of CHC changes and the more long-term modulation of task shifting. Moreover, this indicates that changes in CHC recognition cues do not trigger task allocation in social insect colonies.",
  "Social insect colonies respond to challenges set by a variable environment by re-allocating work among colony members. In many social insects, such colony-level task allocation strategies are achieved through individual decisions that produce a self-organized adapting group. We investigated colony responses to parasitoid and native ant competitors in the red imported fire ant ( Solenopsis invicta). Parasitoid flies affected fire ants by decreasing the proportion of workers engaged in foraging. Competitors also altered colony-level behaviours by reducing the proportion of foraging ants and by increasing the proportion of roaming majors, whose role is colony defence. Interestingly, the presence of both parasitism and competition almost always had similar effects on task allocation in comparison to each of the biotic factors on its own. Thus, our study uniquely demonstrates that the interactive effect of both parasitism and competition is not necessarily additive, implying that these biotic factors alter colony behaviour in distinct ways. More generally, our work demonstrates the importance of studying the dynamics of species interactions in a broader context.",
  "Driver ants ( Dorylus spp.) show a high degree of worker polymorphism. Previous reports suggest that large Dorylus workers are specialised for defensive tasks. In this study, we first quantitatively tested whether there is a size-correlated division of defensive labour among workers. Second, we determined whether the spatial distribution of workers outside the nest can be predicted based on such size-specific differences in task allocation. We show that the division of defensive behaviour among different-sized workers is not strict. However, there is a significant correlation between worker size and the tendency to carry out defensive tasks. First, workers of larger size were more likely than smaller workers to participate in colony defence. Second, larger workers were more frequent near the nest containing the reproducing individuals and the brood. Finally, large workers were more common in open sections of the trail than in covered sections, which are likely to be less exposed to predators.",
  "In theory, larger colonies of social insects should have greater colony organisation. While inter-specific comparative studies provide support for this idea, there is little direct intra-specific evidence. We investigated differences in task specialisation between large (>450 workers) and small (<80 workers) colonies of the ponerine ant Rhytidoponera metallica. Observations of individually marked young or old workers revealed greater task specialisation in large colonies. Age polyethism was detected in large but not small colonies. In large colonies, old workers spent significantly more time foraging than young workers did, while young workers spent more time caring for brood. In small colonies, young and old workers spent a similar amount of time foraging and caring for brood. This difference in task allocation patterns in large and small colonies was associated with a difference in contact rates between workers. Workers in small colonies have a lower contact rate between nestmates and a greater variability in time between contacts than workers from large colonies.",
  "Sorting can be an important mechanism for the transfer of information from one level of biological organization to another. Here we study the algorithm underlying worker sorting in Leptothorax ant colonies. Worker sorting is related to task allocation and therefore to the adaptive advantages associated with an efficient system for the division of labour in ant colonies. We considered four spatially explicit individual-based models founded on two-dimensional correlated random walk. Our aim was to establish whether sorting at the level of the worker population could occur with minimal assumptions about the behavioural algorithm of individual workers. The behaviour of an individual worker in the models could be summarized by the rule \"move if you can, turn always\". We assume that the turning angle of a worker is individually specific and negatively dependent on the magnitude of an internal parameter micro which could be regarded as a measure of individual experience or task specialization. All four models attained a level of worker sortedness that was compatible with results from experiments onLeptothorax ant colonies. We found that the presence of a sorting pivot, such as the nest wall or an attraction force towards the centre of the worker population, was crucial for sorting. We make a distinction between such pivots and templates and discuss the biological implications of their difference.",
  "Aggregation is one of the most basic social phenomena, and many activities of social insects are linked to it. For instance, the selection of a valuable site and the spatial organization of the population are very often by-products of amplifications based on the local density of nestmates. The patterns of aggregation are very diverse, ranging from the gathering of all animals in a unique site to their splitting between several ones. One might question how these multiple patterns emerge. Do ants actively initiate the formation of such patterns by modulating the emission of an attracting signal such as the trail pheromone? Alternatively, do patterns result from quantitative changes in the duration of interaction between animals once they have reached the gathering site, without any active modulation of the communications? To discuss these questions, we present two empirical studies: the gregarious behavior of cockroaches (Blatella) and self-assembly in the weaver ant (Oecophylla). Through experimental and theoretical studies, we show how a single behavior-the resting time-leads to a collective choice in both species. This behavior is a response to the density of conspecifics and can also be modulated by heterogeneities in the environment. In weaver ants, it allows the colony to focus the formation of chains in a given area among several potential sites. In cockroaches, it allows the gathering of individuals in particular shelters, depending on the proximity between strains. These results are discussed with emphasis on the role of aggregation processes in the emergence of cooperativity and task allocation.",
  "In many network models of interacting units such as cells or insects, the coupling coefficients between units are independent of the state of the units. Here we analyze the temporal behavior of units that can switch between two 'category' states according to rules that involve category-dependent coupling coefficients. The behaviors of the category populations resulting from the asynchronous random updating of units are first classified according to the signs of the coupling coefficients using numerical simulations. They range from isolated fixed points to lines of fixed points and stochastic attractors. These behaviors are then explained analytically using iterated function systems and birth-death jump processes. The main inspiration for our work comes from studies of non-hierarchical task allocation in, e.g., harvester ant colonies where temporal fluctuations in the numbers of ants engaged in various tasks occur as circumstances require and depend on interactions between ants. We identify interaction types that produce quick recovery from perturbations to an asymptotic behavior whose characteristics are function of the coupling coefficients between ants as well as between ants and their environment. We also compute analytically the probability density of the population numbers, and show that perturbations in our model decay twice as fast as in a model with random switching dynamics. A subset of the interaction types between ants yields intrinsic stochastic asymptotic behaviors which could account for some of the experimentally observed fluctuations. Such noisy trajectories are shown to be random walks with state-dependent biases in the 'category population' phase space. With an external stimulus, the parameters of the category-switching rules become time-dependent. Depending on the growth rate of the stimulus in comparison to its population-dependent decay rate, the dynamics may qualitatively differ from the case without stimulus. Our simple two-category model provides a framework for understanding the rich variety of behaviors in network dynamics with state-dependent coupling coefficients, and especially in task allocation processes with many tasks.",
  "One of the greatest challenges in robotics is to create machines that are able to interact with unpredictable environments in real time. A possible solution may be to use swarms of robots behaving in a self-organized manner, similar to workers in an ant colony. Efficient mechanisms of division of labour, in particular series-parallel operation and transfer of information among group members, are key components of the tremendous ecological success of ants. Here we show that the general principles regulating division of labour in ant colonies indeed allow the design of flexible, robust and effective robotic systems. Groups of robots using ant-inspired algorithms of decentralized control techniques foraged more efficiently and maintained higher levels of group energy than single robots. But the benefits of group living decreased in larger groups, most probably because of interference during foraging. Intriguingly, a similar relationship between group size and efficiency has been documented in social insects. Moreover, when food items were clustered, groups where robots could recruit other robots in an ant-like manner were more efficient than groups without information transfer, suggesting that group dynamics of swarms of robots may follow rules similar to those governing social insects.",
  "Social inequality among individuals is a common cause of conflict in the animal kingdom. In eusocial insects, such as ants, bees, wasps, and termites, for example, the large differences in reproductive potential between castes result in conflicts over caste fate during development. Here, we present the first comprehensive review on caste fate conflict, drawing on data from diverse taxa and recent theoretical advances. In many eusocial species, caste fate is determined by differential feeding, which results in caste fate being socially controlled, thereby aligning larval development with the collective needs of the colony. However, in some taxa, mechanisms of individual self-determination disrupt this balance, leading to overproduction of reproductive individuals at the expense of workers, with significant costs to colony fitness. Such conflicts are particularly pronounced in some stingless bees and lower termites, where larvae can bypass social control to determine their own caste fate. Indications of caste conflict can also be found in other groups, such as in some parasitic ants and in ant hybrid zones. Overall, the observed dynamics illustrate how conflicts in biological systems can be resolved in favour of either individual or collective interests, and how this affects the functioning of higher levels of organisation.",
  "The red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta Buren) is a social pest species with a robust reproductive ability that causes extensive damage. Identification of the genes involved in queen fertility is critical in order to better understand the reproductive biology and screening for the potential molecular targets in S. invicta. Here, we used the mRNA deep sequencing (RNA-seq) approach to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the transcriptomes of three reproductive caste types of S. invicta, including queen (QA) and winged female (FA) and male (MA) ants. The genes that were specific to and highly expressed in the queens were then screened, and the Vg2 and Vg3 genes were chosen as targets to explore their functions in oogenesis and fertility. A minimum of 6.08 giga bases (Gb) of clean reads was obtained from all samples, with a mapping rate > 89.78%. There were 7524, 7133, and 977 DEGs identified in the MA vs. QA, MA vs. FA, and FA vs. QA comparisons, respectively. qRT-PCR was used to validate 10 randomly selected DEGs, including vitellogenin 2 (Vg2) and 3 (Vg3), and their expression patterns were mostly consistent with the RNA-seq data. The S. invicta Vgs included conserved domains and motifs that are commonly found in most insect Vgs. SiVg2 and SiVg3 were highly expressed in queens and winged females and were most highly expressed in the thorax, followed by the fat body, head, and epidermis. Evaluation based on a loss-of-function-based knockdown analysis showed that the downregulation of either or both of these genes resulted in smaller ovaries, less oogenesis, and less egg production. The results of transcriptional sequencing provide a foundation for clarifying the regulators of queen fertility in S. invicta. The functions of SiVg2 and SiVg3 as regulators of oogenesis highlight their importance in queen fecundity and their potential as targets of reproductive disruption in S. invicta control.",
  "Cooperative breeding entails conflicts over reproductive shares that may be settled in different ways. In ants, where several queens simultaneously reproduce in a colony, both queens and workers may influence the reproductive apportionment and offspring quality. Queens may vary in their intrinsic fecundity, which may influence the size of the worker entourage attending individual queens, and this may eventually dictate the reproductive output of a queen. We tested whether the reproductive success of queens is affected by the size of their worker entourage, their fecundity at the onset of the reproductive season, and whether the queen cuticular hydrocarbon profile carries information on fecundity. We show that in the ant Formica fusca both queen fecundity and egg hatching success increase with the size of their entourage, and that newly hatched larvae produced by initially highly fecund queens are smaller. Furthermore, higher relatedness among workers increased queen fecundity. Finally, the queens that received a large worker entourage differed in the cuticular chemistry from those that received a small worker entourage. Our results thus show that workers play a pivotal role in determining queen fitness, that high intracolony relatedness among workers enhances the overall reproductive output in the colony, and that queen fecundity is reflected in their cuticular hydrocarbon profile.",
  "The association of unrelated ant queens (pleometrosis) is supposed to improve nest foundation and competitiveness under environmental stress, but its evolutionary maintenance is difficult to explain because only one of the queens survives after nest foundation. My aim was to test the potential effect of queen association as a social buffer, that is, as a mechanism reducing stress and improving fitness due to the benefits of social contact. I analyzed the survival, fecundity, and behavior of isolated and paired Lasius flavus queens exposed and not exposed to stressors (disturbing environmental conditions). I found no difference in survivorship between isolated and paired queens or between stressed and unstressed isolated queens. Groups in which 1 or 2 paired queens were stressed showed higher mortality. Unstressed queens died similarly to their stressed nestmates, suggesting stress transmission. A trend suggested that paired queens produced eggs more quickly, but eggs were produced similarly between isolated and paired queens. Social avoidance was observed in groups with 1 stressed and 1 unstressed queen. However, the groups with 2 stressed queens showed the expected behaviors according to social buffering: lower mobility and more interindividual inspection. My findings suggest the synergistic effect of pleometrosis and stress and the dependence of stress level similarity between nestmates on social buffering or rejection on ant queens.",
  "Parthenogenetic reproduction is a common feature for social Hymenoptera, as males typically develop from unfertilized eggs (arrhenotoky). Production of female offspring without the involvement of sperm (thelytoky) also exists but is rather exceptional as it has been reported for only 16 ant species so far. Three of these belong to the genus Strumigenys: S. hexamera, S. membranifera and S. rogeri. Our observations on the reproductive biology in various Oriental Strumigenys species extends this list of thelytokous ants with three more species: S. emmae, S. liukueiensis and S. solifontis. Of these six thelotykous species, S. emmae, S. membranifera and S. rogeri are known as tramp species. Reproduction without the need to fertilize eggs no doubt offers these species a considerable advantage when establishing colonies in new environments. Published histological data on S. hexamera and S. membranifera already showed that the queens possess a functional spermatheca. We now provide evidence that this is also the case for the four other thelytokous Strumigenys species. Retaining a functional spermatheca and reproductive system may keep the queens ready for the exceptional event of mating and hence increase genetic variability, as males do occur very rarely.",
  "Within social insect colonies, microbiomes often differ between castes due to their different functional roles and between colony locations. Trachymyrmex septentrionalis fungus-growing ants form colonies throughout the eastern United States and northern Mexico that include workers, female and male alates (unmated reproductive castes), larvae, and pupae. How T. septentrionalis microbiomes vary across this geographic range and between castes is unknown. Our sampling of individual ants from colonies across the eastern United States revealed a conserved T. septentrionalis worker ant microbiome and revealed that worker ant microbiomes are more conserved within colonies than between them. A deeper sampling of individual ants from two colonies that included all available castes (pupae, larvae, workers, and female and male alates), from both before and after adaptation to controlled laboratory conditions, revealed that ant microbiomes from each colony, caste, and rearing condition were typically conserved within but not between each sampling category. Tenericute bacterial symbionts were especially abundant in these ant microbiomes and varied widely in abundance between sampling categories. This study demonstrates how individual insect colonies primarily drive the composition of their microbiomes and shows that these microbiomes are further modified by developmental differences between insect castes and the different environmental conditions experienced by each colony. IMPORTANCE This study investigates microbiome assembly in the fungus-growing ant Trachymyrmex septentrionalis, showing how colony, caste, and lab adaptation influence the microbiome and revealing unique patterns of mollicute symbiont abundance. We find that ant microbiomes differ strongly between colonies but less so within colonies. Microbiomes of different castes and following lab adaptation also differ in a colony-specific manner. This study advances our understanding of the nature of individuality in social insect microbiomes and cautions against the common practice of only sampling a limited number of populations to understand microbiome diversity and function.",
  "Sexually reproducing organisms usually invest equally in male and female offspring. Deviations from this pattern have led researchers to new discoveries in the study of parent-offspring conflict, genomic conflict, and cooperative breeding. Some social insect species exhibit the unusual population-level pattern of split sex ratio, wherein some colonies specialize in the production of future queens and others specialize in the production of males. Theoretical work predicted that worker control of sex ratio and variation in relatedness asymmetry among colonies would cause each colony to specialize in the production of one sex. While some empirical tests supported theoretical predictions, others deviated from them, leaving many questions about how split sex ratio emerges. One factor yet to be investigated is whether colony sex ratio may be influenced by the genotypes of queens or workers. Here, we sequence the genomes of 138 Formica glacialis workers from 34 male-producing and 34 gyne-producing colonies to determine whether split sex ratio is under genetic control. We identify a supergene spanning 5.5 Mbp that is closely associated with sex allocation in this system. Strikingly, this supergene is adjacent to another supergene spanning 5 Mbp that is associated with variation in colony queen number. We identify a similar pattern in a second related species, Formica podzolica. The discovery that split sex ratio is determined, at least in part, by a supergene in two species opens future research on the evolutionary drivers of split sex ratio.",
  "Sexually antagonistic selection (SAS) occurs when distinct alleles are differentially selected in each sex. In the invasive tawny crazy ant, Nylanderia fulva, a genomic region is under SAS, while the rest of the genome is randomly selected in males and females. In this study, we designed a suite of 15 microsatellite markers to study the origin and evolution of SAS in N. fulva. These SAS markers were polymorphic, with allelic frequencies that are highly different between males and females. All haploid males carry only a subset of the alleles present in the population, while females are reliably heterozygous, with one allele from the male gene pool and a different allele inherited from their mother. In addition, we identified six polymorphic markers not associated with SAS and six markers yielding consistent, yet monomorphic, amplification in the introduced range of this species. Reaction condition optimizations allowed all retained markers to be co-amplified in four PCR mixes. The SAS markers may be used to test for the strength and the extent of the genomic regions under SAS in both the native and introduced ranges of N. fulva, while the set of non-SAS loci may be used to assess the invasion route of this species. Overall, the application of these microsatellite markers will yield insights into the origin and evolution of SAS within and among species of the genus Nylanderia.",
  "Social life and isolation pose a complex suite of challenges to organisms prompting significant changes in neural state. However, plasticity in how brains respond to social challenges remains largely unexplored. The fire ants Solenopsis invicta provide an ideal scenario for examining this. Fire ant queens may found colonies individually or in groups of up to 30 queens, depending on key factors such as density of newly mated queens and availability of nesting sites. We artificially manipulated availability of nesting sites to test how the brain responds to social versus solitary colony founding at two key timepoints (early vs. late colony founding) and to group size (large vs. small groups). We adopted a powerful neurogenomic approach to identify even subtle differences of gene expression between treatment groups, and we built a global gene co-expression network of the fire ant brain to identify gene modules specifically associated with the different components of the social environment. The difference between group and single founding queens involves only one gene when founding behavior is still plastic and queens can switch from one modality to another, while hundreds of genes are involved later in the process, when behaviors have lost the initial plasticity and are more canalized. Furthermore, we find that large groups are associated with greater changes in gene expression than small groups, showing that even potentially subtle differences in the social environment can be linked to different neurogenomic states.",
  "Aphids are associated with an array of symbionts that have diverse ecological and evolutionary effects on their hosts. To date, symbiont communities of most aphid species are still poorly characterized, especially for the social aphids. In this study, high-throughput 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing was used to assess the bacterial communities of the social aphid Pseudoregma bambucicola, and the differences in bacterial diversity with respect to ant attendance and time series were also assessed. We found that the diversity of symbionts in P. bambucicola was low and three dominant symbionts (Buchnera, Pectobacterium and Wolbachia) were stably coexisting. Pectobacterium may help P. bambucicola feed on the hard bamboo stems, and genetic distance analysis suggests that the Pectobacterium in P. bambucicola may be a new symbiont species. Wolbachia may be associated with the transition of reproduction mode or has a nutritional role in P. bambucicola. Statistical tests on the diversity of bacterial communities in P. bambucicola suggest that aphid populations attended by ants usually have a significantly higher evenness than populations without ant attendance but there was no significant difference among aphid populations from different seasons.",
  "BACKGROUND: Worker reproduction has an important influence on the social cohesion and efficiency of social insect colonies, but its role in the success of invasive ants has been neglected. We used observations of 233 captive colonies, laboratory experiments, and genetic analyses to investigate the conditions for worker reproduction in the invasive Anoplolepis gracilipes (yellow crazy ant) and its potential cost on interspecific defence. We determined the prevalence of worker production of males and whether it is triggered by queen absence; whether physogastric workers with enlarged abdomens are more likely to be reproductive, how normal workers and physogastric workers compare in their contributions to foraging and defence; and whether worker-produced males and males that could have been queen- or worker-produced differ in their size and heterozygosity. RESULTS: Sixty-six of our 233 captive colonies produced males, and in 25 of these, some males could only have been produced by workers. Colonies with more workers were more likely to produce males, especially for queenless colonies. The average number of days between the first appearance of eggs and adult males in our colonies was 54.1 ± 10.2 (mean ± SD, n = 20). In our laboratory experiment, queen removal triggered an increase in the proportion of physogastric workers. Physogastric workers were more likely to have yolky oocytes (37-54.9%) than normal workers (2-25.6%), which is an indicator of fertile or trophic egg production. Physogastric workers were less aggressive during interspecific aggression tests and foraged less than normal workers. The head width and wing length of worker-produced males were on average 4.0 and 4.3% greater respectively than those of males of undetermined source. Our microsatellite DNA analyses indicate that 5.5% of worker-produced males and 14.3% of males of undetermined source were heterozygous, which suggests the presence of diploid males and/or genetic mosaics in A. gracilipes. CONCLUSIONS: Our experimental work provides crucial information on worker reproduction in A. gracilipes and its potential cost to colony defence. The ability of A. gracilipes workers to produce males in the absence of queens may also contribute to its success as an invasive species if intranidal mating can take place between virgin queens and worker-produced males.",
  "Workers in many species of social insects are capable of laying unfertilized eggs, which can develop into haploid males. This causes a conflict about male parentage between queens and workers. In a few species, this may result in matricide, that is, workers kill the colony's queen. Queen killing has so far been observed mainly in multi-queen colonies or in annual species, when the queen's fecundity declines at the end of the reproductive period. Here, we report queen expulsion and matricide in a monogynous, monandrous ant with perennial societies. Workers were seen to aggressively expel both related and unrelated queens from their nest shortly after the end of hibernation. Queen expulsion and matricide led to a significant decrease in the number of workers and brood, but eventually increased the direct fitness of workers through significant male production. Long-term observations revealed a short lifespan of queens, while workers in orphaned colonies survived and produced male offspring over several years.",
  "In social species, the presence of several reproductive individuals can generate conflict. In social insects, as queen number increases, individual oviposition rate may decrease because of direct and indirect behavioural and/or chemical interactions. Understanding the factors that mediate differences in queen fecundity should provide insight into the regulation and maintenance of highly polygynous insect societies, such as those of the invasive Argentine ant (Linepithema humile). In this study, we investigated (1) whether differences in the oviposition rates of Argentine ant queens exposed to polygynous conditions could result from interactions among them; (2) whether such differences in fecundity stemmed from differences in worker attention; and (3) whether polygynous conditions affected the cuticular hydrocarbon profiles of queens (CHCs). We found that differences in queen fecundity and CHC profiles observed under polygynous conditions disappeared when queens were exposed to monogynous conditions, suggesting some form of reproductive inhibition may exist when queens cohabit. These differences did not seem to arise from variation in worker attention because more fecund queens were not more attractive to workers. Levels of some CHCs were higher in more fecund queens. These CHCs are associated with greater queen productivity and survival. Our findings indicate that such compounds could be multifunctional queen pheromones.",
  "Genetic diversity acts as a reservoir for potential adaptations, yet selection tends to reduce this diversity over generations. However, sexually antagonistic selection (SAS) may promote diversity by selecting different alleles in each sex. SAS arises when an allele is beneficial to one sex but harmful to the other. Usually, the evolution of sex chromosomes allows each sex to independently reach different optima, thereby circumventing the constraint of a shared autosomal genome. Because the X chromosome is found twice as often in females than males, it represents a hot spot for SAS, offering a refuge for recessive male-beneficial but female-costly alleles. Hymenopteran species do not have sex chromosomes; females are diploid and males are haploid, with sex usually determined by heterozygosity at the complementary sex-determining locus. For this reason, their entire genomes display an X-linked pattern, as every chromosome is found twice as often in females than in males, which theoretically predisposes them to SAS in large parts of their genome. Here we report an instance of sexual divergence in the Hymenoptera, a sexually reproducing group that lacks sex chromosomes. In the invasive ant Nylanderia fulva, a postzygotic SAS leads daughters to preferentially carry alleles from their mothers and sons to preferentially carry alleles from their grandfathers for a substantial region (∼3%) of the genome. This mechanism results in nearly all females being heterozygous at these regions and maintains diversity throughout the population, which may mitigate the effects of a genetic bottleneck following introduction to an exotic area and enhance the invasion success of this ant.",
  "Competition among queens in polygynous societies may result in queen executions or conflicts over personal reproduction. Understanding the factors that mediate the executions of ant queens should provide insight into how queen numbers are regulated in polygynous insect societies. The Argentine ant is a widespread invasive species that displays secondary polygyny, and workers execute 90% of their nestmate queens each spring. In this study, we investigated: (1) whether ambient temperature, queen number, and protein deprivation have an effect on queen executions and (2) whether workers select the queens slated for execution based on their cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) profiles. We found that the percentage of queens executed was positively correlated with temperature and queen number but that protein deprivation did not play a role. As for queen fate, the levels of some CHCs were higher in surviving queens. One of these CHCs is associated with queen productivity (i.e egg-laying rate and ovarian index) suggesting that workers execute the least productive queens. Our findings suggest that chemical cues related to fertility signaling may mediate queen executions in Argentine ants.",
  "All social insects with obligate reproductive division of labor evolved from strictly monogamous ancestors, but multiple queen-mating (polyandry) arose de novo, in several evolutionarily derived lineages. Polyandrous ant queens are inseminated soon after hatching and store sperm mixtures for a potential reproductive life of decades. However, they cannot re-mate later in life and are thus expected to control the loss of viable sperm because their lifetime reproductive success is ultimately sperm limited. In the leaf-cutting ant Atta colombica,, the survival of newly inseminated sperm is known to be compromised by seminal fluid of rival males and to be protected by secretions of the queen sperm storage organ (spermatheca). Here we investigate the main protein-level interactions that appear to mediate sperm competition dynamics and sperm preservation. We conducted an artificial insemination experiment and DIGE-based proteomics to identify proteomic changes when seminal fluid is exposed to spermathecal fluid followed by a mass spectrometry analysis of both secretions that allowed us to identify the sex-specific origins of the proteins that had changed in abundance. We found that spermathecal fluid targets only seven (2%) of the identified seminal fluid proteins for degradation, including two proteolytic serine proteases, a SERPIN inhibitor, and a semen-liquefying acid phosphatase. In vitro, and in vivo, experiments provided further confirmation that these proteins are key molecules mediating sexual conflict over sperm competition and viability preservation during sperm storage. In vitro, exposure to spermathecal fluid reduced the capacity of seminal fluid to compromise survival of rival sperm in a matter of hours and biochemical inhibition of these seminal fluid proteins largely eliminated that adverse effect. Our findings indicate that A. colombica, queens are in control of sperm competition and sperm storage, a capacity that has not been documented in other animals but is predicted to have independently evolved in other polyandrous social insects.",
  "BACKGROUND: Promiscuous mating and sperm competition often induce arms races between the sexes with detrimental outcomes for females. However, ants with multiply-inseminated queens have only a single time-window for sperm competition and queens are predicted to gain control over the outcome of sperm storage quickly. The seminal fluid of Acromyrmex leaf-cutting ants reduces the viability of rival sperm, but how confrontations between unrelated ejaculates affect sperm storage remains unknown. RESULTS: We investigated the effects of ejaculate admixture on sperm motility in A. echinatior and found that the proportion of motile spermatozoa, sperm swimming speed, and linearity of sperm movement increased when rival ejaculates were mixed in vitro. Major effects induced by the seminal fluid of rival males were of similar magnitude to those generated by queen reproductive tract secretions, whereas own seminal fluid induced lower sperm activation levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that ant sperm respond via a self-non-self recognition mechanism to similar or shared molecules expressed in the reproductive secretions of both sexes. Lower sperm motility in the presence of own seminal fluid indicates that enhanced motility is costly and may trade-off with sperm viability during sperm storage, consistent with studies in vertebrates. Our results imply that ant spermatozoa have evolved to adjust their energetic expenditure during insemination depending on the perceived level of sperm competition.",
  "In insect societies, chemical communication plays an important role in colony reproduction and individual social status. Many studies have indicated that cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) are the main chemical compounds encoding reproductive status. However, these studies have largely focused on queenless or monogynous species whose workers are capable of egg laying and have mainly explored the mechanisms underlying queen-worker or worker-worker reproductive conflicts. Less is known about what occurs in highly polygynous ant species with permanently sterile workers. Here, we used the Argentine ant as a model to examine the role of CHCs in communicating reproductive information in such insect societies. The Argentine ant is unicolonial, highly polygynous, and polydomous. We identified several CHCs whose presence and levels were correlated with queen age, reproductive status, and fertility. Our results also provide new insights into queen executions in the Argentine ant, a distinctive feature displayed by this species in its introduced range. Each spring, just before new sexuals appear, workers eliminate up to 90% of the mated queens in their colonies. We discovered that queens that survived execution had different CHC profiles from queens present before and during execution. More specifically, levels of some CHCs were higher in the survivors, suggesting that workers could eliminate queens based on their chemical profiles. In addition, queen CHC profiles differed based on season and species range (native vs. introduced). Overall, the results of this study provide new evidence that CHCs serve as queen signals and do more than just regulate worker reproduction.",
  "Understanding the spatial structure of populations and communities has been a dominant focus of ecological research, and spatial structure is increasingly seen as critical for understanding population dynamics. Habitat (or host) preference is a proximate mechanism that can generate aggregation or overdispersion, lending insight into the ultimate consequences of observed spatial distributions. Publilia concava is a univoltine phloem-feeding insect that forms mutualistic associations with ants, which consume honeydew and protect treehoppers from predation. Treehopper adults and nymphs are aggregated at the scale of goldenrod plant stems, and previous studies have suggested that this aggregation is an adaptive response that increases feeding performance or maximizes benefits of ant-tending. Previous studies have also shown experimentally that individual treehoppers preferentially oviposit on plants with ants present, but a complimentary hypothesis that treehoppers prefer to oviposit near conspecifics (e.g., to take advantage of density-dependent ant attraction) remains untested. We show that, as expected, the probability of treehopper oviposition increases with ant-presence and relative ant abundance. However, we also find that treehopper oviposition decreases with increasing treehopper density. Thus our results are inconsistent with the hypothesis that treehopper aggregation is a socially cooperative strategy to attract ants; we suggest that aggregation is a form of conflict and an unavoidable by-product of individual responses to ant-tending levels.",
  "Animals use a variety of sensory modalities-including visual, acoustic, and chemical-to sense their environment and interact with both conspecifics and other species. Such communication is especially critical in eusocial insects such as honey bees and ants, where cooperation is critical for survival and reproductive success. Various classes of chemoreceptors have been hypothesized to play essential roles in the origin and evolution of eusociality in ants, through their functional roles in pheromone detection that characterizes reproductive status and colony membership. To better understand the molecular mechanisms by which chemoreceptors regulate social behaviors, we investigated the roles of a critical class of chemoreceptors, the odorant receptors (ORs), from the ponerine ant Harpegnathos saltator in detecting cuticular hydrocarbon pheromones. In light of the massive OR expansion in ants (∼400 genes per species), a representative survey based on phylogenetic and transcriptomic criteria was carried out across discrete odorant receptor subfamilies. Responses to several classes of semiochemicals are described, including cuticular hydrocarbons and mandibular gland components that act as H. saltator pheromones, and a range of more traditional general odorants. When viewed through the prism of caste-specific OR enrichment and distinctive OR subfamily odorant response profiles, our findings suggest that whereas individual HsOrs appear to be narrowly tuned, there is no apparent segregation of tuning responses within any discrete HsOr subfamily. Instead, the HsOR gene family as a whole responds to a broad array of compounds, including both cuticular hydrocarbons and general odorants that are likely to mediate distinct behaviors.",
  "Social insect sex and caste ratios are well-studied targets of evolutionary conflicts, but the heritable factors affecting these traits remain unknown. To elucidate these factors, we carried out a short-term artificial selection study on female caste ratio in the ant Monomorium pharaonis. Across three generations of bidirectional selection, we observed no response for caste ratio, but sex ratios rapidly became more female-biased in the two replicate high selection lines and less female-biased in the two replicate low selection lines. We hypothesized that this rapid divergence for sex ratio was caused by changes in the frequency of infection by the heritable bacterial endosymbiont Wolbachia, because the initial breeding stock varied for Wolbachia infection, and Wolbachia is known to cause female-biased sex ratios in other insects. Consistent with this hypothesis, the proportions of Wolbachia-infected colonies in the selection lines changed rapidly, mirroring the sex ratio changes. Moreover, the estimated effect of Wolbachia on sex ratio (~13% female bias) was similar in colonies before and during artificial selection, indicating that this Wolbachia effect is likely independent of the effects of artificial selection on other heritable factors. Our study provides evidence for the first case of endosymbiont sex ratio manipulation in a social insect.",
  "Understanding why organisms senesce is a fundamental question in biology. One common explanation is that senescence results from an increase in macromolecular damage with age. The tremendous variation in lifespan between genetically identical queen and worker ants, ranging over an order of magnitude, provides a unique system to study how investment into processes of somatic maintenance and macromolecular repair influence lifespan. Here we use RNAseq to compare patterns of expression of genes involved in DNA and protein repair of age-matched queens and workers. There was no difference between queens and workers in 1-day-old individuals, but the level of expression of these genes increased with age and this up-regulation was greater in queens than in workers, resulting in significantly queen-biased expression in 2-month-old individuals in both legs and brains. Overall, these differences are consistent with the hypothesis that higher longevity is associated with increased investment into somatic repair.",
  "Gowdy & Krall provide an interesting discussion of evolutionary origins and consequences of ultrasociality. However, some of their statements concerning various features of ant and human social behavior do not adequately reflect present knowledge about the discussed issues, which include, among others, polyethism, cultural information transfer, within-group conflicts and resistance in ant societies, and reproductive division of labor in humans. Gowdy & Krall (G&K) provide an interesting discussion of evolutionary origins and consequences of ultrasociality, an advanced form of social behavior that evolved independently in both social insects and humans. Their reflections are thought-provoking, but some statements concerning various features of ant and human social behavior do not reflect adequately the present knowledge about the discussed issues.",
  "Attine ants evolved farming 55-60 My before humans. Although evolutionarily derived leafcutter ants achieved industrial-scale farming, extant species from basal attine genera continue to farm loosely domesticated fungal cultivars capable of pursuing independent reproductive interests. We used feeding experiments with the basal attine Mycocepurus smithii to test whether reproductive allocation conflicts between farmers and cultivars constrain crop yield, possibly explaining why their mutualism has remained limited in scale and productivity. Stoichiometric and geometric framework approaches showed that carbohydrate-rich substrates maximize growth of both edible hyphae and inedible mushrooms, but that modest protein provisioning can suppress mushroom formation. Worker foraging was consistent with maximizing long-term cultivar performance: ant farmers could neither increase carbohydrate provisioning without cultivars allocating the excess toward mushroom production, nor increase protein provisioning without compromising somatic cultivar growth. Our results confirm that phylogenetically basal attine farming has been very successful over evolutionary time, but that unresolved host-symbiont conflict may have precluded these wild-type symbioses from rising to ecological dominance. That status was achieved by the evolutionarily derived leafcutter ants following full domestication of a coevolving cultivar 30-35 Mya after the first attine ants committed to farming.",
  "Social dominance hierarchies are widespread, but little is known about the mechanisms that produce nonlinear structures. In addition to despotic hierarchies, where a single individual dominates, shared hierarchies exist, where multiple individuals occupy a single rank. In vertebrates, these complex dominance relationships are thought to develop from interactions that require higher cognition, but similar cases of shared dominance have been found in social insects. Combining empirical observations with a modeling approach, we show that all three hierarchy structures-linear, despotic, and shared-can emerge from different combinations of simple interactions present in social insects. Our model shows that a linear hierarchy emerges when a typical winner-loser interaction (dominance biting) is present. A despotic hierarchy emerges when a policing interaction is added that results in the complete loss of dominance status for an attacked individual (physical policing). Finally, a shared hierarchy emerges with the addition of a winner-winner interaction that results in a positive outcome for both interactors (antennal dueling). Antennal dueling is an enigmatic ant behavior that has previously lacked a functional explanation. These results show how complex social traits can emerge from simple behaviors without requiring advanced cognition.",
  "Ants provide one of the best examples of the division of labor in animal societies. While the queens reproduce, workers generally refrain from laying eggs and dedicate themselves exclusively to domestic tasks. In many species, the small diploid larvae are bipotent and can develop either into workers or queens depending mostly on environmental cues. This generates a conflicting situation between the adults that tend to rear a majority of larvae into workers and the larvae whose individual interest may be to develop into reproductive queens. We tested the social regulation of larval caste fate in the fission-performing ant Aphaenogaster senilis. We first observed interactions between resident workers and queen- and worker-destined larvae in presence/absence of the queen. The results show that workers tend to specifically eliminate queen-destined larvae when the queen is present but not when she is absent or imprisoned in a small cage allowing for volatile pheromone exchanges. In addition, we found that the presence of already developed queen-destined larvae does not inhibit the development of younger still bipotent larvae into queens. Finally, we analyzed the cuticular hydrocarbon profiles of queen- and worker-destined larvae and found no significant quantitative or qualitative difference. Interestingly, the total amount of hydrocarbons on both larval castes is extremely low, which lends credence on the chemical insignificance hypothesis of larval ants. Overall, our results suggest that workers control larval development and police larvae that would develop into queens instead of workers. Such policing behavior is similar in many aspects to what is known of worker policing among adults.",
  "Phenotypic plasticity is important in adaptation and shapes the evolution of organisms. However, we understand little about what aspects of the genome are important in facilitating plasticity. Eusocial insect societies produce plastic phenotypes from the same genome, as reproductives (queens) and nonreproductives (workers). The greatest plasticity is found in the simple eusocial insect societies in which individuals retain the ability to switch between reproductive and nonreproductive phenotypes as adults. We lack comprehensive data on the molecular basis of plastic phenotypes. Here, we sequenced genomes, microRNAs (miRNAs), and multiple transcriptomes and methylomes from individual brains in a wasp (Polistes canadensis) and an ant (Dinoponera quadriceps) that live in simple eusocial societies. In both species, we found few differences between phenotypes at the transcriptional level, with little functional specialization, and no evidence that phenotype-specific gene expression is driven by DNA methylation or miRNAs. Instead, phenotypic differentiation was defined more subtly by nonrandom transcriptional network organization, with roles in these networks for both conserved and taxon-restricted genes. The general lack of highly methylated regions or methylome patterning in both species may be an important mechanism for achieving plasticity among phenotypes during adulthood. These findings define previously unidentified hypotheses on the genomic processes that facilitate plasticity and suggest that the molecular hallmarks of social behavior are likely to differ with the level of social complexity.",
  "The central trade-off between reproduction and longevity dominates most species' life history. However, no mortality cost of reproduction is apparent in eusocial species, particularly social insects in the order Hymenoptera: one or a few individuals (typically referred to as queens) in a group specialize on reproduction and are generally longer lived than all other group members (typically referred to as workers), despite having the same genome. However, it is unclear whether this survival advantage is due to social facilitation by the group or an intrinsic, individual property. Furthermore, it is unknown whether the correlation between reproduction and longevity is due to a direct mechanistic link or an indirect consequence of the social role of the reproductives. To begin addressing these questions, we performed a comparison of queen and worker longevity in the ant Cardiocondyla obscurior under social isolation conditions. Survival of single queens and workers was compared under laboratory conditions, monitoring and controlling for brood production. Our results indicate that there is no intrinsic survival advantage of queens relative to workers unless individuals are becoming reproductively active. This interactive effect of caste and reproduction on life expectancy outside of the normal social context suggests that the positive correlation between reproduction and longevity in social insect queens is due to a direct link that can activate intrinsic survival mechanisms to ensure queen longevity.",
  "Fungus-farming ant colonies vary four to five orders of magnitude in size. They employ compounds from actinomycete bacteria and exocrine glands as antimicrobial agents. Atta colonies have millions of ants and are particularly relevant for understanding hygienic strategies as they have abandoned their ancestors' prime dependence on antibiotic-based biological control in favour of using metapleural gland (MG) chemical secretions. Atta MGs are unique in synthesizing large quantities of phenylacetic acid (PAA), a known but little investigated antimicrobial agent. We show that particularly the smallest workers greatly reduce germination rates of Escovopsis and Metarhizium spores after actively applying PAA to experimental infection targets in garden fragments and transferring the spores to the ants' infrabuccal cavities. In vitro assays further indicated that Escovopsis strains isolated from evolutionarily derived leaf-cutting ants are less sensitive to PAA than strains from phylogenetically more basal fungus-farming ants, consistent with the dynamics of an evolutionary arms race between virulence and control for Escovopsis, but not Metarhizium. Atta ants form larger colonies with more extreme caste differentiation relative to other attines, in societies characterized by an almost complete absence of reproductive conflicts. We hypothesize that these changes are associated with unique evolutionary innovations in chemical pest management that appear robust against selection pressure for resistance by specialized mycopathogens.",
  "Cooperation in biological, social, and economic groups is underpinned by public goods that are generated by group members at some personal cost. Theory predicts that public goods will be exploited by cheaters who benefit from the goods by not paying for them, thereby leading to the collapse of cooperation. This situation, described as the \"public goods dilemma\" in game theory, makes the ubiquity of cooperation a major evolutionary puzzle. Despite this generalization, the demonstration of genetic background and fitness effects of the public goods dilemma has been limited to interactions between viruses and between cells, and thus its relevance at higher levels of organismal complexity is still largely unexplored. Here we provide experimental evidence for the public goods dilemma in a social insect, the ant Pristomyrmex punctatus. In this species, all workers are involved in both asexual reproduction and cooperative tasks. Genetic cheaters infiltrate field colonies, reproducing more than the workers but shunning cooperative tasks. In laboratory experiments, cheaters outcompeted coexisting workers in both survival and reproduction, although a group composed only of cheaters failed to produce offspring. The operations of the public goods dilemma in P. punctatus showed a remarkable convergence with those in microbial societies, not only in fitness consequences but also in behavioral mechanisms. Our study reinforces the evolutionary impact of cheaters on diverse cooperative systems in the laboratory and in the field.",
  "Dispersal has consequences not only for individual fitness, but also for population dynamics, population genetics and species distribution. Social Hymenoptera show two contrasting colony reproductive strategies, dependent and independent colony foundation modes, and these are often associated to the population structures derived from inter and intra-population gene flow processes conditioned by alternative dispersal strategies. Here we employ microsatellite and mitochondrial markers to investigate the population and social genetic structure and dispersal patterns in the ant Cataglyphis emmae at both, local and regional scales. We find that C. emmae is monogynous and polyandrous. Lack of detection of any population viscosity and population structure with nuclear markers at the local scale suggests efficient dispersal, in agreement with a lack of inbreeding. Contrasting demographic differences before and during the mating seasons suggest that C. emmae workers raise sexuals in peripheric nest chambers to reduce intracolonial conflicts. The high genetic differentiation recovered from the mtDNA haplotypes, together with the significant correlation of such to geographic distance, and presence of new nuclear alleles between areas (valleys) suggest long-term historical isolation between these regions, indicative of limited dispersal at the regional scale. Our findings on the ecological, social and population structure of this species increases our understanding of the patterns and processes involved under independent colony foundation.",
  "One of the fundamental questions in biology is how cooperative and altruistic behaviors evolved. The majority of studies seeking to identify the genes regulating these behaviors have been performed in systems where behavioral and physiological differences are relatively fixed, such as in the honey bee. During colony founding in the monogyne (one queen per colony) social form of the fire ant Solenopsis invicta, newly-mated queens may start new colonies either individually (haplometrosis) or in groups (pleometrosis). However, only one queen (the \"winner\") in pleometrotic associations survives and takes the lead of the young colony while the others (the \"losers\") are executed. Thus, colony founding in fire ants provides an excellent system in which to examine the genes underpinning cooperative behavior and how the social environment shapes the expression of these genes. We developed a new whole genome microarray platform for S. invicta to characterize the gene expression patterns associated with colony founding behavior. First, we compared haplometrotic queens, pleometrotic winners and pleometrotic losers. Second, we manipulated pleometrotic couples in order to switch or maintain the social ranks of the two cofoundresses. Haplometrotic and pleometrotic queens differed in the expression of genes involved in stress response, aging, immunity, reproduction and lipid biosynthesis. Smaller sets of genes were differentially expressed between winners and losers. In the second experiment, switching social rank had a much greater impact on gene expression patterns than the initial/final rank. Expression differences for several candidate genes involved in key biological processes were confirmed using qRT-PCR. Our findings indicate that, in S. invicta, social environment plays a major role in the determination of the patterns of gene expression, while the queen's physiological state is secondary. These results highlight the powerful influence of social environment on regulation of the genomic state, physiology and ultimately, social behavior of animals.",
  "Reproductive cooperation confers benefits, but simultaneously creates conflicts among cooperators. Queens in multi-queen colonies of ants share a nest and its resources, but reproductive competition among queens often results in unequal reproduction. Two mutually non-exclusive factors may produce such inequality in reproduction: worker intervention or queen traits. Workers may intervene by favouring some queens over others, owing to either kinship or queen signals. Queens may differ in their intrinsic fecundity at the onset of oviposition or in their timing of the onset of oviposition, leading to their unequal representation in the brood. Here, we test the role of queen kin value (relatedness) to workers, timing of the onset of oviposition and signals of presence by queens in determining the maternity of offspring. We show that queens of the ant Formica fusca gained a significantly higher proportion of sexuals in the brood when ovipositing early, and that the presence of a caged queen resulted in a significant increase in both her share of sexual brood and her overall reproductive share. Moreover, the lower the kin value of the queen, the more the workers invested in their own reproduction by producing males. Our results show that both kinship and breeding phenology influence the outcome of reproductive conflicts, and the balance of direct and indirect fitness benefits in the multi-queen colonies of F. fusca.",
  "Polyphenism is the phenomenon in which alternative phenotypes are produced by a single genotype in response to environmental cues. An extreme case is found in social insects, in which reproductive queens and sterile workers that greatly differ in morphology and behavior can arise from a single genotype. Experimental evidence for maternal effects on caste determination, the differential larval development toward the queen or worker caste, was recently documented in Pogonomyrmex seed harvester ants, in which only colonies with a hibernated queen produce new queens. However, the proximate mechanisms behind these intergenerational effects have remained elusive. We used a combination of artificial hibernation, hormonal treatments, gene expression analyses, hormone measurements, and vitellogenin quantification to investigate how the combined effect of environmental cues and hormonal signaling affects the process of caste determination in Pogonomyrmex rugosus. The results show that the interplay between insulin signaling, juvenile hormone, and vitellogenin regulates maternal effects on the production of alternative phenotypes and set vitellogenin as a likely key player in the intergenerational transmission of information. This study reveals how hibernation triggers the production of new queens in Pogonomyrmex ant colonies. More generally, it provides important information on maternal effects by showing how environmental cues experienced by one generation can translate into phenotypic variation in the next generation.",
  "Queen pheromones are among the most important chemical messages regulating insect societies yet they remain largely undiscovered, hindering research into interesting proximate and ultimate questions. Identifying queen pheromones in multiple species would give new insight into the selective pressures and evolutionary constraints acting on these ubiquitous signals. Here, we present experimental and comparative evidence that 3-methylalkanes, hydrocarbons present on the queen's cuticle, are a queen pheromone throughout the ant genus Lasius. Interspecific variation in the chemical profile is consistent with 3-methylalkanes evolving more slowly than other types of hydrocarbons, perhaps due to differential selection or evolutionary constraints. We argue that the sensory ecology of the worker response imposes strong stabilizing selection on queen pheromones relative to other hydrocarbons. 3-Methylalkanes are also strongly physiologically and genetically coupled with fecundity in at least one Lasius species, which may translate into evolutionary constraints. Our results highlight how honest signalling could minimize evolutionary conflict over reproduction, promoting the evolution and maintenance of eusociality.",
  "In insect societies, worker policing controls genetic conflicts between individuals and increases colony efficiency. However, disentangling relatedness from colony-level effects is usually impossible. We studied policing in the parthenogenetic ant Cerapachys biroi, where genetic conflicts are absent due to clonality and reproduction is synchronized through stereotyped colony cycles. We show that larval cues regulate the cycles by suppressing ovarian activity and that individuals that fail to respond to these cues are policed and executed by their nestmates. These individuals are genetically identical to other colony members, confirming the absence of intracolonial genetic conflicts. At the same time, they bear distinct cuticular hydrocarbon profiles, which could serve as proximate recognition cues for policing. Policing in C. biroi keeps uncontrolled reproduction at bay and thereby maintains the colony-level phenotype. This study shows that policing can enforce adaptive colony-level phenotypes in societies with minimal or no potential genetic conflicts. In analogy to immunosurveillance on cancer cells in genetically homogeneous multicellular organisms, colony efficiency is improved via the control of individuals that do not respond properly to regulatory signals and compromise the functioning of the higher-level unit.",
  "In most ants, bees, and wasps, the workers are capable of challenging the reproductive monopoly of the queen by laying unfertilized, male eggs. An important mechanism that can resolve this conflict is policing, whereby the queen or workers prevent successful worker reproduction by selectively eating worker-laid eggs or by attacking egg-laying workers. Egg policing by workers has been shown to occur in several social wasp species, but the information used by worker wasps to discriminate between queen-laid and worker-laid eggs has never been investigated. Our aim, therefore, was to investigate if hydrocarbons might be used in egg policing by workers in the common wasp, Vespula vulgaris, where worker policing previously has been shown to be effective. Our results show that 51 different hydrocarbons are present on the surface of newly-laid eggs, and that there are pronounced quantitative differences in the hydrocarbon profiles of queen-laid and worker-laid eggs, with longer-chained alkenes and methylated alkanes (C(28)-C(31)) in particular being more abundant on the surface of queen-laid eggs. We further show that the hydrocarbon profiles on the surface of queen-laid and worker-laid eggs resemble those found on the mother queen's and workers' cuticles. Interestingly, longer-chained methylated alkanes also were more abundant on the cuticle of both mother queens and reproductive workers, suggesting that these compounds are linked to fertility, as has also been found to be the case in several ant species.",
  "Sperm competition can produce fascinating adaptations with far-reaching evolutionary consequences. Social taxa make particularly interesting models, because the outcome of sexual selection determines the genetic composition of groups, with attendant sociobiological consequences. Here, we use molecular tools to uncover some of the mechanisms and consequences of sperm competition in the leaf-cutting ant Atta colombica, a species with extreme worker size polymorphism. Competitive PCR allowed quantification of the relative numbers of sperm stored by queens from different males, and offspring genotyping revealed how sperm number translated into paternity of eggs and adult workers. We demonstrate that fertilization success is directly related to sperm numbers, that stored sperm are well-mixed and that egg paternity is constant over time. Moreover, worker size was found to have a considerable genetic component, despite expectations that genetic effects on caste fate should be minor in species with a low degree of polyandry. Our data suggest that sexual conflict over paternity is largely resolved by the lifetime commitment between mates generated by long-term sperm storage, and show that genetic variation for caste can persist in societies with comparatively high relatedness.",
  "Matricide - the killing of a mother by her own genetic offspring - is rarely observed in nature, but not unheard-of. Among animal species in which offspring remain with their mothers, the benefits gained from maternal care are so substantial1 that eliminating the mother almost never pays, making matricide vastly rarer than infanticide. Here, we report matricidal behavior in two ant species, Lasius flavus and Lasius japonicus, where workers kill resident queens (their mothers) after the latter have been sprayed with abdominal fluid by parasitic ant queens of the ants Lasius orientalis and Lasius umbratus.",
  "Coevolutionary dynamics in host-parasite systems are shaped by reciprocal selection and environmental context. When hosts and parasites share ancestry and ecological overlap, selection can act on similar traits, but population structure and geography may generate adaptive mosaics. Here, we present the first study to investigate genome-wide signatures of selection in response to a broad climatic gradient and a geographic mosaic of coevolution between a social parasite and its host. We examined these processes in the dulotic ant Temnothorax americanus and its congeneric host Temnothorax longispinosus using population genomics, genome-wide association analyses, and transcriptomics. Host populations showed very weak and parasites stronger population structure, enabling geographic mosaic dynamics. Genomic responses to parasite prevalence were divergent: Hosts showed signatures of selection on immune genes, whereas regulatory genes associated with raiding were under selection in parasites. Both species displayed convergent signatures of climate adaptation, including loci related to desiccation resistance, stress response, and parasite prevalence, with signals in communication and recognition genes involved in hydrocarbon biosynthesis, chemosensory perception, circadian rhythms, and venom production. Transcriptome analyses revealed contrasting patterns, with host gene expression linked to parasite prevalence and parasite expression more strongly shaped by climate. Together, our results reveal a genomic mosaic of coadaptation, in which population structure, asymmetric selection, and ecological variation interact to generate divergent yet interconnected evolutionary trajectories. Our findings highlight communication and recognition as recurrent arenas of antagonistic coevolution, underscore climate as a pervasive selective force, and establish a framework for investigating molecular coevolution in social parasite systems.",
  "Among the very rarest of Nearctic ants are three species of inquiline social parasites belonging to the genus Monomorium, namely Monomoriuminquilinum DuBois, Monomoriumpergandei (Emery), and Monomoriumtalbotae DuBois. All three species are known only from the type collections. Here, we describe Monomoriumdine Cover & Rabeling, sp. nov., from the Navajo Nation in New Mexico, USA, a new species closely similar to the three known social parasites. Like them, M.dine appears to be a workerless inquiline that exploits a free-living Monomorium host. We also provide keys to the queens of the Nearctic Monomorium inquilines, provide the first images of these species, report new collections for Monomoriumtalbotae DuBois, discuss host-parasite associations, and summarize what is presently known about these mysterious social parasites.",
  "Multiple pathogens have been identified in red imported fire ants (Solenopsis invicta Buren) in native and introduced ranges, but pathogens infecting black (Solenopsis richteri Forel) or S. invicta × S. richteri hybrids are less studied. Pathogens like Kneallhazia solenopsae (Knell, Allen & Hazard) and Solenopsis invicta virus 3 (SINV-3) negatively impact colony growth and survival and offer augmentative biocontrol potential. The objective of this work was to determine the geography and phenology of K. solenopsae, SINV-1, SINV-2, and SINV-3 pathogens within the Tennessee hybrid-dominated populations. During 2015 to 2016, 62 fire ant-infested counties were gridded (12.1-by-12.1 km), and one colony sampled per grid in warm (July to October) and cool (January to April) periods. Fire ant species were determined by cuticular hydrocarbon and venom alkaloid analysis. Samples were evaluated for pathogens, parasitoids, and social form by molecular analysis. Ant frequencies were hybrid (74.1%), black (25.3%), and red (0.6%). Infection rates were low (9.5% and 1.3% in warm and cool periods, respectively). Parasite prevalence was 4.2% (SINV-1), 1.3% (K. solenopsae), 0.9% (SINV-3), 0.1% (SINV-2), and 0.1% (Pseudacteon). Hybrid colony infection rates were higher (82.2%) than black and red (17.8%) colonies. Polygyne colonies were infrequent (n = 6 of 99) but were more frequently infected (66.7%) than monogyne (11.8%). The most widely distributed pathogen was SINV-1. Higher elevations may negatively influence SINV-1 range expansion. Higher hybridity values (ie more red-like) increased viral infection likelihood, but not Kneallhazia infection. Parasite prevalence was low in Tennessee hybrid-dominated monogyne populations, which may limit their impact on fire ant populations.",
  "Polyrhachis lamellidens is a temporary socially parasitic ant. The newly mated P. lamellidens queen takes over a colony of several Camponotus ant species and uses the labour of the host workers in the early stages of social parasitism. To facilitate genomic resources for these species, we assembled and annotated the chromosomal genome of P. lamellidens using the 10× Genomics linked-read and Hi-C sequencing, and the draft genome of its host, Camponotus japonicus, using long-read sequencing with the Revio system. The P. lamellidens chromosomal genome assembly is 214.1 Mb, 95.5% BUSCO completeness, and contains 13,703 protein-coding genes. The C. japonicus draft genome assembly is 314.2 Mb, 99.0% BUSCO completeness, and contains 11,207 protein-coding genes. Genome-wide phylogeny and synteny analysis confirmed the phylogenetic position of P. lamellidens and C. japonicus, and a high level of synteny with the genome of both ant species. In addition, P. lamellidens possesses nearly identical chemosensory proteins to its host, C. japonicus, and these genes tended to exhibit higher expression levels in the newly mated queen. The genome assemblies of P. lamellidens and its host C. japonicus provide a valuable resource for the molecular biological and bioinformatic basis for studying the strategy of social parasitism in ants.",
  "We surveyed 559 colonies of the fire ant Solenopsis invicta in 15 sites in its native range in Argentina for the microsporidian parasite Kneallhazia solenopsae, a natural enemy of this ant. The microsporidium was detected in 20 out of 508 monogyne and nine out of 51 polygyne colonies corresponding to mean infection prevalences of 3.31% and 13.68%, respectively. In the USA, previous studies have shown that K. solenopsae prevalence in the polygyne social form is variable, and as high as 100% in certain sites, whereas infections in the monogyne social form in the USA are rare. In this study, we found that the K. solenopsae genetic variant in the USA is genetically different from the variants identified in the native range, supporting the idea that the USA variant may only infect polygyne colonies.",
  "Social parasites employ diverse strategies to deceive and infiltrate their hosts in order to benefit from stable resources. Although escape behaviours are considered an important part of these multipronged strategies, little is known about the repertoire of potential escape behaviours and how they facilitate integration into the host colony. Here, we investigated the escape strategies of the parasitic ant cricket Myrmecophilus tetramorii Ichikawa (Orthoptera: Myrmecophilidae) toward its host and non-host ant workers. We identified two escape strategies with distinct trajectory characteristics by clustering analysis; distancing (defined by high-speed straight movement away from ants for emergency avoidance) and dodging (circular escape movement to get behind ants under low-threat conditions). Interestingly, dodging is dominantly elicited over distancing for host species. Furthermore, our simulations proposed that dodging contributes to efficient foraging while avoiding ants. These results demonstrate that switching to a host-adapted escape strategy facilitates integration of this parasitic cricket into ant nests.",
  "The winter ant, Prenolepis imparis, is one of the most common, widespread, and conspicuous ant species in North America. P. imparis is well adapted to cold climates, and consequently, is often noted as the only active ant species during colder months. This specialized life history makes P. imparis a useful model organism for exploring thermal physiology and understanding the potential impacts of a warming climate on insects. Phylogeographic studies have revealed deeply divergent lineages across North America, as well as a single collection of an apparent social parasite in California. In light of its distinctive cold adaptation and recently discovered geographic diversity, a better understanding of the underlying genetic patterns of the winter ant is valuable to future conservation efforts for this species. Here, we present a high-quality genome assembly of P. imparis from Santa Clara County, California. This genome assembly consists of 787 scaffolds spanning 327.3 Mb, with contig N50 of 901.9 kb, scaffold N50 of 18.7 Mb, and BUSCO completeness of 96.5%. This genome assembly provides an essential foundation for future studies of the winter ant and will be particularly useful for understanding the genetic basis of thermal adaptation, cold resistance, chemical ecology, and the resilience of organisms in response to a changing climate.",
  "The ant genus Temnothorax is one of the most diverse in the Palearctic region, comprising several species with different life histories and uncertain taxonomic backgrounds. Socially parasitic Temnothorax ant species were typically described decades ago, primarily based on traditional morphological traits. In some aspects, these species have come back into the spotlight in recent years, necessitating a comprehensive taxonomic revision of the species of the genus. In this paper, we present a quantitative morphology-based taxonomic revision of the Temnothorax corsicus species group (formerly called Myrmoxenus genus) based on the analysis of 20 continuous morphometric traits collected from 394 worker and 19 traits from 473 gyne individuals belonging to 240 samples. Based on morphometric analyses, we propose junior synonymy for Temnothorax tamarae (Arnol'di, 1968) under T. ravouxi (André, 1896), and T. microcellatus (Soudek, 1925) is revived and is considered a senior synonym of T. menozzii (Finzi, 1924). Detailed descriptions, measurements, distribution, and host usage of all ten species are given. Dichotomous keys to workers, known gynes, and photographs of all species are presented.",
  "The study of social parasitism faces numerous challenges arising from the intricate and intranidal host-parasite interactions and the rarity of parasites compared to their free-living counterparts. As a result, our understanding of the ecology and evolution of most social parasites remains limited. Using whole-genome and reduced-representation sequence data, we conducted a study to fill knowledge gaps on host use, colony social structure, and population genetics of the facultative dulotic ant Formica aserva Forel. Our study reveals the remarkable ability of F. aserva to exploit at least 20 different host species across its wide geographic distribution. In some cases, one social parasite colony exploits multiple hosts simultaneously, suggesting a high degree of generalization even at a local spatial scale. Approximately 80% of the colonies were monogyne (with a single queen), with many exhibiting higher rates of polyandry compared to most Formica ants. Although we identified a supergene on chromosome 3, its association with colony structure remains uncertain due to the rarity of polygyny in our sample. Population genetic analyses reveal substantial geographic population structure, with the greatest divergence between California populations and those from the rest of the range. Mitochondrial population structure differs from structure inferred from the nuclear genome on a broad geographic scale, suggesting a possible role of adaptive introgression or genetic drift. This study provides valuable insights into the ecology and evolution of F. aserva, underscoring the need for further research to decipher the complexities of host interactions and the genetic mechanisms that regulate social structure.",
  "The fitness effects of overt parasites, and host resistance to them, are well documented. Most symbionts, however, are more covert and their interactions with their hosts are less well understood. Wolbachia, an intracellular symbiont of insects, is particularly interesting because it is thought to be unaffected by the host immune response and to have fitness effects mostly focussed on sex ratio manipulation. Here, we use quantitative PCR to investigate whether host genotype affects Wolbachia infection density in the leaf-cutting ant Acromyrmex echinatior, and whether Wolbachia infection density may affect host morphology or caste determination. We found significant differences between host colonies in the density of Wolbachia infections, and also smaller intracolonial differences in infection density between host patrilines. However, the density of Wolbachia infections did not appear to affect the morphology of adult queens or likelihood of ants developing as queens. The results suggest that both host genotype and environment influence the host-Wolbachia relationship, but that Wolbachia infections carry little or no physiological effect on the development of larvae in this system.",
  "A co-evolutionary arms race ensues when parasites exhibit exploitative behaviour, which prompts adaptations in their hosts, in turn triggering counter-adaptations by the parasites. To unravel the genomic basis of this coevolution from the host's perspective, we collected ants of the host species Temnothorax longispinosus, parasitized by the social parasite Temnothorax americanus, from 10 populations in the northeastern United States exhibiting varying levels of parasite prevalence and living under different climatic conditions. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with both prevalence and climate. Our investigation highlighted a multitude of candidate SNPs associated with parasite prevalence, particularly in genes responsible for sensory perception of smell including odorant receptor genes. We further focused on population-specific compositions of cuticular hydrocarbons, a complex trait important for signalling, communication and protection against desiccation. The relative abundances of n-alkanes were correlated with climate, while there was only a trend between parasite prevalence and the relative abundances of known recognition cues. Furthermore, we identified candidate genes likely involved in the synthesis and recognition of specific hydrocarbons. In addition, we analysed the population-level gene expression in the antennae, the primary organ for odorant reception, and established a strong correlation with parasite prevalence. Our comprehensive study highlights the intricate genomic patterns forged by the interplay of diverse selection factors and how these are manifested in the expression of various phenotypes.",
  "Four new inquiline social parasites are described in the dolichoderine ant genus Tapinoma from the Nearctic region, and keys are provided for queens and males of the Nearctic Tapinoma species. The new social parasite species represent the first inquiline species in the genus Tapinoma and the first confirmed inquilines known from the ant subfamily Dolichoderinae. The four new species appear to be workerless inquilines that exploit a single host, Tapinomasessile (Say), and they represent at least two distinct life history syndromes. Tapinomaincognitum Cover & Rabeling, sp. nov. is highly derived morphologically and is a host-queen-tolerant inquiline. In contrast, T.inflatiscapus Cover & Rabeling, sp. nov. shows a lesser degree of morphological modification and appears to be a host-queen-intolerant social parasite. The life history of T.pulchellum Cover & Rabeling, sp. nov. is presently unknown, but its close similarity to T.incognitum suggests that it is also a host-queen-tolerant inquiline. The life history of T.shattucki Cover & Rabeling, sp. nov. is still uncertain. Our findings provide novel insights into the complex biology of ant inquiline life history syndromes.",
  "In animals, parasitic infections impose significant fitness costs.1,2,3,4,5,6 Infected animals can alter their feeding behavior to resist infection,7,8,9,10,11,12 but parasites can manipulate animal foraging behavior to their own benefits.13,14,15,16 How nutrition influences host-parasite interactions is not well understood, as studies have mainly focused on the host and less on the parasite.9,12,17,18,19,20,21,22,23 We used the nutritional geometry framework24 to investigate the role of amino acids (AA) and carbohydrates (C) in a host-parasite system: the Argentine ant, Linepithema humile, and the entomopathogenic fungus, Metarhizium brunneum. First, using 18 diets varying in AA:C composition, we established that the fungus performed best on the high-amino-acid diet 1:4. Second, we found that the fungus reached this optimal diet when given various diet pairings, revealing its ability to cope with nutritional challenges. Third, we showed that the optimal fungal diet reduced the lifespan of healthy ants when compared with a high-carbohydrate diet but had no effect on infected ants. Fourth, we revealed that infected ant colonies, given a choice between the optimal fungal diet and a high-carbohydrate diet, chose the optimal fungal diet, whereas healthy colonies avoided it. Lastly, by disentangling fungal infection from host immune response, we demonstrated that infected ants foraged on the optimal fungal diet in response to immune activation and not as a result of parasite manipulation. Therefore, we revealed that infected ant colonies chose a diet that is costly for survival in the long term but beneficial in the short term-a form of collective self-medication.",
  "Parasitism is ubiquitous across the tree of life, and parasites comprise approximately half of all animal species. Social insect colonies attract many pathogens, endo- and ectoparasites, and are exploited by social parasites, which usurp the social environment of their hosts for survival and reproduction. Exploitation by parasites and pathogens versus social parasites may cause similar behavioural and morphological modifications of the host. Ants possess two overlapping syndromes: the endo- and social parasite syndromes. We rediscovered two populations of the putative social parasite Manica parasitica in the Sierra Nevada, and tested the hypothesis that M. parasitica is an independently evolving social parasite. We evaluated traits used to discriminate M. parasitica from its host Manica bradleyi, and examined the morphology of M. parasitica in the context of ant parasitic syndromes. We find that M. parasitica is not a social parasite. Instead, M. parasitica represents cestode-infected M. bradleyi. We propose that M. parasitica should be regarded as a junior synonym of M. bradleyi. Our results emphasize that an integrative approach is essential for unravelling the complex life histories of social insects and their symbionts.",
  "Social insects, such as ants, are preferred host organisms of pathogens and parasites because colonies are densely populated, and the number of potential hosts is high in the same place and time. Within a colony, individuals are exposed differentially to risks according to their function and age. Thus, older individuals forage and are therefore the most exposed to infection, predation, or physical stress, while young workers mostly stay inside the sheltered nest being less exposed. Immune investment is considered to be dependent on an individual's age and pathogen pressure. Long-term exposure to a parasite could affect the immune activity of individuals in an intriguing way that interferes with the age-dependent decline in immunocompetence. However, there are only few cases in which such interferences can be studied. The myrmecopathogenic fungus Rickia wasmannii, which infects entire colonies without killing the workers, is a suitable candidate for such studies. We investigated the general immunocompetence of Myrmica scabrinodis ant workers associated with non-lethal fungal infection by measuring the levels of active phenoloxidase (PO) and total PO (PPO) (reflecting the amount of both active and inactive forms of the enzyme) in two age classes. The level of PO proved to be higher in infected workers than in uninfected ones, while the level of PPO increased with age but was not affected by infection. Overall, these results indicate that a long-term infection could go hand in hand with increased immune activity of ant workers, conferring them higher level of protection.",
  "Antagonistic selection has long been considered a major driver of the formation and expansion of sex chromosomes. For example, sexually antagonistic variation on an autosome can select for suppressed recombination between that autosome and the sex chromosome, leading to a neo-sex chromosome. Autosomal supergenes, chromosomal regions containing tightly linked variants affecting the same complex trait, share similarities with sex chromosomes, raising the possibility that sex chromosome evolution models can explain the evolution of genome structure and recombination in other contexts. We tested this premise in a Formica ant species, wherein we identified four supergene haplotypes on chromosome 3 underlying colony social organization and sex ratio. We discovered a novel rearranged supergene variant (9r) on chromosome 9 underlying queen miniaturization. The 9r is in strong linkage disequilibrium with one chromosome 3 haplotype (P2) found in multi-queen (polygyne) colonies. We suggest that queen miniaturization is strongly disfavored in the single-queen (monogyne) background and is thus socially antagonistic. As such, divergent selection experienced by ants living in alternative social \"environments\" (monogyne and polygyne) may have contributed to the emergence of a genetic polymorphism on chromosome 9 and associated queen-size dimorphism. Consequently, an ancestral polygyne-associated haplotype may have expanded to include the polymorphism on chromosome 9, resulting in a larger region of suppressed recombination spanning two chromosomes. This process is analogous to the formation of neo-sex chromosomes and consistent with models of expanding regions of suppressed recombination. We propose that miniaturized queens, 16%-20% smaller than queens without 9r, could be incipient intraspecific social parasites.",
  "Insect social parasites are characterized by exploiting the hosts' social behaviour. Why exactly hosts direct their caring behaviour towards these parasites and their offspring remains largely unstudied. One hypothesis is that hosts do not perceive their social environment as altered and accept the parasitic colony as their own. We used the ant Leptothorax acervorum, host of the dulotic, obligate social parasite Harpagoxenus sublaevis, to shed light on molecular mechanisms underlying behavioural exploitation by contrasting tissue-specific transcriptomes in young host workers. Host pupae were experimentally (re-)introduced into fragments of their original, another conspecific, heterospecific or parasitic colony. Brain and antennal mRNA was extracted and sequenced from adult ants after they had lived in the experimental colony for at least 50 days after eclosion. The resulting transcriptomes of L. acervorum revealed that ants were indeed affected by their social environment. Host brain transcriptomes were altered by the presence of social parasites, suggesting that the parasitic environment influences brain activity, which may be linked to behavioural changes. Transcriptional activity in the antennae changed most with the presence of unrelated individuals, regardless of whether they were conspecifics or parasites. This suggests early priming of odour perception, which was further supported by sensory perception of odour as an enriched function of differentially expressed genes. Furthermore, gene expression in the antennae, but not in the brain corresponded to ant worker behaviour before sampling. Our study demonstrated that the exploitation of social behaviours by brood parasites correlates with transcriptomic alterations in the central and peripheral nervous systems.",
  "Studying the historical biogeography and life history transitions from eusocial colony life to social parasitism contributes to our understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms generating biodiversity in eusocial insects. The ants in the genus Myrmecia are a well-suited system for testing evolutionary hypotheses about how their species diversity was assembled through time because the genus is endemic to Australia with the single exception of the species M. apicalis inhabiting the Pacific Island of New Caledonia, and because at least one social parasite species exists in the genus. However, the evolutionary mechanisms underlying the disjunct biogeographic distribution of M. apicalis and the life history transition(s) to social parasitism remain unexplored. To study the biogeographic origin of the isolated, oceanic species M. apicalis and to reveal the origin and evolution of social parasitism in the genus, we reconstructed a comprehensive phylogeny of the ant subfamily Myrmeciinae. We utilized Ultra Conserved Elements (UCEs) as molecular markers to generate a molecular genetic dataset consisting of 2,287 loci per taxon on average for 66 out of the 93 known Myrmecia species as well as for the sister lineage Nothomyrmecia macrops and selected outgroups. Our time-calibrated phylogeny inferred that: (i) stem Myrmeciinae originated during the Paleocene ∼ 58 Ma ago; (ii) the current disjunct biogeographic distribution of M. apicalis was driven by long-distance dispersal from Australia to New Caledonia during the Miocene ∼ 14 Ma ago; (iii) the single social parasite species, M. inquilina, evolved directly from one of the two known host species, M. nigriceps, in sympatry via the intraspecific route of social parasite evolution; and (iv) 5 of the 9 previously established taxonomic species groups are non-monophyletic. We suggest minor changes to reconcile the molecular phylogenetic results with the taxonomic classification. Our study enhances our understanding of the evolution and biogeography of Australian bulldog ants, contributes to our knowledge about the evolution of social parasitism in ants, and provides a solid phylogenetic foundation for future inquiries into the biology, taxonomy, and classification of Myrmeciinae.",
  "The sudden appearance of small winged queens within a lineage of asexually reproducing ant workers reveals that such social parasites can appear abruptly. The parasitic queens differ in a large genomic region, suggesting that a supergene instantly equipped the social parasite with a suite of co-adapted traits.",
  "Many parasites interfere with the behaviour of their hosts. In social animals, such as ants, parasitic interference can cause changes on the level of the individual and also on the level of the society. The ant-parasitic fungus Rickia wasmannii influences the behaviour of Myrmica ants by expanding the host's nestmate recognition template, thereby increasing the chance of the colony accepting infected non-nestmates. Infected ants consistently show an increase of the alkane tricosane (n-C23) in their cuticular hydrocarbon profiles. Although experimental application of single compounds often elicits aggression towards manipulated ants, we hypothesized that the increase of n-C23 might underlie the facilitated acceptance of infected non-nestmates. To test this, we mimicked fungal infection in M. scabrinodis by applying synthetic n-C23 to fresh ant corpses and observed the reaction of infected and uninfected workers to control and manipulated corpses. Infected ants appeared to be more peaceful towards infected but not uninfected non-nestmates. Adding n-C23 to uninfected corpses resulted in reduced aggression in uninfected ants. This supports the hypothesis that n-C23 acts as a 'pacifying' signal. Our study indicates that parasitic interference with the nestmate discrimination of host ants might eventually change colony structure by increasing genetic heterogeneity in infected colonies.",
  "BACKGROUND: Many faunistic studies on the myrmecofauna of Bulgaria have been carried out and about 180 ant species (Hymenoptera, Formicidae) from 43 genera and six subfamilies have been discovered as a result. Although the Bulgarian ant fauna is considered to be relatively well studied, the finding of unrecorded species continues, especially amongst the rare social parasites and the species with a more southern distribution in the Balkans. NEW INFORMATION: The current study presents data on 11 ant species recorded for the first time in Bulgaria (Messorhellenius Agosti & Collingwood, 1987, M.mcarthuri Steiner et al., 2018, Crematogasterionia Forel, 1911, Monomoriummonomorium Bolton, 1987, Temnothoraxaeolius (Forel, 1911), T.cf.exilis(formdarii Forel, 1911), T.finzii (Menozzi, 1925), T.rogeri Emery, 1869, Tetramoriumcf.punicum, Plagiolepisxene Stärcke, 1936 and Lasiusreginae Faber, 1967), as well as new locality data on 15 rarely found species. Some of the species, such as Hypoponeraeduardi (Forel, 1894), Strumigenysargiola (Emery, 1869), Temnothoraxgraecus (Forel, 1911), Tetramoriumdiomedeum Emery, 1908, Camponotusionius Emery, 1920 and C.tergestinus Müller, 1921, have been known so far only from a single locality in Bulgaria.The dataset of all records presented in this work was published separately through Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF, https://doi.org/10.15468/mngbzp).",
  "Multiple ant lineages have evolved a bizarre system called social hybridogenesis, involving multiple co-occurring genetic lineages, in which mating between lineages produces workers but mating within a lineage produces daughter queens. A new study reveals that this system evolved multiple times within harvester ants, each time from interspecific hybridization. A third finding, that the system likely evolves in small or isolated populations, could be explained either by exploitation of heterospecific males for their sperm, or simply by failure to avoid interspecific mating.",
  "Social parasites exploit the brood care behavior of their hosts to raise their own offspring. Social parasites are common among eusocial Hymenoptera and exhibit a wide range of distinct life history traits in ants, bees, and wasps. In ants, obligate inquiline social parasites are workerless (or nearly-so) species that engage in lifelong interactions with their hosts, taking advantage of the existing host worker forces to reproduce and exploit host colonies' resources. Inquiline social parasites are phylogenetically diverse with approximately 100 known species that evolved at least 40 times independently in ants. Importantly, ant inquilines tend to be closely related to their hosts, an observation referred to as 'Emery's Rule'. Polygyny, the presence of multiple egg-laying queens, was repeatedly suggested to be associated with the origin of inquiline social parasitism, either by providing the opportunity for reproductive cheating, thereby facilitating the origin of social parasite species, and/or by making polygynous species more vulnerable to social parasitism via the acceptance of additional egg-laying queens in their colonies. Although the association between host polygyny and the evolution of social parasitism has been repeatedly discussed in the literature, it has not been statistically tested in a phylogenetic framework across the ants. Here, we conduct a meta-analysis of ant social structure and social parasitism, testing for an association between polygyny and inquiline social parasitism with a phylogenetic correction for independent evolutionary events. We find an imperfect but significant over-representation of polygynous species among hosts of inquiline social parasites, suggesting that while polygyny is not required for the maintenance of inquiline social parasitism, it (or factors associated with it) may favor the origin of socially parasitic behavior. Our results are consistent with an intra-specific origin model for the evolution of inquiline social parasites by sympatric speciation but cannot exclude the alternative, inter-specific allopatric speciation model. The diversity of social parasite behaviors and host colony structures further supports the notion that inquiline social parasites evolved in parallel across unrelated ant genera in the formicoid clade via independent evolutionary pathways.",
  "BACKGROUND: Parasites cause predictable alternative phenotypes of host individuals. Investigating these parasitogenic phenotypes may be essential in cases where parasitism is common or taxa is described based on a parasitized individual. Ignoring them could lead to erroneous conclusions in biodiversity-focused research, taxonomy, evolution, and ecology. However, to date, integrating alternative phenotypes into a set of wild-type individuals in morphometric analysis poses extraordinary challenges to experts. This paper presents an approach for reconstructing the putative healthy morphology of parasitized ants using algorithmic processing. Our concept enables the integration of alternative parasitogenic phenotypes in morphometric analyses. METHODS: We tested the applicability of our strategy in a large pool of Cestoda-infected and healthy individuals of three Temnothorax ant species (T. nylanderi, T. sordidulus, and T. unifasciatus). We assessed the stability and convergence of morphological changes caused by parasitism across species. We used an artificial neural network-based multiclass classifier model to predict species based on morphological trait values and the presence of parasite infection. RESULTS: Infection causes predictable morphological changes in each species, although these changes proved to be species-specific. Therefore, integrating alternative parasitogenic phenotypes in morphometric analyses can be achieved at the species level, and a prior species hypothesis is required. CONCLUSION: Despite the above limitation, the concept is appropriate. Beyond parasitogenic phenotypes, our approach can also integrate morphometric data of an array of alternative phenotypes (subcastes in social insects, alternative morphs in polyphenic species, and alternative sexes in sexually dimorphic species) whose integrability had not been resolved before.",
  "Ant nest beetles (Carabidae, Paussinae, Paussini; Paussus) are renowned myrmecophiles, mostly known for their bizarre and diverse antennal shape. While little is known about their development, behavior and host range, we do know they spend most of their lives inside ant nests, feeding upon the hemolymph of ant brood and teneral workers. Recent findings suggest these beetles use a surprisingly complex strategy for interacting and deceiving ants. They have managed to break into multiple communication channels that ants use to recognize and communicate with one another in order to deceive the ants and profit from the rich resources of the nest. Mounting evidence from structural, chemical, acoustic, and behavioral studies support the hypothesis that Paussus is among the most highly integrated parasite of social insects known to date.",
  "The rise of ants over the past ~100 million years reshaped the biosphere, presenting ecological challenges for many organisms, but also opportunities. No insect group has been so adept at exploiting niches inside ant colonies as the rove beetles (Staphylinidae) - a global clade of>64,000 predominantly free-living predators from which numerous socially parasitic 'myrmecophile' lineages have emerged. Myrmecophilous staphylinids are specialized for colony life through changes in behavior, chemistry, anatomy, and life history that are often strikingly convergent, and hence potentially adaptive for this symbiotic way of life. Here, we examine how the interplay between ecological pressures and molecular, cellular, and neurobiological mechanisms shape the evolutionary trajectories of symbiotic lineages in this ancient, convergent system.",
  "Polyrhachis lamellidens is a temporary social parasitic species. When a newly mated queen encounters a host worker, it opens its jaws and then mounts and rubs the body of the host worker, called rubbing behaviour. This behaviour is different from aggressive behaviour and is considered to be a preparatory action before invasion of the host colony. However, it is unclear what cues trigger rubbing behaviour. Therefore, in this study, we used glass beads that imitated the insect body surfaces and searched for triggers. Although P. lamellidens did not respond to the cuticular compounds only, cuticular compounds and chitin coatings on glass beads elicited responses that were similar to those towards live samples. The rubbing behaviour of P. lamellidens was elicited in response to a cuticle-like surface that mimicked a procuticle by combining the compounds with chitin. These results suggest that host recognition and nest-mate recognition are supported by different mechanisms. This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.",
  "A eusocial colony typically consists of two main castes: queens that reproduce and sterile workers that help them. This division of labor, however, is vulnerable to genetic elements that favor the development of their carriers into queens. Several factors, such as intracolonial relatedness, can modulate the spread of such caste-biasing genotypes. Here we investigate the effects of a notable yet understudied ecological setting: where larvae produced by hybridization develop into sterile workers. Using mathematical modeling, we show that the coevolution of hybridization with caste determination readily triggers an evolutionary arms race between nonhybrid larvae that increasingly develop into queens, and queens that increasingly hybridize to produce workers. Even where hybridization reduces worker function and colony fitness, this race can lead to the loss of developmental plasticity and to genetically hard-wired caste determination. Overall, our results may help understand the repeated evolution toward remarkable reproductive systems (e.g., social hybridogenesis) observed in several ant species.",
  "Exploitation of organisms by multiple parasite species is common in nature, but interactions among parasites have rarely been studied. Myrmica ants are rich in parasites. Among others, the ectoparasitic Rickia wasmannii fungus and the parasitic caterpillars of myrmecophilous Phengaris butterflies often infect the same Myrmica colonies. In this study, we examined the effects of R. wasmannii on the adoption, long-term development, and survival of P. alcon. In laboratory conditions, caterpillars introduced into nests of Myrmica scabrinodis uninfected with R. wasmannii survived significantly longer compared to caterpillars introduced into infected nests. In the field, joint infection was less common than expected if both parasites exploited M. scabrinodis colonies independently. Pre-pupal caterpillars of P. alcon were somewhat larger in nests infected with R. wasmannii than those found in uninfected nests. Based on these results it seems that R. wasmannii infection of M. scabrinodis affects the survival and development of P. alcon caterpillars, suggesting competition between these two ant parasites.",
  "Myrmecophilous butterflies can establish complex symbiotic relationships with ants. A caterpillar wandering among the brood of the aggressive ponerine ant Neoponera villosa was found inside the core of a nest built in the myrmecophytic bromeliad Aechmea bracteata. This is the first caterpillar found living inside a ponerine ant nest. Its DNA barcode was sequenced, and an integrative approach was used to identify it as Pseudonymphidia agave, a poorly known member of the subtribe Pachythonina in the riodinid tribe Nymphidiini. The cuticle of the tank-like caterpillar lacks projections or tubercles and is covered dorsally by specialized flat setae that form an armor of small plates. Ant-organs potentially related to caterpillar-ant signaling, such as perforated cupola organs and tentacle nectary organs, are present. These morphological traits, together with evidence of social integration (direct contact with host brood, protective morphology, slow movement, no host aggressiveness), suggest that P. agave is a symbiotic, social parasite of N. villosa, preying on its host brood. However, several knowledge gaps remain, including oviposition site, dependence on bromeliad association, steps to colony integration, and larval diet through development. Carnivory has been reported in all known members of the subtribe Pachythonina (caterpillars prey on honeydew-producing hemipterans) suggesting a shift to myrmecophagy inside the ant nests as a possible evolutionary transition.",
  "The evolution of an obligate parasitic lifestyle often leads to the reduction of morphological and physiological traits, which may be accompanied by loss of genes and functions. Slave-making ants are social parasites that exploit the work force of closely related ant species for social behaviors such as brood care and foraging. Recent divergence between these social parasites and their hosts enables comparative studies of gene family evolution. We sequenced the genomes of eight ant species, representing three independent origins of ant slavery. During the evolution of eusociality, chemoreceptor genes multiplied due to the importance of chemical communication in insect societies. We investigated the evolutionary fate of these chemoreceptors and found that slave-making ant genomes harbored only half as many gustatory receptors as their hosts', potentially mirroring the outsourcing of foraging tasks to host workers. In addition, parasites had fewer odorant receptors and their loss shows striking patterns of convergence across independent origins of parasitism, in particular in orthologs often implicated in sociality like the 9-exon odorant receptors. These convergent losses represent a rare case of convergent molecular evolution at the level of individual genes. Thus, evolution can operate in a way that is both repeatable and reversible when independent ant lineages lose important social traits during the transition to a parasitic lifestyle.",
  "In between Earth's poles, ants exert impacts on other biota that are unmatched by most animal clades. Through their interactions with animals, plants, fungi and microbes, ants have cultivated - or succumbed to - relationships ranging from metabolic mutualisms to exploitation by social parasites. The diversity of these relationships implies that ants are keystone taxa in many habitats, directly or indirectly supporting a menagerie of other species. Yet, beyond these interactions is a less obvious but arguably as significant impact: through their collective ecological pressure, ants have imposed survivorship bias on the species that we observe inhabiting terrestrial environments. If life on land has passed through an ant-shaped selective filter, it is imperative we understand how these insects have sculpted ecological communities and are enmeshed within them. Here, we describe how ants have shaped biodiversity, and the often-devastating consequences of humanity's impact on these social insects.",
  "Symbiotic relationships are widespread in nature, but the mechanisms maintaining these relationships remain to be elucidated because symbiosis incurs a maintenance cost to each participant, which lowers its reproductive rate. In host-parasite relationships, parasites are known to manipulate the host's behavior selfishly, and there is an arms race between them. Selfish manipulations also occur in symbiosis, but the effects of selfish manipulations on symbiosis are not fully understood. Here, we show that an ant-associated aphid manipulates attending ants to receive stronger protection. Aphid honeydew regurgitated by ants contains dopamine (DA). The ants showed low aggressiveness before contact with the aphids, but it rose after contact. Administration of DA to the ants increased ant aggressiveness as the concentration increased, while an antagonist of DA inhibited this effect. The other 3 amines showed no effect on aggressiveness. A previous study showed that attending ants selfishly manipulate aphids by increasing the reproductive rate of green morph to obtain high-quality honeydew. These results suggest that mutual selfish manipulation benefits both participants and is likely to strengthen symbiosis. The selfishness of each participant may contribute to sustaining this symbiosis because their selfishness increases their long-term fitness.",
  "Studying the behavioral and life history transitions from a cooperative, eusocial life history to exploitative social parasitism allows for deciphering the conditions under which changes in behavior and social organization lead to diversification. The Holarctic ant genus Formica is ideally suited for studying the evolution of social parasitism because half of its 172 species are confirmed or suspected social parasites, which includes all three major classes of social parasitism known in ants. However, the life history transitions associated with the evolution of social parasitism in this genus are largely unexplored. To test competing hypotheses regarding the origins and evolution of social parasitism, we reconstructed a global phylogeny of Formica ants. The genus originated in the Old World ∼30 Ma ago and dispersed multiple times to the New World and back. Within Formica, obligate dependent colony-founding behavior arose once from a facultatively polygynous common ancestor practicing independent and facultative dependent colony foundation. Temporary social parasitism likely preceded or arose concurrently with obligate dependent colony founding, and dulotic social parasitism evolved once within the obligate dependent colony-founding clade. Permanent social parasitism evolved twice from temporary social parasitic ancestors that rarely practiced colony budding, demonstrating that obligate social parasitism can originate from a facultative parasitic background in socially polymorphic organisms. In contrast to permanently socially parasitic ants in other genera, the high parasite diversity in Formica likely originated via allopatric speciation, highlighting the diversity of convergent evolutionary trajectories resulting in nearly identical parasitic life history syndromes."
