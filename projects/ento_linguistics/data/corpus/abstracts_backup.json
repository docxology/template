    "Synergistic anticancer effects of tamoxifen in combination with fisetin and chrysin on breast cancer cells: insights into viability, migration, and apoptosis.. Karami-Dehkordi N, Reiisi S, Feizi-Dehnayebi M (2026). Breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality among women worldwide. Tamoxifen (TX) is widely used for the treatment of estrogen receptor-positive (ER⁺) breast cancer; however, the development of drug resistance limits its long-term therapeutic effectiveness. Fisetin (Fis) and chrysin (Chry) are naturally occurring flavonoids that have demonstrated anticancer properties, including inhibition of cell proliferation and migration and induction of apoptosis. In this study, we evaluated the anticancer effects of Fis and Chry, individually and in combination with TX, in ER⁺ MCF-7 and triple-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines. Cells were treated with varying concentrations of Fis or Chry alone or in combination with TX. Cell viability was assessed using the MTT assay, while migratory and clonogenic capacities were evaluated by wound-healing and colony formation assays, respectively. Apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry, and the expression of invasion-related genes (MMP2 and MMP9) was quantified using real-time PCR. The results showed that Fis, Chry, and TX individually reduced cell viability, migration, and colony formation in both cell lines. Notably, combination treatments exerted significantly stronger cytotoxic and pro-apoptotic effects compared to single-agent treatments. Combination index (CI) analysis revealed CI values below 1, indicating a synergistic interaction between TX and the flavonoids. Furthermore, co-treatment markedly downregulated MMP2 and MMP9 expression. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that fisetin and chrysin enhance the anticancer efficacy of tamoxifen through synergistic mechanisms in breast cancer cells.",
    "Antimicrobial Efficacy of Calcium Hydroxide Nanoparticles Combined with Nisin Against Enterococcus Faecalis in Root Canal Infections ��� an Ex Vivo Study.. Sidiqa AN, Zakaria MN, Joni IM, Maskoen AM, Cahyanto A (2025). OBJECTIVE: This ex-vivo study aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial effects of calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) nanoparticles combined with nisin against Enterococcus faecalis in infected root canals. METHODS: The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC50) and Fractional Inhibitory Concentration (FIC) index were determined to assess the potential synergistic effect of the combination. Root canal specimens infected with E. faecalis were divided into three treatment groups: Ca(OH)2 nanoparticles with nisin, Ca(OH)2 nanoparticles alone, and a control group with no treatment. Colony Forming Units (CFU) were quantified at different dentinal depths, and the relative gene expression of E. faecalis was analysed using quantitative PCR. RESULTS: MIC50 was not achieved by Ca(OH)2, while nisin had an MIC of 50 mg/mL. FIC analysis indicated no synergistic interaction between Ca(OH)2 and nisin. From the root canal specimen model, Ca(OH)2 nanoparticles alone and the combination of Ca(OH)2 nanoparticles and nisin disinfected dentinal tubules up to 1.3 mm. However, neither group achieved disinfection at a depth of 1.5 mm. Relative gene expression analysis showed that the combination treatment significantly reduced E. faecalis gene expression compared to Ca(OH)2 alone. CONCLUSION: The combination of Ca(OH)2 nanoparticles and nisin does not improve the antimicrobial activity of Ca(OH)2 nanoparticles against E. faecalis, suggesting independent antimicrobial activity of both agents.

    "Male Rats Carrying the Taiep Mutation Show Alterations in the Dendritic Arborization of CA1 and CA3 Neurons.. Medina-Flores F, Bravo-Durán DA, Robles-Soto R, Silva-Gómez AB (2026). The taiep rat originated from a spontaneous mutation in a colony of Sprague-Dawley rats, whose phenotype is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. The mutant taiep rat shows hypomyelination and demyelination of the central nervous system (CNS) and has been considered a chronic animal model of multiple sclerosis and tubulinopathies. Unlike taiep rats, heterozygous rats for the mutation (+/-), referred to as carriers, have not been widely studied. Thus, the objective of the present study was to examine the dendritic arborization and dendritic spine density of CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons of taiep mutation carriers. We evaluated the following groups: Sprague-Dawley rats as a control (SD), mutation carriers (Carrier), and taiep rats (taiep). The brains of the animals were processed using the Golgi-Cox technique to analyze the basilar and apical dendritic arborization and dendritic spine density of CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons. We observed a decrease in dendritic arborization in the basilar arbors of dorsal hippocampal CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons in both carrier and taiep adult rats, as well as a decrease in dendritic arborization in the apical arbors of CA3 neurons in carrier rats. Moreover, dendritic spine density was reduced in CA1 neurons in both rats. These results show that even when rats are mutation carriers, they exhibit alterations in the dendritic arborization of dorsal hippocampal neurons similar to those of taiep rats.",
    "Real-world clinical outcomes of autologous stem cell transplantation in Chinese patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma: a systematic literature review.. You J, Zhang Y, Meng Y, Zhao Y, Huang H, Chen W, Meng J (2026). OBJECTIVE: This systematic literature review analyzed real-world evidence on autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (ndMM) in China. METHODS: Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, major English and Chinese databases were searched for observational studies published between 2015 and 2025 that included Chinese ndMM patients eligible for ASCT. Extracted data covered patient characteristics, treatment responses, and survival outcomes associated with ASCT and non-ASCT treatments. Single-arm meta-analysis with a random-effects model was used for evidence synthesis and pooled outcomes of the treatments for the same phase were compared using Cochran's Q or chi-square tests. RESULTS: Eighty-eight observational studies (2015-2025) were included. Data were pooled using single-arm meta-analysis and the pooled outcomes for ASCT and non-ASCT treatments were compared using Cochran's Q or chi-square tests. Compared to patients receiving non-ASCT treatments, ASCT recipients were younger (54.5 years vs 61.4 years), had more early-stage disease (International Staging System (ISS) I: 25.8% vs 15.1%), more t(11;14) (14.1% vs 6.0%), and fewer complex karyotypes (2.9% vs 31.7%). Plerixafor plus granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) significantly improved mobilization success over cyclophosphamide plus G-CSF (73.6% vs 49.5%), though with slightly delayed engraftment. ASCT was associated with superior treatment response (complete response: 78.5% vs 45.3%; very good partial response (⩾VGPR): 98.6% vs 75.0%) and higher 5-year overall survival rate (70.6% vs 41.3%) and 5-year progression-free survival rate (41.3% vs 18.0%). Advanced revised-ISS stage, IgD subtype, and suboptimal pre-ASCT response were associated with poorer survival prognosis in ASCT recipients. CONCLUSION: Chinese ASCT recipients had more favorable baseline profiles and achieved significantly better clinical outcomes than those receiving non-ASCT treatments. Plerixafor-based mobilization enhanced stem cell collection success. However, advanced stage, IgD subtype, and inadequate pre-ASCT response could discount the effectiveness of ASCT. INPLASY REGISTRATION NUMBER: INPLASY2025110069. A systematic review of real-world outcomes of autologous stem cell transplantation in Chinese patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma Why was the study done? Multiple myeloma is a type of blood cancer. A treatment called autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) can improve outcomes, but not all patients are eligible. In China, more studies have recently looked at how ASCT works in real-world patients. This systematic review brought together results from many studies to better understand whether ASCT provides better results compared to other treatments. What did the researchers do? The research team systematically reviewed and combined results from 88 real-world studies published between 2015 and 2025. They compared patient characteristics, treatment response, and survival outcomes between patients who received ASCT and those who did not. They also looked at which factors influenced the success of ASCT. What did the researchers find? Patients who underwent ASCT were generally younger and had less advanced disease than those who did not. Using plerixafor plus G-CSF helped doctors collect stem cells more successfully than older methods. ASCT led to much higher treatment response rates and longer survival: about 7 in 10 patients were still alive 5 years after transplant, compared with about 4 in 10 without transplant. However, patients with advanced disease stage, IgD subtype myeloma, or weaker treatment response before transplant had worse outcomes even with ASCT. What do the findings mean? This systematic review shows that in real-world Chinese patients, ASCT provided much better outcomes than non-transplant treatments. Newer ways to collect stem cells, such as plerixafor-based regimens, improved success rates. However, patients with certain high-risk features may need additional treatment strategies to maximize the benefits of ASCT.",
    "Case Report: Bloodstream infection due to Clostridium innocuum combined with Eggerthella lenta.. Xu Y, Xu A, Du J, Zhao Y, Liu X, Sun Z, Xu Q, Zhang M, Tian YR (2026). BACKGROUND: The co-infection of Clostridium innocuum and Eggerthella lenta in bloodstream is uncommon. The choice of clinical drugs with which to treat such co-infection is limited, which is worthy of study. CASE PRESENTATION: A 58-year-old male patient was admitted to the Department of General Surgery of Huashan Hospital on May, for further treatment after chemotherapy for liver metastases from rectal cancer. Laparoscopic anterior rectal resection under general anesthesia, laparoscopic sigmoid-rectal anastomosis, laparoscopic mesenteric lymphadenectomy, laparoscopic temporary ileostomy, and segmentectomy were performed. On the 3rd day after surgery, the patient developed a fever with body temperature up to 38 °C accompanied by cough and yellow sputum. Chest CT showed possible bilateral lung inflammation and metastases. Empirical anti-infection and symptomatic and supportive treatment were given. The patient still had a fever, with a body temperature of up to 40.6 °C, accompanied by fear of cold and chills, abdominal pain and abdominal distension on physical examination, abdominal wound non-healing, visible purulent secretions, and increased C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and other inflammatory indicators. Aerobic and anaerobic blood culture tests were performed. The anaerobic blood culture bottle was positive after incubation in the automatic incubator for 20 h. After 24 h of anaerobic subculture on blood plate. C. innocuum was identified by matter-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of Flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. After anaerobic culture time was extended to 72 h, another small slow-growing colony was observed, and E. lenta was identified. The patient's postoperative history of rectal cancer showed the possibility of intestinal colonizing bacteria invading the bloodstream and causing infection. According to pieces of literature and drug sensitivity tests in our center, vancomycin 1 g + piperacillin / tazobactam 4.5 g were administered every 12 h for anti-infection for 7 days. The patient's fever peak decreased, and blood culture turned negative after reexamination, thus the treatment was considered to be effective. Because the patient also had an abdominal infection and lung infection, antibiotic therapy with cefoperazone sulbactam and levofloxacin was continued for 9 days, and the patient had no further fever and was discharged with improved condition. CONCLUSION: Clostridium innocuum and E. lenta can cause bloodstream infection after colorectal surgery, and the above two rare anaerobic bacteria can be rapidly and economically identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. C. innocuum, and E. lenta isolated from bloodstream infections following colorectal surgery should be considered as pathogens and treated promptly and appropriately.",
    "Coevolution and Functional Effects of Endosymbiotic Rickettsia in Leptocybe invasa Fisher & LaSalle (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) Across China.. Xu X, Zhou L, Xie J, Li J, Guo C, Yang Z (2026). Rickettsia is an endosymbiotic bacterium that infects various arthropods, affecting the host's biology, ecology, and evolution. Leptocybe invasa is an invasive pest that severely damages eucalyptus plants. A comprehensive investigation of Rickettsia in 313 female L. invasa individuals from 17 Chinese populations revealed a 100% infection prevalence. Sequencing of three host molecular markers-mitochondrial COI, nuclear ITS, and 28S-led to the identification of a novel L. invasa haplotype, designated Haplotype 1 × 2, which exhibits mito-nuclear discordance. Concurrently, sequencing of four Rickettsia genes (16S rRNA, gltA, atpA, rpmE) revealed two distinct strains, termed STRiA and STRiB. These strains demonstrated a specific association with the host lineages, where STRiA was exclusively associated with lineage A (comprising Haplotype 1 and Haplotype 1 × 2), and STRiB was linked to lineage B. Phylogenetic analysis of the multigene datasets from both the host and Rickettsia revealed a high degree of topological congruence between their inferred trees. Correlation analysis further demonstrated a moderate positive association (r = 0.307). The significance of this relationship was supported by a Mantel test (p < 0.005), suggesting coevolution. Low-dose tetracycline treatment effectively eliminated Rickettsia from L. invasa. L. invasa treated with tetracycline exhibited a significantly higher proportion of male offspring, reduced Rickettsia expression, and decreased body length and lifespan in female offspring. Transcriptome analysis comparing Rickettsia-free and Rickettsia-infected L. invasa following antibiotic treatment identified 178 differentially expressed genes (122 up-regulated, 56 down-regulated). These genes were enriched in GO terms related to metabolic processes, cellular processes, cellular components, binding functions, and catalytic activities. KEGG pathway analysis revealed enrichment of differentially expressed genes primarily in metabolic pathways, insect hormone biosynthesis, and thermogenesis. Additionally, enrichment was observed in key signaling pathways, including Ras, MAPK, NF-κB, TGF-β, TNF, and Apelin. These findings elucidate the coevolutionary relationship and functional roles of Rickettsia in L. invasa, providing a foundation for symbiont-mediated biological control.",
    "Living on the Edge: Juvenile Foraging and Adult Breeding Ecology of an Aerial Top Predator in Urban Environments.. Engler M, Krone O (2026). Urbanization is irreversibly transforming natural ecosystems globally, yet we still lack a holistic understanding of the challenges and opportunities that urban environments present to wildlife. To investigate how raptors utilize urban landscapes, we analyzed 4 years of GPS tracking data of 22 juveniles collected during natal dispersal, combined with 7 years of nest-monitoring data from an urban population of the Common Buzzard (Buteo buteo), an opportunistic rodent specialist, in Berlin (Germany). Our goals were threefold: (a) to estimate core foraging ranges (CFRs), (b) to characterize small-scale temporal foraging areas (TFAs) within these ranges, and (c) to model the breeding habitat suitability based on environmental predictors. CFRs were distributed across the city, with a mean area of 11.0 km2 (±13.9 sd). TFAs within these ranges had a mean area of 0.2 km2 (±0.3) and were occupied over a mean time span of 274 days (±198). TFAs were mostly located in residential open areas (e.g., courtyards) and were characterized by decreasing area and shorter occupation duration with increasing human population density. Urban TFAs showed a high prevalence of rats (Rattus norvegicus). Active pest control measures were observed at most TFAs, particularly in residential areas. We mapped a total of 17.3 km2 of suitable breeding habitat within the study area (217 km2) and 45.4 km2 when projected across the city region (890 km2). Suitable breeding habitat consisted of isolated patches, i.e., single courtyards in residential areas, and a network of urban green spaces, e.g., city parks and cemeteries. Cities can provide profitable foraging and breeding conditions for raptors, with abundant prey in proximity to suitable breeding sites. The study improves our understanding of how raptors utilize the urban city landscape and underlines the importance of urban green spaces as a basis for the protection and conservation of urban wildlife.",
    "Heterospecific Dominance Hierarchy in Roosting Site Selection at a Shared Nest Resource.. Lowney AM, Thomson RL (2026). The resources needed by different species are fundamental for allowing multiple species to coexist. However, when species share resources, competition is expected to occur with associated costs. Sociable weavers (Philetairus socius) build large communal nests that provide, among other resources, nesting chambers that provide shelter, protection, thermal buffering and insulation for roosting birds of other species. We consider the interactions of heterospecifics roosting in colonies to determine if species select chambers due to their insulation properties, if there is a dominance hierarchy in acquiring chambers, and/or if novel behaviours to access chambers are employed. Our study demonstrates that different species use different aspects of the nest resource, preferring roosting chambers depending on the location of the chamber within the colony. To access this resource, we show that aggressive interactions occur between the species, resulting in a dominance hierarchy with size being positively related to the dominance of a species. Furthermore, our data show temporal separation in timing of arrival at the chambers, with smaller species tending to arrive later and occupy vacant chambers, thus avoiding aggressive interactions with more dominant heterospecifics. Therefore, adapting to competition, multiple species use novel behaviours and interactions, allowing them to coexist at this same engineered resource.",
    "Effect of Moringa oleifera Protein-Coated Gold Nanoparticles as Naturally Derived Disruptors of Biofilms.. Menon LS, Ghosh N, Biswas S (2026). BACKGROUND: Microbes having affinity to metallic surfaces develop a highly structured and sessile colony known as biofilms which poses significant challenges to the domain of implant surgery. Biofilm-mediated infections and the associated burden have prompted the search for multipronged approaches to tackle the problem. Gram-positive pathogens, most notably Staphylococcus aureus, has been known to colonize human tracts and form biofilms on implants and prosthetic devices. Antibiotic tolerance, drug efflux, and recalcitrance to the host immune response have added to the existing predicament of the biofilm infections. OBJECTIVE: The search for inexpensive but effective avenues for combating biofilms has led to the use of metal nanoparticles conjugated with plant-derived proteins. METHODS: In this study, a protein from Moringa oleifera leaf extract, p62, which has been previously identified to have antibiofilm properties, was conjugated with spherical gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to target S. aureus biofilm formation. RESULTS: The adsorption of p62 on the AuNPs was confirmed through microscopy, and the kinetics of binding was determined by plasmon resonance. The p62 coated AuNPs remained stable in solution and caused the successful disintegration of mature biofilms, more efficiently than the protein alone. The p62-AuNPs were also found to disrupt the morphology of the cocci and cause cell death as evidenced from the live/dead cell imaging through confocal microscopy. The protein and the nanoparticle were not cytotoxic to C2C12 human myoblast cell lines, affirming their suitability to be used on implants.",
    "Evaluation of the efficacy of the automatic ozone decontamination device in a real-life setting of an intravitreal injection room.. Salom D, Adloff-Alonso A, Salvador Aguilá M, Martínez-Rubio C, Janicka-Caulineau A, Moro-Muniz M, Rodrigo R (2026). OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of an ozonation system for disinfecting intravitreal injection rooms. DESIGN: A prospective intervention pilot study was conducted with a 'before-and-after' design. SETTING: The study was conducted in an intravitreal injection room at Hospital de Manises. METHODS: Air and surface samples were taken before and after ozonation using a remote-controlled ozonation system. The room was treated with ozone at a concentration of 9-10 ppm for 20 min. Measurements were taken immediately after, 12 h, and 24 h post ozonation. Statistical analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. RESULTS: At 24 h post ozonation, significant reductions in microbial load were observed: in the centre of the room, the bacterial load reduced from >250 colony-forming units (cfu) to 10 cfu (96%) and fungi from 14 cfu to <1 cfu (93.1%) (P < 0.05); in the diffuser, the bacterial load reduced from 61 cfu to 24 cfu (60.7%) and fungi from 6 cfu to <1 cfu (100%) (P < 0.05) and on the procedure chair, the bacterial load reduced from 51 cfu to 7 cfu (86.3%) and fungi from 6 cfu to 3 cfu (50%) (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In a dedicated intravitreal injection room, a remotely controlled ozonation cycle at 9-10 ppm for 20 min was associated with substantial short-term reductions in airborne and selected surface microbial load under unoccupied conditions. Automated ozonation may complement routine cleaning and ventilation to maintain low environmental bioburden; its clinical impact remains to be determined.",
    "Comprehensive virome analysis of Varroa destructor populations in South Korea.. Kim JY, Moon KH, Kim YH, Eliash N, Yoon JS (2026). The ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor and the viruses it transmits pose a significant threat to honey bee health (Apis mellifera), contributing to colony collapse disorder. In this study, a metatranscriptomic analysis of V. destructor from six regions in South Korea was conducted to characterize its viral communities. Using high-throughput sequencing (HTS), we identified 16 known viruses and classified them into three groups: honey bee-pathogenic, Varroa destructor viruses (VDVs), and viruses with unknown hosts. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to validate the HTS results, revealing only two discrepancies out of 96 comparisons. This emphasizes the importance of integrating both methods for comprehensive virome analysis. Deformed wing virus was the most prevalent and abundant virus, comprising 75%-99% of viral reads in five out of six farms. One farm showed a high abundance of VDVs (3 and 9). Notably, two previously unreported viruses with unknown hosts, Hubei partiti-like virus 34 and Lilac leaf chlorosis virus (LLCV), were identified. For LLCV, the detection of all ribonucleic acid segments highlighted the critical impact of sequencing depth on viral genome analysis. To our knowledge, this study provides the first virome characterization of V. destructor in South Korea, revealing diverse viral communities. It also proposes an integrated analytical approach using RT-PCR and HTS, emphasizing the importance of sequencing depth. This analysis provides valuable insights into the potential impacts of viral infections on honey bee colony health and the epidemiology of viral transmission.",
    "Integrating traditional omics and AI-driven approaches for discovery and validation of novel MicroRNA biomarkers and therapeutic targets in thyroid cancer.. Wan Y, Xie D, Zhang M, Yang S, Zhang Z, Fu X, Wang M, Zhao Y (2025). BACKGROUND: The discovery of reliable biomarkers and therapeutic targets remains a critical challenge in thyroid cancer management. This study demonstrates the value of integrating traditional omics technologies with artificial intelligence approaches and single-cell validation to identify novel microRNA-based biomarkers and drug targets. We hypothesized that combining meta-analysis of bulk transcriptomics, machine learning-driven feature selection, and single-cell spatial mapping would enhance biomarker discovery and validation compared to using either approach independently. METHODS: We employed a hybrid strategy integrating traditional transcriptomic analysis with AI-driven methods. Meta-analysis of three bulk RNA-seq datasets (GSE65144, GSE33630, GSE50901) was performed using effect size analysis, followed by machine learning-based forward feature selection to identify optimal biomarker combinations. Single-cell RNA-seq data (GSE184362, 196,145 cells from 23 thyroid cancer samples) provided cell-type-specific validation and immune microenvironment profiling. Comprehensive experimental validation was conducted using TPC-1 and BHT101 cell lines through miR-6756-5p overexpression and CRISPRi-mediated knockdown, including functional assays and xenograft experiments to establish therapeutic potential. RESULTS: The AI-enhanced meta-analysis identified a four-gene diagnostic panel (BID, MIR6756, ITM2A, TGM2) achieving exceptional performance with AUC values of 1.0 and 0.99 in training sets and 0.74 in independent validation. Single-cell analysis of 50,000 cells revealed six major cell types with significant immune infiltration (61.9%), providing crucial cell-type specificity for the identified biomarkers. BID and ITM2A showed predominantly epithelial expression, while TGM2 was enriched in immune and stromal compartments, demonstrating multi-cellular biomarker patterns. Immune microenvironment analysis revealed distinct CD8+/CD4+ T cell ratios between metastatic and non-metastatic samples. hsa-miR-6756-5p, identified through this integrated approach, exhibited tumor-specific expression and demonstrated oncogenic properties by promoting proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion in vitro, while enhancing tumor growth in vivo, validating it as a novel therapeutic target. DISCUSSION: Our study exemplifies the synergistic value of integrating traditional omics approaches with AI-driven analytics for biomarker and drug target discovery. The combination of machine learning-based feature selection from bulk transcriptomics with single-cell spatial validation addresses limitations of each approach used independently. This integrated framework successfully identified has-miR-6756-5p as both a diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target, demonstrating how traditional experimental validation coupled with computational prediction enhances translational potential. The multi-scale approach spanning bulk transcriptomics, AI-driven biomarker selection, single-cell characterization, and functional validation represents an effective paradigm for developing clinically relevant cancer biomarkers and therapeutic targets.",
    "Gentamicin fails to eradicate Staphylococcus aureus biofilm in vitro, even in combination with rifampin.. Boot W, Schläppi M, Post V, Moriarty TF, Wahl P (2026). Introduction: Biofilm formation is one of the key elements making orthopaedic device-related infections (ODRIs) difficult to eradicate. Aminoglycosides such as gentamicin are frequently applied via local carriers, and systemic rifampin is added for its anti-biofilm activity. However, robust in vitro evidence of their ability to eradicate mature biofilm is limited. This study assessed whether gentamicin, alone or in combination with rifampin, can eradicate established Staphylococcus aureus biofilm in vitro. Methods: A clinical methicillin-susceptible S. aureus isolate was grown as a 5 d old biofilm on a peg lid microtiter plate. Three exposure regimens were tested: (i) continuous exposure to gentamicin (15-2000 mg L-1) for 28 d, (ii) intermittent 2 h exposures twice daily (at 15, 250 and 2000 mg L-1) for 28 d to reflect systemic twice-daily dosing and (iii) a 14 d burst release starting at 2000 mg L-1 with stepwise decline to model release from local carriers. Rifampin was either absent or added at 3.3 mg L-1, approximating peri-implant concentrations from preclinical pharmacokinetic studies. Biofilm viability was quantified as colony-forming units (CFUs) from sonicated pegs, and selected surviving isolates underwent susceptibility testing. Results: Across all regimens, concentration- and time-dependent decreases in CFU counts were observed, but no regimen resulted in bacterial counts falling below the lower limit of detection (LLOD). The addition of rifampin did not result in the sustained enhancement of biofilm killing, and, in some regimens, resulted in higher CFU counts. Isolates recovered from culture-positive pegs remained largely susceptible to gentamicin, whereas rifampin resistance arose sporadically. Conclusion: High-dose gentamicin exposures failed to eradicate 5 d old S. aureus biofilm in vitro, whatever the administration regimen. Rifampin co-administration did not alter the final outcome of biofilm persistence, despite its well-recognised anti-biofilm activity. These findings challenge the reliance on aminoglycoside-loaded carriers as curative strategies for ODRIs and suggest that persistent viability may reflect antibiotic tolerance that may not be overcome by antibiotics alone.",
    "Evolutionary Transitions in Social Behavior are Associated With Convergent and Partially Reversible Expansions of Transcription Factor Binding Sites.. Ploessl SG, Jones BM (2026). The evolution of sociality involves shifts in physiology and behavior, most notably the emergence of a reproductive division of labor. Within social colonies, these distinct behavioral phenotypes arise from differential regulation of a shared genome. Changes in transcription factor (TF) binding motifs are one potential mechanism underpinning this plasticity, with prior studies suggesting that social species exhibit expansions in TF binding sites. However, it remains unclear whether motif expansions are reversed when sociality is lost. Here we analyze predicted TF motif occurrences across gene promoters in 42 bee species spanning millions of years of evolutionary divergence and multiple independent gains and losses of sociality. We compare motif presence across species to test whether motif expansions are a convergent feature of social evolution and whether their presence secondarily decreases when social behavior is lost. Our findings are consistent with previous research, demonstrating an expansion of TF motifs in lineages which have gained sociality. However, contrary to expectation, we do not observe genome-wide motif contractions in lineages which have secondarily lost social behavior. Despite this overall pattern, we still identify several motifs, promoter regions, and specific motif-promoter pairs which exhibit complementary changes with both gains and losses of sociality. These regulatory targets are enriched for similar organismal functions, providing strong candidates for further study. Our results lend additional support to the hypothesis that novel phenotypes may arise through modification of existing gene regulatory networks.",
    "Foraging Under Competition in Mongolian Gerbils: The Influence of Personality and Its Physiological Basis.. Gan L, Liu W, Liu J, Wang D (2026). Personality can influence animals' competitive foraging behavior. The state-behavior feedback theory suggests that these personality-driven variations may be affected by physiological states. However, the impact of personality on competitive foraging behavior within a species, as well as the physiological states associated with these variations in personality-driven foraging behavior, remains unclear. In this study, we investigated changes in foraging behavior between bold and shy Mongolian gerbils across three distinct contexts: (1) non-competitive foraging contexts, (2) a competition-introduced context at a feeding site, and (3) competitor relocation to another feeding site. We also explored the potential hormonal and energy balance factors that may influence these behavioral variations. Our results revealed that bold gerbils exhibited a consistently greater tendency to compete in two competitive contexts. Shy gerbils opted for lower-cost and more easily obtainable food resources in the competition-introduced context but displayed a similarly high tendency to compete during the competitor transfer context. Although we did not find a significant difference in fecal production, digestibility, basal metabolic rate, or blood corticosterone levels between bold and shy gerbils, bolder gerbils exhibited lower body mass and daily energy expenditure but higher food intake. Our findings indicate that Mongolian gerbils exhibited personality-driven competitive foraging strategies during intraspecific competition, which may be influenced more by differences in energy allocation than by competition pressure. This study provides empirical evidence to enhance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying personality variation in behavior and the personality-driven behavioral plasticity based on the state-behavior feedback framework.",
    "Trait Hierarchy and Interactive Effects Govern Seed Fate in Rodent-Mediated Dispersal: Insights from Coat Thickness, Nutrients, and Tannins.. Liang H, Fu L, Ma F, Zhao K, Hou Z, Guo J, Yang X (2026). Seed traits play a pivotal role in shaping rodent-mediated seed dispersal, a key process driving forest regeneration. However, disentangling the independent and interactive effects of physical (coat thickness), nutritional, and chemical (tannin) traits remains challenging due to their natural covariation. Using artificial seeds in enclosures, we quantified how these traits influence foraging decisions by Leopoldamys edwardsi, a dominant scatter-hoarding rodent in subtropical forests. Our results revealed a hierarchical order of trait importance: nutrient content > tannin content > coat thickness. High-nutrient seeds were preferentially consumed, while moderately nutrient-rich seeds (50% peanut powder) were most frequently scatter-hoarded, balancing immediate energy gain and long-term storage. Tannins exerted a dual effect: low concentrations (0.5%) enhanced consumption, likely due to reduced microbial decay, whereas high concentrations (7%) deterred both consumption and hoarding by impairing digestibility. Coat thickness had weaker effects but interacted with nutrients, as thin-coated, high-nutrient seeds were favored for both consumption and hoarding. Interactive effects highlighted a \"benefit-first\" decision framework, where rodents prioritize energy gain (nutrients), then modulate behavior to preserve benefits (tannins aiding storage), and finally account for handling costs (coat thickness). These findings illuminate coevolutionary dynamics between rodents and seeds, emphasizing how trait combinations shape mutualistic interactions critical for forest dynamics. Our study provides a mechanistic basis for predicting how shifts in seed traits may disrupt these interactions, with implications for ecosystem management.",
    "Seco-Duocarmycin SA Augments the Impact of Proton Radiation on Human Glioblastoma Cells.. Morcos A, Galvan Bustillos J, Jung Y, Fuller RN, Bertucci A, Caba Molina D, Nguyen A, Zhang Q, Boyle KE, Langridge WHR, Vazquez M, Wall NR (2026). Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is an aggressive brain tumor with limited treatment options and poor survival outcomes. This study evaluated the anticancer potential of seco-duocarmycin SA (seco-DSA), a potent DNA-alkylating agent, alone and in combination with proton radiation in human GBM cell lines. Human glioblastoma cell lines T98G and LN18 were treated with varying concentrations of seco-DSA, proton radiation doses (2, 4, or 8 Gy), or both. Proton irradiation was delivered with a 250-MeV beam. Clonogenic survival, cell proliferation, and cell cycle distribution were analyzed using colony formation and flow cytometry assays. Proteomic analysis of LN18 cells was performed by LC-MS/MS followed by bioinformatic pathway analysis. Statistical significance was determined using a two-tailed unpaired t-test (p ≤ 0.05), and Bliss synergy scores were calculated to assess treatment interactions. Combination therapy produced additive and synergistic inhibition of colony formation and enhanced G2/M phase arrest compared with either treatment alone. Apoptosis and necrosis increased modestly but did not fully account for observed cytotoxicity. Proteomic profiling revealed differential expression of proteins involved in DNA repair, apoptosis, and senescence, indicating that seco-DSA broadened radiation-induced stress responses. Seco-DSA potentiates the cytotoxic effects of proton radiation in GBM cells through enhanced clonogenic inhibition and modulation of cell cycle and DNA repair pathways. These findings support seco-DSA as a promising radiosensitizer for further preclinical evaluation.",
    "Targeted RNA Degradation by RIBOTACs: A Novel Therapeutic Avenue for Ophthalmic Diseases.. Rusciano D, Gagliano C, Avitabile A, Maya-Vetencourt JF (2026). Ophthalmic diseases, including inherited retinal dystrophies, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and glaucomatous neuropathies, are often driven by the expression of pathogenic proteins or dysfunctional non-coding RNAs that are currently considered 'undruggable' with conventional small-molecule therapeutics. The emerging strategy of Ribonuclease-Targeting Chimeras (RIBOTACs) offers a revolutionary approach to address this therapeutic gap. RIBOTACs are heterobifunctional small molecules designed to bind a specific target RNA with one moiety and recruit a latent endogenous ribonuclease, such as RNase L, with the other, thereby catalyzing the RNA's degradation. This targeted degradation can potentially halt the production of mutant proteins, eliminate toxic gain-of-function RNAs, or modulate key regulatory pathways involved in angiogenesis, inflammation, and apoptosis-core processes in many blinding diseases. This review explores the immense potential of applying RIBOTAC technology to ophthalmology, discussing prospective targets such as mutant alleles in retinitis pigmentosa, VEGF transcripts in neovascular AMD, and inflammatory mediators in uveitis. We will also address the unique challenges and opportunities for RIBOTAC development in the eye, including delivery strategies to overcome ocular barriers, the need for high specificity to avoid off-target RNA degradation, and the optimization of pharmacokinetic properties for intraocular administration. With continued innovation, RIBOTACs are poised to evolve into a robust therapeutic platform, expanding the druggable genome and enabling precise, durable treatments for a range of currently intractable ophthalmic conditions.",
    "Peri-Transfer Glucocorticoid Therapy in Oocyte-Donation IVF Bridging the Immunological Gap.. Voros C, Chatzinikolaou F, Papadimas G, Polykalas S, Mavrogianni D, Koulakmanidis AM, Athanasiou D, Kanaka V, Bananis K, Athanasiou A, Athanasiou A, Papapanagiotou I, Tsimpoukelis C, Karpouzos A, Daskalaki MA, Kanakas N, Theodora M, Thomakos N, Antsaklis P, Loutradis D, Daskalakis G (2026). In vitro fertilisation via oocyte donation is a unique reproductive technique in which the embryo is fully separate from the receiver. This compels the immune system to exert more effort at the interface between the uterus and the remainder of the body. This setting has maintained interest in peri-transfer glucocorticoid treatment as a possible approach to modify endometrial immunity and enhance implantation. Nevertheless, the data for this procedure are disjointed and mostly derive from investigations on autologous in vitro fertilisation. This narrative review consolidates contemporary evidence on endometrial immunology in oocyte donation cycles, analysing the mechanistic basis, clinical results, and constraints related to peri-implantation glucocorticoid therapy. Outcomes from randomised studies in autologous cycles consistently demonstrate that there is no advantage in live birth rates, but the claimed improvements in clinical pregnancy rates are from heterogeneous and low-quality data. Limited research exists on people who have received oocyte donations. The majority are diminutive and non-random, often integrating glucocorticoids with other therapies such as antibiotics, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, or endometrial damage. These designs inhibit the dissociation of the independent impact of glucocorticoids. Recent comprehensive randomised studies on recurrent implantation failure further demonstrate the lack of advantages in live births and highlight possible safety issues. The current data do not support the usual use of peri-transfer glucocorticoids in oocyte donation for in vitro fertilisation; nevertheless, short-term, low-dose treatment may be justified in meticulously chosen immunological profiles. There is an urgent need for rigorously designed randomised studies focused only on oocyte-donation recipients to elucidate the therapeutic effectiveness, safety, and suitable clinical context for glucocorticoid treatment in this expanding patient demographic.",
    "Immunosenescence and Allergy: Molecular and Cellular Links Between Inflammaging, Neuro-Immune Aging, and Response to Biologic Therapies.. Aitella E, Azzellino G, Cammisuli BA, De Benedictis C, Di Mattia D, Romano C, Ginaldi L, De Martinis M (2026). With the global increase in population aging, allergic diseases in older adults are becoming an increasingly relevant clinical and public health challenge. Age-related molecular and cellular alterations significantly affect the pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of major allergic diseases in the elderly. This review focuses on immunosenescence in major allergic conditions, including asthma, chronic urticaria and angioedema, dermatitis, food and drug allergies, and hymenoptera venom hypersensitivity. Particular emphasis is placed on molecular mechanisms underlying immune aging, such as inflammaging, dysregulation of innate and adaptive immune responses, epithelial barrier dysfunction, microbiota alterations, neuro-immune interactions, and age-related comorbidities. Sex-related differences in immune responses are also addressed, together with current diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, including the opportunities and limitations of biologic therapies in aging populations. Despite growing interest in this field, a major limitation remains the paucity of studies specifically targeting geriatric populations, underscoring the need for age- and sex-specific research and dedicated clinical trials. A personalized approach integrating frailty assessment and immune profiling is essential to optimize the management of allergic diseases in older adults.",
    "Transcriptomic Responses of Sclerodermus alternatusi Yang to Ultraviolet (UV) Stress of Different Wavelengths.. Li F, Jin W, Cheng H, Wu F, Pan Y, Zhu D, Xu S, Zhou C, Zhang B, Chakraborty A, Roy A, He S (2026). Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is a significant environmental stressor that exerts profound impacts on insect physiology, behaviour and survival. Although some insects can use UV light for spatial orientation and navigation, it can induce DNA damage, oxidative stress, and impair critical biological functions, ultimately reducing ecological fitness. Sclerodermus alternatusi Yang (Hymenoptera: Bethylidae) is a dominant ectoparasitoid of the early instar larvae of Monochamus alternatus and plays a key role in the biological control of this pest in forestry systems; however, it faces intense UV exposure in the field environment. Despite its ecological importance, the molecular mechanisms underlying its responses to UV-induced stress remain poorly understood. In this study, newly emerged adult wasps (within 24 h post-eclosion) were exposed to UVA (365 nm) and UVC (253.7 nm) radiation for 9 h under controlled laboratory conditions. Total RNA was extracted from treated and control individuals for transcriptomic analysis using RNA-Seq. A total of 505 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified; gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed that UVA exposure significantly upregulated genes involved in cellular respiration and oxidative phosphorylation, suggesting an enhanced metabolic response. Furthermore, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis revealed that UV stress modulates energy metabolism through the activation of oxidative phosphorylation and thermogenesis-related pathways, highlighting the reallocation of energy resources in response to UV-induced stress. To validate the RNA-Seq data, four representative DEGs were selected for quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis. The qPCR results were consistent with the transcriptomic trends, confirming the reliability of the sequencing data. Collectively, this study provides a comprehensive overview of the molecular response mechanisms of S. alternatusi to UV stress, offering novel insights into its environmental adaptability and laying a theoretical foundation for its application in biological pest control under field conditions.",
    "Beyond Resistance: Phenotypic Plasticity in Bacterial Responses to Antibiotics, Oxidative Stress and Antimicrobial Photodynamic Inactivation.. Rapacka-Zdonczyk A (2026). The global challenge of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has been framed primarily in terms of genetic resistance mechanisms. Nevertheless, bacteria can also survive antimicrobial stress through phenotypic plasticity, resulting in transient, non-genetic states such as tolerance, persistence, and population-level resilience. These phenotypic states complicate diagnostic efforts, diminish antibiotic efficacy, and contribute to the chronic nature of infections even in the absence of heritable resistance. This review evaluates phenotypic plasticity as a significant yet underrecognized factor in AMR, with a focus on responses to oxidative and photodynamic stress. Key manifestations of plasticity are discussed, including morphological and metabolic remodeling such as filamentation, small-colony variants, and metabolic rewiring, as well as envelope- and biofilm-associated heterogeneity and regulatory flexibility mediated by gene networks and horizontal regulatory transfer. The review highlights plastic responses elicited by reactive oxygen species-mediated stress and antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation, where single-cell heterogeneity, biofilm and mucus barriers, and light-dependent cues influence bacterial survival. Case studies are presented to demonstrate how photodynamic strategies can induce transient protective states and act synergistically with antibiotics, revealing mechanisms of action that extend beyond conventional single-target therapeutic models. Drawing on evidence from single-cell analyses, biofilm ecology, and experimental evolution, this review establishes phenotypic plasticity as a central element in the chemical biology of AMR. Enhanced understanding of plasticity is essential for advancing diagnostics, informing the development of adjuvant therapies, and predicting bacterial responses to novel antimicrobial interventions.",
    "Analysis of Microbial Interactions During the Production of Chinese Ethnic Fermented Foods.. Jiang X, Li X, Song P, Dou Y, Xue J, Wu Z, Ma S, Wei W, Zheng W, Dou S, Dong L (2026). Food fermentation is an ancient bioprocess characterized by complex biochemical transformations driven primarily by microbial communities. Across the diverse regions of China, various ethnic groups have developed a rich array of traditional fermented foods through long-term practical experience. These foods are integral to local culinary heritage and provide valuable systems for studying microbial ecology and function. From the perspective of microbial interactions, this review summarizes key concepts and major interaction types-including mutualism, commensalism, and competition-and describes how bacteria, yeasts, and molds interact via metabolic division of labor to drive substrate conversion, flavor formation, preservation, and biosynthesis of functional compounds. Focusing on four representative ethnic fermented foods-Dong fermented fish, Mongoslian milk curd, Miao sour soup, and Manchurian kombucha-we analyze how microbial interactions contribute to product quality, safety, and sensory attributes. Given current challenges in industrializing traditional fermented foods, such as poor standardization and variable quality, we propose future research directions centered on modern microbiome tools, designed microbial consortia, and process optimization. This work aims to provide a scientific foundation and practical strategies for modernization and quality improvement of traditional fermented foods.",
    "Functional Characterization and Antifungal Activity of Insect-Derived Chitinases Expressed in Pichia pastoris.. Correa KCS, Ribeiro GH, Bueno OC, Colnago LA, Malavazi I, de Souza DHF (2026). Chitinases catalyze the hydrolysis of β-1,4-glycosidic bonds in chitin, a structural biopolymer synthesized by numerous organisms. Although these enzymes have been widely investigated, studies focusing on insect-derived chitinases remain limited. In this study, three recombinant chitinases from the leaf-cutter ant Atta sexdens were cloned, expressed in Pichia pastoris, and biochemically characterized. The enzymes-AsChtII-C2B3 (one catalytic and three chitin-binding domains), AsChtII-C3C4 (two catalytic domains), and AsChtII-C5B1 (one catalytic and one binding domain), exhibited optimal activity at pH 4-5 and 50 °C using colloidal chitin as substrate. Chitinase activity on colloidal α-chitin was confirmed by 1H NMR (proton nuclear magnetic resonance) spectroscopy, revealing GlcNAc concentrations of 0.41, 0.48, and 0.56 mmol L-1 for AsChtII-C3C4, AsChtII-C2B3, and AsChtII-C5B1, respectively. Their antifungal activities were evaluated against the human pathogens Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus, as well as the phytopathogen Lasiodiplodia theobromae. Distinct inhibition profiles were observed: AsChtII-C5B1 (150 µg/mL) showed the highest activity against C. albicans (87.6% inhibition), while AsChtII-C3C4 (25 µg/mL) was most effective against A. fumigatus (60% inhibition). Notably, only AsChtII-C2B3 inhibited L. theobromae growth, inducing severe hyphal deformations observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). These findings demonstrate that recombinant A. sexdens chitinases exhibit species-specific antifungal properties, underscoring their potential as biotechnological tools for medical and agricultural applications.",
    "A TP53-Pathway-Based Prognostic Signature for Radiotherapy and Functional Validation of TP53I3 in Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.. Huang X, Jiao L, Cheng X, Fang Y, Qi J, Hu Z, Hong B, Nie J, Wang H (2026). Background: Radiation therapy is an important treatment method for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, predicting patient prognosis remains challenging due to considerable interpatient heterogeneity. The TP53 signaling pathway, implicated in tumor radiosensitivity and treatment outcomes, represents a promising predictive biomarker. Accordingly, in this study, we aimed to identify TP53-signaling pathway-related genes and develop a novel prognostic model for risk stratification for NSCLC patients undergoing radiation therapy. Methods: Publicly available NSCLC transcriptomic datasets were obtained from the GEO and TCGA databases. Utilizing bioinformatics approaches, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with the TP53 signaling pathway. Feature selection was performed using LASSO regression, followed by the construction of a multivariate-Cox-regression-based prognostic prediction model. In vitro validation was performed using a cell viability assay, colony formation, cell cycle analysis, apoptosis detection, γH2AX immunofluorescence staining and comet electrophoresis. In vivo validation was performed utilizing a subcutaneous tumor-bearing mouse model, where radiosensitivity was assessed by monitoring tumor volume post-irradiation. Results: We constructed a robust prognostic prediction model based on five TP53-signaling-pathway-related genes (MDM2, THBS1, TP53I3, ATM, and SESN3), achieving a 5-year AUC of 0.828 in the training set and a 3-year AUC of 0.824 in the validation set. The model exhibited a significant ability to stratify patients into distinct high- and low-risk groups, demonstrating good predictive performance. The poor prognosis observed in the high-risk group was associated with lower infiltration of anti-tumor immune cells but higher infiltration of immunosuppressive cells. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that TP53I3 knockdown significantly enhanced the radiosensitivity of NSCLC through increased DNA damage, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Conclusions: In this study, a five-gene signature derived from the TP53 signaling pathway was developed, and the model was shown to effectively predict the prognoses of NSCLC patients undergoing radiotherapy. This signature has the potential to be developed into a clinically applicable tool for personalizing radiotherapy regimens for NSCLC.",
    "Targeting Colorectal Cancer Stem Cells Through Inhibition of the Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 4 Pathway with a Novel Antibody.. Filocamo G, Buccarelli M, Lahm A, Brunetti M, Paolini C, De Luca G, Signore M, Castellani G, Boe A, Alfonsi R, Biffoni M, De Maria R, Ricci-Vitiani L, Steinkühler C, Gallinari P (2026). BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The progression and dissemination of CRC are heavily influenced by a subpopulation of tumor cells known as CSCs. This study aimed to identify novel protein membrane antigens expressed by colorectal CSCs and the consequent development of targeted therapies based on monoclonal antibodies directed against the identified antigens. METHODS: Integrated bioinformatics analyses were conducted using proprietary CSC gene expression profiles and public colon gene expression databases, leading to the identification of five plasma membrane proteins enriched in CSCs. Genetic immunization in rats was employed to generate monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting these antigens. FGFR4 was prioritized due to its overexpression in colorectal tumors. Its function was characterized in vitro and in vivo through assays evaluating proliferation, colony formation, migration, and tumorigenicity. The anti-FGFR4 antibody 3B6 was selected based on its affinity and ability to inhibit FGFR4 signaling in CSCs. Its therapeutic potential was further assessed in xenograft models, and alterations in downstream signaling were analyzed via Western blot. RESULTS: FGFR4 emerged as a key regulator of CRC CSC proliferation, migration, and tumorigenic capacity. The 3B6 antibody, a high-affinity FGFR4 binder, demonstrated robust in vitro inhibition of CSC features and significant antitumor effects in patient-derived xenograft models. Western blot analysis confirmed the modulation of FGFR4-driven signaling pathways, particularly those involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). CONCLUSIONS: This study successfully identified several CSC-selective membrane antigens that can become therapeutic targets in CRC. Among them, we focused on FGFR4 as a promising target and developed the anti-FGFR4 3B6 monoclonal antibody which offers potential for both diagnostic and therapeutic applications.",
    "Dual Targeting of IDH2 and the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System Reveals a Functional Vulnerability in Breast Cancer Models.. Gharari N, Mereu E, Luciano B, Heidari B, Mader S, Piva R (2026). Background/Objectives: Breast cancer cells rely on both mitochondrial metabolism and proteostatic mechanisms for cell fitness. The mitochondrial enzyme IDH2 supports redox balance and biosynthesis, while the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) preserves protein quality. This study aimed to determine whether inhibiting IDH2 enhances sensitivity to proteasome-targeting agents across breast cancer subtypes. Methods: A panel of human and murine breast cancer cell lines was treated with the IDH2 inhibitor AGI-6780, alone or in combination with the proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib (CFZ) or the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme inhibitor TAK-243. Synergy was evaluated using Bliss scoring. Apoptosis, clonogenicity, and pathway modulation were assessed through Western blotting, colony-formation assays, and reverse-phase protein array (RPPA) profiling. Results: We observed that co-targeting IDH2 and the UPS produced strong synergistic cytotoxicity in multiple breast cancer models, including in triple-negative MDA-MB-231 and 4T1 cells (Bliss > 25). Combination treatments led to pronounced apoptosis, evidenced by cleaved PARP-1 and Caspase-3 cleavage, and a marked loss of clonogenic potential. RPPA analysis revealed significant alterations in key survival and stress-response pathways, including NF-κB, PI3K-p85, Src, and p38-MAPK. Conclusions: Inhibition of IDH2 markedly enhances the cytotoxic effects of proteasome-targeting by disrupting metabolic-proteostatic balance and promoting apoptotic cell death. These findings identify a growth-inhibitory effect that may be leveraged to improve functional dependency in breast cancer, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer, which currently lacks efficient drug treatments.",
    "Antitumor Effects of Broadleaf Vetch Against Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Through Dual Mechanisms: Suppressing EMT and Inducing Ferroptosis with Predicted Hepatorenal Toxicity-An Integrative Network Pharmacology and Toxicology Study.. Xing Y, Chen S, Hu K, Cui Z, Shao Y, Zhu J, Chen Z, Chen J, Deng W, Ding C, Zhao J (2026). BACKGROUND: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remains a highly lethal malignancy with limited effective treatments. Broadleaf Vetch (Vicia amoena, BV) is a traditional medicinal herb with potential anticancer properties, but its mechanisms in ESCC are not fully understood. METHODS: Network pharmacology was used to identify BV-related therapeutic targets and pathways. Molecular docking validated interactions between BV components and core proteins. In vitro assays evaluated proliferation, colony formation, migration, invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers, and ferroptosis-related indices. An ESCC xenograft model was used to assess antitumor efficacy in vivo. RESULTS: Five major BV components and 363 ESCC-related targets were identified, highlighting the PI3K-AKT pathway and key nodes such as EGFR, AKT1, SRC, TP53, and GPX4. BV significantly inhibited ESCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and reversed EMT marker expression. Ferroptosis induction was evidenced by significant Fe2+ accumulation, elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde levels, alongside glutathione depletion. BV treatment also precipitated mitochondrial dysfunction. In parallel, BV downregulated GPX4 and SLC7A11. Notably, these changes were largely reversed by the ferroptosis inhibitor Ferrostatin-1. In vivo, BV suppressed tumor growth and regulated EMT- and ferroptosis-associated proteins in xenograft tissues. CONCLUSIONS: BV exerts dual antitumor effects in ESCC by suppressing EMT and inducing ferroptosis. These findings suggest BV may represent a potential multi-target phytotherapeutic candidate for ESCC.",
    "Utilizing Tea Plant Synomones to Attract Encarsia smithi for Suppressing Aleurocanthus spiniferus in Tea Plantations.. Wu Y, Han S, Fan P, Ye H, Cheng Y, Liang Y, Zheng X, Lu J, Han B (2026). The citrus spiny whitefly, Aleurocanthus spiniferus Quaintance (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae), is an important pest of tea, Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze (Theales: Theaceae). Parasitic wasp, Encarsia smithi Silvestri (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae), is one of the dominant natural enemies of the whitefly. Generally, the whitefly produces four generations per year in Chinese tea plant growing areas. The wasp adult stages are basically synchronized with the nymphal stages of the whitefly. In an indoor Y-tube olfactometer bioassay, odors from both whitefly-pierced tea leaves and adjacent intact tea leaves significantly attracted the wasps, with elevated amounts of trans-2-hexenal and methyl salicylate (MeSA) detected from these two types of tea leaves. A four-arm olfactometer bioassay verified that these two compounds and their binary blends significantly attracted the wasps. Bud green sticky boards baited with trans-2-hexenal (10-2 g mL-1), MeSA (10-2 g mL-1), and five blends of trans-2-hexenal and MeSA (1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1 and 5:1, respectively, v/v) at 10-2 g mL-1 in hexane solutions captured significantly more wasps than did the un-baited boards, with the 3:1 blend catching the highest number of wasps. To enhance whitefly parasitism by the wasps, from early April to early August, the Attractant 2 lures (each holding a total mass of 80 mg of the 3:1 blend) were hung on tea branches and refreshed every 30 days. Deployment of the controlled release synomone-based attractant lures resulted in 2-3 fold higher parasitism rates by the wasps in the treated plots/sections than those in the CK plots/sections during both the peak periods of whitefly pupae of generation 2 from late July to early August and generation 3 in late August. This study demonstrated that herbivore-induced tea volatiles can be formulated as a synomone-based lure for controlling the whitefly through attracting E. smithi in tea plantations.",
    "Response of an Apex Mammalian Predator to an Emergence of 13-Year Periodical Cicadas.. Cypher BL (2026). Emergences of periodical cicadas constitute intense, short-duration resource pulses that can produce significant functional and numerical responses among insectivorous species that prey on them. The response of coyotes, apex predators in Illinois USA, to an emergence of 13-year periodical cicadas was investigated in 1989. Coyotes are not strongly insectivorous. However, during a 4-week period coinciding with peak emergence, cicadas were present in 85.9% of coyote scats (n = 71 scats) and 49% of scats contained only cicadas. Compared to the same time period in 1986-88 (n = 276 scats), use of all other food items was significantly lower in 1989 as was dietary diversity and overlap. This alteration in coyote foraging patterns constituted a strong functional response to the cicada emergence. The high abundance of cicadas combined with their ease of capture and consumption resulted in cicadas being an energetically efficient item for coyotes to forage upon. It is unknown whether other aspects of coyote life history (e.g., space use, activity patterns) also were affected or whether reduced predation pressure resulted in any effects on populations of their usual prey species.",
    "Dynamics and Health Risks of Fungal Bioaerosols in Confined Broiler Houses During Winter.. Yan M, Liu Z, Liu M, Liu H, Li Z, Yang Z, Lu Y, Feng W, Chen X, Cheng S, Yang Y, Zhang C, Wang X, Cui H (2026). Fungal bioaerosols play a critical ecological and health role in intensive poultry production systems. However, their dynamic characteristics and community succession patterns in confined cage environments during winter remain poorly understood. This study investigated a typical confined broiler house in Hebei Province, China, during winter. A combined approach of Andersen six-stage sampling, colony counting, and Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) high-throughput sequencing was employed to comprehensively analyze the concentration, particle size distribution, diversity, and community composition of fungal bioaerosols across three key growth stages: 7 days (brooding phase), 21 days (growing phase), and 35 days (finishing phase). The results revealed a significant increasing trend in fungal aerosol concentration as the rearing cycle progressed, increasing from 1125 ± 125 CFU/m3 at day 7 to 3872 ± 565 CFU/m3 at day 35 (p < 0.001), reaching high-risk exposure levels in the later stages. Small-sized fungal bioaerosols (<4.7 μm) were dominant across all stages (54.35-65.50%), with the highest proportion observed at day 21, indicating their potential for deep respiratory deposition and long-distance airborne transmission. The number of Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs), along with Chao1 and Shannon indices, increased significantly with bird age (p < 0.001), demonstrating a clear community succession from early-stage yeast-dominated forms (e.g., Diutina, Blumeria) to mid- and late-stage assemblages dominated by filamentous fungi (e.g., Aspergillus, Cladosporium, Alternaria). Notably, several zoonotic pathogenic genera were detected throughout all rearing stages, highlighting the potential risks of airborne fungi to animal health, occupational exposure, and environmental safety under winter ventilation restrictions. This study characterizes a stage-dependent pattern of increasing airborne fungal concentrations accompanied by shifts in particle size distribution and community composition under winter confined conditions. The findings provide a crucial scientific basis for optimizing winter ventilation and environmental management strategies, improving environmental control technologies, establishing airborne biosafety standards, and developing targeted fungal monitoring and prevention technologies.",
    "Olfactory Enrichment of Captive Pygmy Hippopotamuses with Applied Machine Learning.. Nielsen J, Gammelgård F, Lund SM, Præstekær ASB, Vinterberg Frandsen A, Strandqvist C, Nielsen MH, Olsen RN, Pagh S, Faddersbøll TL, Pertoldi C (2026). The pygmy hippopotamus (Choeropsis liberiensis, Morton, 1849) is classified as Endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Compared to other large, threatened mammals, this species remains relatively understudied and new findings indicate potential welfare concerns, emphasizing the need for further research on the species welfare in zoological institutions. One approach to improving welfare in captivity is through environmental enrichment. This study investigated the effects of olfactory enrichment on three individual pygmy hippopotamuses through behavioral analysis and heat-map visualization. Using continuous focal sampling, several behaviors were influenced by the stimuli, with results showing a general decrease in inactivity and an increase in environmental engagement and interaction, particularly through scenting behavior. To further enhance behavioral quantification, machine learning techniques were applied to video data, comparing manual and automated behavior classification using the pose estimation program SLEAP. Four behaviors Standing, Locomotion, Feeding/Foraging, and Lying Down were compared. A confusion matrix, time budgets, and Kendall's Coefficient of Concordance (W) were used to assess agreement between methods. The results showed a strong and moderate agreement between manual and automated annotations, for the female and calf, respectively. This demonstrates the potential of automation to complement behavioral observations in future welfare monitoring.",
    "Nest architecture and male aggression drive sexual isolation between three-spined stickleback ecotypes.. Smith C, Spence R, Szczerkowska-Majchrzak E, Żegota D, Zięba G (2026). To understand how sexual isolation contributes to the evolution of reproductive barriers, we examined the pre- and post-zygotic reproductive barriers between ecotypes of the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) from North Uist, where the species has undergone an adaptive radiation. Using an experimental design that separated the effects of ecotype, population of origin, and body size, we identified a pre-zygotic barrier attributed solely to ecotype; pairings within ecotypes were more likely to result in mating than those between ecotypes, regardless of population origin or relative body size of males and females. This effect was associated with reproductive incompatibilities linked to the failure of armoured females to enter the unusually small nests of armourless males, along with high levels of aggression from armoured males directed at armourless females. In vitro crosses did not reveal post-zygotic reproductive barriers associated with ecotype or population of origin. These findings indicate that sexual isolation, linked primarily to male traits and involving the coupling of barrier effects, is a significant obstacle to gene flow among the ecotypes, supporting an emerging view that pre-zygotic sexual isolation tends to evolve rapidly and at an early stage during ecological divergence.",
    "Global-best-guided electric eel foraging optimizer for robust parameter identification of Lorenz and memristive chaotic systems.. Izci D, Ekinci S, Ökten İ, Tümen V, Güneş BB, Rashdan M, Salman M (2026). Accurate parameter identification in chaotic dynamical systems constitutes a challenging inverse problem due to extreme sensitivity to initial conditions, pronounced nonlinearity, and highly multimodal error landscapes. To address these challenges, this study proposes a global-best-guided electric eel foraging optimization algorithm (g-EEFO), which enhances the original EEFO framework by embedding a behavior-aware and phase-dependent global learning mechanism. Unlike existing EEFO variants that rely solely on stochastic foraging dynamics, g-EEFO integrates global-best information as a soft cooperative signal that modulates the interacting, resting, hunting, and migrating behaviors without overriding them. In this way, global guidance acts as a directional bias rather than a dominant attractor, preserving ecological diversity while strengthening convergence coherence. For the first time, EEFO and its improved variant are applied to chaotic system parameter estimation. The proposed method is evaluated on two representative models: the classical Lorenz system and a structurally richer memristive chaotic system. Extensive numerical experiments, including statistical analysis, convergence profiling, boxplot distributions, and parameter-evolution trajectories, demonstrate the clear superiority of g-EEFO over several state-of-the-art metaheuristics. For the Lorenz system, g-EEFO achieves a best mean squared error of [Formula: see text], which is six to twenty orders of magnitude lower than competing methods, while maintaining an exceptionally small standard deviation ([Formula: see text]). For the memristive system, g-EEFO attains a best error of [Formula: see text], again outperforming all benchmarks by several orders of magnitude and exhibiting the highest run-to-run stability. In both cases, the estimated parameters match the true system values with near-perfect precision. These results confirm that the proposed behavior-aware global guidance fundamentally reshapes the search dynamics of EEFO, yielding substantial gains in convergence stability, numerical accuracy, and robustness. The g-EEFO therefore provides a powerful and reliable alternative for chaotic parameter identification and nonlinear system reconstruction across diverse dynamical regimes.",
    "A continuous artificial bee colony algorithm for solving uncapacitated facility location problems.. An M, Xiang W, Jiang Y, Gao M, Meng X (2026). Artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is one representative of many wellknown swarm intelligence methods for continuous optimization problems. However, it cannot directly solve discrete optimization problems without using complex transfer functions. Furthermore, the solutions quality and deviations obtained by many famous intelligent algorithms are still to be enhanced for solving uncapacitated facility location problems (UFLP). To this end, a continuous ABC called cABC is proposed for UFLP. In cABC, a chaotic initialization technique is employed to produce a good initial population in the range of [0,1), which enables cABC to evolve in continuous space. Then, a common probability discretizing mechanism is used to convert a continuous individual to a 0-1 vector, which enables cABC to solve UFLP. In addition, for infeasible solutions, a dynamic repair strategy is presented. Next, to enhance search performance of ABC, a random guiding mechanism is proposed. Subsequently, a time varying perturbation scheme is presented to share much more information between current individual and guiding individual. Next, a modified probability choice mechanism with random character is employed before entering onlooker bees phase. Last, an opposition based learning technique is employed to improve continuous nonupdating individual at the scout bees phase. To test effectiveness of cABC, it is first compared with traditional ABC on famous CAP dataset consisting of fifteen instances. To further validate superiority of cABC, it is compared with other eleven famous approaches on CAP dataset and M* dataset with twenty instances. Experimental results show that cABC surpasses other state-of-the-art methods in terms of solution accuracy and robustness.",
    "Asporin regulates glycolysis and stemness of gastric cancer cells.. Xu G, Cai Z, Zhuang Y, Wang H, Lin Q, Guo T, Tao H (2026). Asporin, a small leucine-rich proteoglycan encoded by the ASPN gene, is a vital player in cancer biology. Its oncogenic role in gastric cancer (GC) has been well-documented, particularly in promoting proliferation, apoptosis resistance, and migration/invasion. Nevertheless, ASPN's function in regulating glycolysis and stemness in GC cells remains underexplored. Here, we initially analyzed published transcriptomic datasets, confirming overexpression of ASPN in GC tissues compared with noncancerous stomach tissues. Furthermore, results from bioinformatics demonstrated that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) linked to ASPN expression regulate epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stemness-related pathways. Notably, ASPN expression predicted poor patient survival. Using ASPN-deficient HGC27 and GCIY GC cell lines, which express high ASPN levels, we conducted comprehensive cell biology assays. ASPN knockdown significantly impaired GC cell viability, reduced their migratory and invasive capacities, and increased apoptosis. We also observed that ASPN deficiency disrupted glycolysis and diminished the stemness of GC cells, reflected in reduced colony and sphere formation capacity and lower expression of stemness markers. Functionally, HIF1α overexpression partially rescued the deficits from ASPN loss, positioning HIF1α as a key downstream effector. To validate our in vitro findings, we employed a xenograft GC mouse model. Consistent with our in vitro data, ASPN-deficient GC cells displayed reduced tumor growth and stemness in vivo. In conclusion, our data suggest that ASPN is oncogenic in GC, enhancing proliferation, migration, invasion, glycolysis, and stemness while inhibiting apoptosis. These findings define a crucial oncogenic function of ASPN and underscore the therapeutic potential of targeting the ASPN-HIF1α axis in GC.",
    "A feedback regulatory loop by MAPK-CCA1 engages auxin signalling to stimulate root foraging for nitrate.. Zhang X, Zhou S, Guo J, Giehl RFH, Xu X, Yuan L, Zhang F, Bennett MJ, von Wirén N, Jia Z (2026). In eucaryotes, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades are evolutionarily conserved signalling modules crucial for growth regulation and stress tolerance. However, the regulatory role of MAPK in nutrient sensing by plants remains largely unclear. Here we uncovered MEKK14 and its paralogue MEKK13 determine lateral root elongation via enhanced cell division and expansion. We further fine-mapped a naturally occurring histidine-to-glutamine substitution in MEKK14 that weakens protein kinase activity and attenuates lateral root growth and response to nitrate (NO3-). We further demonstrate that NO3- transcriptionally upregulates MEKK13/14 depending on NLP7 to activate a MKK3-MPK1/2/7/14 signalling module. Downstream of this signalling cascade, the core oscillator of the circadian clock CCA1 is phosphorylated and stabilized to feedback induce MEKK13/14 expression and to activate auxin signalling-dependent lateral root foraging for NO3-. Our findings reveal a positive-feedback phosphorylation-transcriptional regulatory loop in root NO3- foraging, extending the regulatory function of MAPK signalling in the nutrient sensing.",
    "JAK/STAT1-interferon-ISGylation networks in breast cancer resistance to inhibitors of FOXM1 and CDK4/6.. Ziegler Y, Kumar S, Saeh CM, Plotner BN, Pento GO, Kim SH, Raghavan A, Schiff R, Katzenellenbogen JA, Katzenellenbogen BS (2026). The oncogenic transcription factor FOXM1 and the cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 all promote cancer progression and aggressiveness that can be suppressed initially by targeted inhibitors, but resistance almost always develops. We show that ER-positive breast cancer cells that acquire resistance to FOXM1 inhibitors (FOXM1i) or CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) exhibit some key similarities including an increased JAK/STAT-interferon-ISGylation signaling network with elevated ISG15 and ISG15 protein conjugates, but with differences in magnitudes and patterns of ISGylated proteins. All the resistant cell lines also express higher levels of enzymes critical for ISGylation which predict poorer survival outcomes in ER-positive breast cancer patients. Reduction of these proteins pharmacologically or by siRNA knockdown greatly impairs the viability, colony formation, and proliferation of the FOXM1i-resistant cells, with lesser impact on CDK4/6i resistant cells. Notably, CDK4/6i resistant cells and 3D-Matrigel cultures can still be growth inhibited by FOXM1i, and conversely the FOXM1i resistance can be overcome by palbociclib or abemaciclib, indicating that while the resistance mechanisms of these two classes of drugs have some similar features, they are sufficiently distinct so that sequential treatment approaches could be effective in supporting new options such as FOXM1 inhibitor use after progression on CDK4/6 inhibitors.",
    "Environmental enrichment enhances inter-individual variability in nest-building behavior in male mice.. Iwasaki M, Kurokawa S, Suzuki H, Nakamura AJ, Toyoda A (2026). Environmental enrichment (EE) affects brain function and behavior in laboratory animals. In this study, we investigated the behavioral and physiological effects of short-term EE exposure on male C57BL/6J mice. Juvenile mice were housed for 2 weeks under either EE or standard environment (SE) conditions, followed by a series of behavioral tests. Compared with SE mice, EE mice displayed greater variability in nest-building behavior, with some individuals exhibiting delayed initiation. In the open field test, EE mice spent significantly more time in the center zone, suggesting reduced anxiety-like behavior. In contrast, in the elevated plus maze test, EE mice spent less time in the open arms than SE mice. No significant group differences were observed in sucrose preference or tail suspension tests. Although body weight remained unchanged between the groups, EE mice exhibited significantly increased spleen weight and decreased epididymal fat weight, indicating modest physiological changes. These findings demonstrate that EE can enhance inter-individual behavioral diversity, particularly in goal-directed behaviors such as nest building, which emerged as a sensitive and ethologically relevant behavioral outcome for detecting environmental modulation and individual variability. This diversity may serve as a useful indicator for identifying depression-like phenotypes and understanding the vulnerabilities of EE-reared individuals.",
    "Antifungal repurposing of clinical chelator DMSA against Cryptococcus neoformans via laccase and histidine biosynthesis inhibition.. Zhang C, Peng M, Hu Q, Huang S, Zhang Q, Zhu J, Sang H, Kong Q (2026). As a globally distributed opportunistic fungus, Cryptococcus neoformans poses a significant threat to human health by causing fatal meningitis, which is associated with high mortality and morbidity rates. Current antifungals-polyenes, flucytosine, and azoles-are limited by toxicity and resistance, underscoring the need for new agents. This study evaluated dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), a chelating agent used in the treatment of heavy metal poisoning, beginning with its effect on the virulence factor laccase. DMSA showed broad-spectrum activity against standard (H99, B3501) and clinical isolate strains, with MIC values of 32-64 μg/mL. It inhibited laccase (IC50 = 43.98 μM; Km = 0.547 mM with levodopa) and impaired multiple virulence factors, including capsule formation (43.2% reduction in H99), urease activity (68.6% inhibition in H99 and 53.4% in B3501), as well as biofilm formation and its metabolic activity. In a Galleria mellonella infection model, although survival was not significantly improved, DMSA reduced fungal burden by 30% (P < 0.05), supported by histology and Colony-Forming Units (CFU) counts. Further transcriptomic and nutrient supplementation assays indicated that the antifungal action of DMSA is mediated through interference with histidine biosynthesis, suggesting a mechanism beyond laccase inhibition.",
    "Targeting cholinergic cells in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease: Validating a quadruple transgenic model.. Farkas S, Jasper V, Nyers-Marosi K, Petrovai B, Szabó A, Kvak EE, Sólyomvári C, Varga R, Kormos V, Makkai G, Ábrahám IM, Zelena D, Kovács T (2026). Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an increasing health and social problem worldwide with prevalent cholinergic cell involvement. To reveal the details of the exact mechanisms, further preclinical studies in animals are needed. Our aim was to create a mouse model that represents the progression of AD with easy cholinergic manipulation. The 3xTg-AD and ChAT-Cre strains were crossbred. After serial genotyping, a colony, homozygote for all four genes (PSEN1, APPSwe, tauP301L and Cre; 3xAD-ChAT-Cre) was established. The presence of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and phosphor-Tau (pTau) aggregates was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. To test the functionality of the Cre enzyme, a stimulating DREADD virus (AAV8-hSyn-DIO-hM3Dq-mCherry) was injected unilaterally into the nucleus basalis magnocellularis, and clozapine-N-oxide-induced c-Fos activation was compared between the two hemispheres. Behavioral characterization was performed using the Y-maze, social discrimination (SDT), single pellet reaching (SPR), fox odor (FOT), and splash tests (ST). Food, water consumption and body weight change were investigated. Immunostaining and RNAscope confirmed the expression of Cre in ChAT-positive cells and the progressive appearance of pathological hallmarks (Aβ and pTau). The c-Fos activity was significantly increased in the virus-injected hemisphere. Compared with control mice, 3xAD-ChAT-Cre mice showed decreased locomotion (Y-maze, SDT, FOT), increased anxiety (FOT, ST) and weaker fine motor skills (SPR). In conclusion, newly created animals have a functional Cre recombinase enzyme in cholinergic cells. Additionally, the animals presented the pathophysiological hallmarks of AD in specific brain areas and maintained the typical behavioral alterations previously reported in 3xTg-AD mice. Thus, this strain seems to be appropriate for further studies.",
    "Marine natural product-inspired 2-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoyl)quinazolin-4(3H)-one derivative CHNQD-01522: A novel anti-hepatocellular carcinoma agent targeting colchicine binding site of microtubule.. Li PJ, Wang CJ, Zhai RQ, Gao JX, Li HR, Liu JY, Wei MY, Gu YC, Shao CL (2026). Microtubule targeting agents are effective in cancer therapy, but current inhibitors face challenges including systemic toxicity and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) mediated drug resistance, underscoring the need for novel microtubule inhibitors. Quinazolin-4(3H)-one alkaloids, with diverse targets, exhibit significant potential for developing novel anti-cancer agents. Herein, inspired by marine quinazolin-4(3H)-one alkaloid penipanoid C, compounds 1‒55, a series of 2-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoyl)quinazolin-4(3H)-one derivatives were synthesized and identified. Among them, CHNQD-01522 (18) exhibited the strongest cytotoxic activity against Huh-7 and HepG2 cell lines with IC50 values of 0.19 and 0.17 μM. Meanwhile, treatment with CHNQD-01522 (18) suppressed tumor cell colony formation, arrested cell cycle in G2/M phases, and induced apoptosis. Mechanistic studies revealed that it is a novel microtubule inhibitor targeting the colchicine binding site, which cannot be transported by P-gp in cancer cells. Encouragingly, CHNQD-01522 (18) showed significant in vivo anti-tumor efficacy in the subcutaneous xenograft tumor model (TID, TGI = 79.09%) with frequency dependence. More importantly, the anti-tumor efficacy was also verified in an orthotopic xenograft tumor model. Furthermore, CHNQD-01522 (18) displayed satisfactory safety profiles in preliminary toxicity studies. Taken together, this study has identified a novel microtubule inhibitor with significant anti-hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) activity, inherent resistance-avoidance property, and a favorable safety profile, showing promise as an HCC therapeutic.",
    "Creative foraging and the explore-exploit trade-off in knowledge networks.. Kedrick K, Burhite K, Vilares I, Schrater PR (2026). The scope of knowledge is constantly evolving, due to such factors as environmental changes, cultural evolution, and scientific discovery. Consequently, we are frequently confronted with gaps in our knowledge, compelling us to seek information from available sources. Sometimes the information we seek is easy to find; other times it has yet to be established by others, requiring us to creatively come up with an original perspective. Yet, little is known about how our foraging strategies change depending on the ease with which the information we seek is readily available. We investigated how the need to generate new ideas influences the rate at which individuals explore or exploit existing information. Participants (N=138) answered questions either fully answerable (low-creativity condition) or not fully answerable (high-creativity condition) with information they foraged for on Wikipedia. We created knowledge networks from the foraged information, wherein Wikipedia pages were nodes. The edges linked pairs of Wikipedia pages when they were visited by the participant either sequentially or within the same condition, and were weighted based on the semantic similarity between the pair of pages. This approach allowed us to measure exploration (jumping between disparate pages) and exploitation (viewing closely related pages). In the high-creativity condition, participants were more likely to trade-off between exploration (lower average edge weights) and exploitation (higher average clustering coefficients). This trade-off was associated with responses that were more novel, diverging further from the Wikipedia text, compared to less novel responses. These findings reveal how foraging strategies differ in creative versus non-creative contexts, and provide insight into the processes that underlie learning and scientific discovery.",
    "Constructed value of information with iterative scoring and parametric uncertainty to identify management-relevant research priorities for a declining raptor species.. Davis KP, Eaton MJ, Bjerre ER, White HM, Boal CW, Herner-Thogmartin JH, Robinson OJ, Lawson AJ (2026). Constructed value of information (CVoI) is an expert elicitation decision-analytic tool used to prioritize sources of uncertainty based on their potential to improve decision outcomes if resolved. Despite increased application of CVoI, the robustness of CVoI prioritization of sources of uncertainty relative to differences in expert elicitation and scoring methods has not been evaluated. We engaged a group of species experts in a decision-analytic process to elicit uncertainties, framed as alternative hypotheses, about current population declines of the American kestrel (Falco sparverius) in the United States. Participants scored 13 hypotheses across 3 CVoI criteria, which are defined as constructed scales. Rather than experts selecting a single score per criterion, we used a likelihood point method to incorporate parametric uncertainty in the scoring process, in which experts were given 100 points to distribute across possible score categories within the criterion-specific constructed scale. Experts provided scores over 2 scoring rounds, with an opportunity to review and discuss initial scores between rounds. We used a Shannon entropy calculation to quantify how evenly participants allotted their points. We used simulation to evaluate the robustness of our prioritization results relative to a scoring method in which participants selected a single score category for each criterion. Participants often spread their points across 2 adjacent scores, reflecting parametric uncertainty. For one third of the hypothesis-scoring round combinations, the prioritization results differed in approximately 50% of simulations. The highest scoring hypotheses related to how the use of artificial versus natural nest cavities affects fecundity or survival, whether winter roosting sites are a limiting factor for population growth, and whether gamebird habitat management may benefit kestrel populations. Our CVoI prioritization framework can be used to develop collaborative research that is directly relevant to a management decision and is an advance in eliciting more representative expert beliefs. Valor construido de la información con puntajes iterativos e incertidumbre paramétrica para identificar las prioridades relevantes para la gestión de una especie de rapaz en declive Resumen El valor construido de la información (VCI) es una herramienta analítica de decisión basada en la opinión de expertos que se utiliza para priorizar las fuentes de incertidumbre en función de su potencial para mejorar los resultados de las decisiones si se resuelven. A pesar del aumento de la aplicación del VCI, no se ha evaluado la solidez de la priorización del VCI de las fuentes de incertidumbre en relación con las diferencias en los métodos de obtención de opiniones de expertos y de puntuación. Involucramos a un grupo de expertos en especies en un proceso de análisis de decisiones para obtener incertidumbres, enmarcadas como hipótesis alternativas, sobre la actual disminución de la población del cernícalo americano (Falco sparverius) en los Estados Unidos. Los participantes evaluaron 13 hipótesis según tres criterios VCI, que se definen como escalas construidas. En lugar de que los expertos seleccionaran una única puntuación por criterio, utilizamos un método de puntos de probabilidad para incorporar la incertidumbre paramétrica en el proceso de puntuación, en el que se asignó a los expertos 100 puntos para distribuir entre las posibles categorías de puntuación dentro de la escala construida específica para cada criterio. Los expertos proporcionaron puntuaciones durante dos rondas, con la oportunidad de revisar y discutir las puntuaciones iniciales entre rondas. Utilizamos un cálculo de entropía de Shannon para cuantificar la uniformidad con la que los participantes asignaron sus puntos. Utilizamos la simulación para evaluar la solidez de nuestros resultados de priorización en relación con un método de puntuación en el que los participantes seleccionaron una única categoría de puntuación para cada criterio. Los participantes a menudo distribuyeron sus puntos entre dos puntuaciones adyacentes, lo que refleja la incertidumbre paramétrica. En un tercio de las combinaciones de rondas de evaluación de hipótesis, los resultados de la priorización difirieron en aproximadamente el 50% de las simulaciones. Las hipótesis con puntuaciones más altas se referían a los efectos sobre la fecundidad o la supervivencia del uso de cavidades de nidos artificiales frente a naturales, los lugares de descanso invernal como factor limitante del crecimiento de la población y los beneficios para las poblaciones de cernícalos de la gestión del hábitat de las especies de aves de caza. Nuestro marco de priorización VCI puede utilizarse para desarrollar investigaciones colaborativas que sean directamente relevantes para una decisión de gestión y supone un avance en la obtención de opiniones de expertos más representativas. 构建信息价值(constructed value of information, CVoI)是一种专家征询决策分析工具, 通过评估消除各种不确定性来源对决策结果的潜在改进效果, 来对不确定性来源进行优先级排序。尽管CVoI应用已日益广泛, 但其对不确定性来源的优先级排序在专家征询与评分方法差异中的稳健性尚未得到评估。我们召集了一群物种研究专家来开展决策分析, 通过构建替代假说框架来获得美洲隼(Falco sparverius)在美国当前种群数量下降情况的不确定性信息。参与者依据三项CVoI标准对13个假说进行评分, 这些标准均采用构建量表形式。我们采用似然点的方法, 替代了专家针对每个标准单次评分的模式, 将参数不确定性纳入了评分过程, 即专家在特定标准所构建的量表范围内, 将100分分配至各个可能的评分类别中。专家分两轮提交评分, 并在两轮之间可回顾和讨论初始评分。我们运用香农熵计算来量化参与者评分分布的均匀性, 通过模拟来评估我们的优先排序结果相对于“单一评分方法”的稳健性, 后者要求参与者为每个标准选择单一的评分类别。结果显示, 参与者常将评分分散于两个相邻分数区间, 反映出参数不确定性。在三分之一的假说‐评分轮次组合中, 约50%的模拟存在优先排序结果的差异。得分最高的假说涉及人工巢穴与天然巢穴对繁殖力或存活率的影响, 越冬栖息地作为种群增长限制因素的作用, 以及猎禽物种栖息地管理对美洲隼种群的益处。本研究的CVoI优先排序框架可用于设计直接与管理决策相关的合作研究, 在获取更具代表性的专家征询信息方面取得了进展。【翻译:胡怡思;审校:聂永刚】.",
    "Sex, density dependence, and urbanization level shape host infection by an obligate endoparasite.. MacIvor JS, Hall TCK (2026). Anthropogenic changes alter host-parasite dynamics, but the way urbanization influences these relationships remains understudied, despite the diversity in species and transmission modes. We investigated infection of the solitary wasp Isodontia mexicana Saussure, 1867 (Hymenoptera: Sphecidae) by the twisted-wing insect Eupathocera auripedis Pierce, 1911 (Strepsiptera: Xenidae), a rarely documented obligate endoparasite, over a three-year period. We recorded 40 stylopized I. mexicana individuals out of 321 wasps examined, totaling 69 individual E. auripedis, including six found embedded in a single host. Female wasps were larger than males and showed no change in body size with stylopization, whereas stylopized males were significantly smaller than their non-stylopized counterparts. We observed density dependence between host and parasite: wasp abundance, stylopization rates, and the number of strepsipterans per host were all positively correlated. All variables declined significantly along a gradient from low to high urbanization, with tree cover the most important determinant for nesting habitat quality. Although open green space was not directly associated with host or parasite variables, it remains important for I. mexicana, which depends on these areas for tree crickets (Oecanthus spp.) to provision offspring and nectar from asters and mints. Thus, while nesting may be more dependent on forested areas, these highly mobile wasps likely rely on open green spaces for foraging which may serve as interception points for parasites. Further research is needed to better understand the influence of land cover on host-parasite interactions. Our findings highlight the utility of trap nests for improving the study of cryptic interactions, the use of stylopization as a bioindicator, and new insights into urban strepsipteran ecology.",
    "Target switching in 2D and 3D visual foraging reveals trade-offs between mental effort, travelling distance and movement speed.. Orun E, Green RJ, De Lillo C (2026). Many everyday activities entail searching for multiple desired items and can be conceptualised as foraging. They require mental effort to keep each item in memory, while searching. An instantiation of such activities in experimental psychology is visual foraging, where people search for multiple target categories among distractors. In visual foraging, high frequencies of switching between selections of two different target categories suggest the use of mentally effortful strategies, which require sustained simultaneous use of working memory templates for each of them. As humans often strive to reduce mental effort in cognitive tasks, a key theoretical issue is the characterisation of what induces people to spontaneously increase the frequency of switching between target categories. In five experiments, we systematically manipulated variables in instances of foraging in 2D and 3D virtual reality environments to assess changes in target switching frequency and its determinants. Experiment 1 showed that humans switch more when foraging in large immersive navigational environments, than in visual arrays seen from a bird's eye view. Further experiments clarified that: 1) inter-target distance and movement speed are the critical determinants of strategy changes in a 2D small-scale environment; 2) distance affects the frequency of switching more than speed, in a 3D navigational environment. These results indicate that people spontaneously choose to endure mental costs to meet the demands of different naturalistic instances of foraging. They support theories postulating a flexible use of working memory templates.",
    "No evidence that haplodiploidy favors the evolution of eusociality.. Bonifacii R, Bell-Roberts L, Grafen A, West S (2026). The potential role of haplodiploid sex determination in promoting the evolution of altruism and eusociality has been the subject of intense debate for over 50 y. Different theoretical models have suggested that haplodiploidy influences relatedness in a way that either does or does not make it easier for altruism to evolve. This debate over the \"haplodiploidy hypothesis\" can only be resolved with a decisive empirical test that controls for potential phylogenetic bias. Here we critically examine the current state of evidence for an adaptive link between haplodiploidy and eusociality, applying phylogenetically informed methods to ensure that statistical tests reflect independent evolutionary transitions. Using data from 5,678 species, across all major insect orders, we find no evidence that haplodiploidy favors an increased rate of eusocial evolution. We show that this result is robust to: a) different analytical approaches; b) alternative ways of defining both eusociality and haplodiploidy; and c) uncertainty in eusociality assignments. Our analyses suggest that previously reported associations between haplodiploidy and eusociality are likely to have been artifacts, false-positive results primarily driven by a high transition rate to eusociality within the Hymenoptera. This high transition rate could be explained by any factor associated with that group, such as parental care, monogamy, or the possession of a powerful sting.",
    "Carbon and Nitrogen Stable Isotopic Discrimination Factors Between Diet and Feces in Wild Giant Pandas.. Long G, Wu Y, Huang L, Nie Y, Han H (2026). Stable isotope analysis is very useful for studying animal nutritional ecology. Feces are the most accessible and non-invasive samples for short-term dietary reconstruction. The giant panda is a special Carnivora species with a highly specialized diet. However, no relevant research has yet explored the reliability of fecal isotopes in wild giant pandas, and the key parameter-fecal isotopic discrimination factors-remains unreported. Thus, we analyzed carbon and nitrogen isotopes of different bamboo species and parts with associated pandas' feces collected from their foraging sites. The results showed carbon isotopes of shoots were more positive than those of leaves, and the isotopic composition of their feces can effectively reflect seasonal dietary shifts. The calculated fecal carbon discrimination factor was close to zero (Δ13Cdiet-feces = 0.6 ± 0.8‱), while the nitrogen DFs were significantly positive (Δ15Ndiet-feces = 2.1 ± 1.2‱). The typical metabolic pattern, physiological adaptations and distinctive microbiota of giant pandas contribute to the unique DFs different from those of other herbivores. These findings provide valuable short-term dietary records, key parameters for the application of fecal isotopes to interpret foraging strategies and nutritional status for an endangered species in the wild, expand the application of stable isotope methods in studies to specialized diet animals, and offer a reference for studies utilizing non-invasive materials in other mammals.",
    "Dual Effect of EZH2 Gene Editing with CRISPR/Cas9 in Lung Cancer.. Menezes JM, de Mello DC, Saito KC, Kimura ET, Fuziwara CS (2026). Lung adenocarcinoma is the most common form of lung cancer with a 5-year survival rate of 15%, largely due to asymptomatic metastasis and late diagnosis. Overexpression of Polycomb group (PcG) proteins, particularly EZH2, the catalytic component of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), has been associated with the pathogenesis of lung cancer, frequently showing correlation with cancer progression and poor prognosis. In this study, EZH2 levels were modulated by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing and PRC2 activity was inhibited with EZH2 inhibitor EPZ6438 or EED inhibitor MAK683. EZH2 gene editing reduced cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and colony formation and reduced NFκ-B signaling activation, indicating an antitumoral effect in vitro. Moreover, EZH2 inhibition also increased the expression of differentiation-related genes, such as GATA5, FOXA2, and lung surfactants, indicating a pro-differentiation effect. However, EZH2-edited cells injected into an immunocompromised mouse model generated larger tumors compared to unedited cells. This was accompanied by increased expression of other PcG genes, including EZH1, CBX2, RING1, EED, and SUZ12, suggesting a compensatory interaction between PRC2 and PRC1 complexes. These findings provide significant clinical relevance, both in elucidating the mechanisms of novel molecular targets and in guiding treatment strategies for lung cancer when using epigenetic inhibitors.",
    "Multiscale Nest-Site Selection of Burrowing Owl (Athene cunicularia) in Chihuahuan Desert Grasslands.. Ruiz Aymá G, Olalla Kerstupp A, Gómez Govea MA, Guzmán Velasco A, González Rojas JI (2026). Nest-site selection in birds is a hierarchical process shaped by environmental filters operating across multiple spatial scales. In species that depend on burrows excavated by ecosystem engineers, understanding how these filters interact is essential for effective conservation. We evaluated nest-site selection by the Burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia) within colonies of the Mexican prairie dog (Cynomys mexicanus) in the southern Chihuahuan Desert using a multiscale analytical framework spanning burrow, site, colony, and landscape levels. During the 2010 and 2011 breeding seasons, we located 56 successful nests and paired each with an inactive non-nest burrow within the same colony. Eighteen structural and environmental variables were measured and analyzed using binary logistic regression models, with model selection based on an information-theoretic approach (AICc) and prior screening for predictor collinearity. Nest-site selection was associated with greater internal burrow development and reduced external exposure at the burrow scale, proximity to satellite burrows and low-to-moderate vegetation structure at the site scale, higher densities of active prairie dog burrows at the colony scale, and reduced predation risk and agricultural disturbance at the landscape scale. The integrated multiscale model showed substantially greater support and discriminatory power than single-scale models, indicating that nest-site selection emerges from interactions among spatial scales rather than from isolated factors. These findings support hierarchical habitat-selection theory and underscore the importance of conserving functional Mexican prairie dog colonies and low-disturbance grassland landscapes to maintain suitable breeding habitats for Burrowing owls in the southern Chihuahuan Desert.",
    "De Novo Genome Assembly, Genomic Features, and Comparative Analysis of the Sawfly Dentathalia scutellariae.. Wang S, Liu C, Mei Y, Yang D, Pang H, Wang F, Ye G, Fang Q, Ye X, Yang Y (2026). Dentathalia scutellariae (Hymenoptera: Athaliidae) is a major pest of Scutellaria baicalensis, a plant of significant economic and medicinal value. To date, no genomic resources have been available for this species, limiting research into its biology and control. Here, we reported a genome assembly of D. scutellariae with high accuracy and contiguity, sequenced by PacBio HiFi long-read and MGI-Seq short-read methods. The genome assembly is 157.00 Mb in length with a contig N50 of 4.04 Mb. The complete BUSCO score was 98.8%. The genome contained 14.73 Mb of repetitive elements, representing 9.38% of the total genome size. We predicted 14,904 protein-coding genes, of which 12,327 genes were annotated functionally. Gene family analysis of D. scutellariae revealed 422 expanded and 113 contracted gene families. Notably, genes within expanded families were significantly enriched in retinol metabolism and drug metabolism-cytochrome P450 pathways. We present the first high-quality genome assembly of D. scutellariae, which serves as a foundational genomic resource. This dataset will facilitate future studies on the molecular basis of D. scutellariae's pest status, host adaptation, and the development of targeted control strategies.",
    "Effects of N-Acetylcysteine and Alpha-Ketoglutarate on OVCAR3 Ovarian Cancer Cells: Insights from Integrative Bioinformatics and Experimental Validation.. Khamineh Y, Panahi-Alanagh S, Zolghadri S, Mavaddatiyan L, Ryszkiel I, Stanek A, Talkhabi M (2026). Ovarian cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality among women, underscoring the need for novel combination strategies that effectively inhibit tumor cell growth while limiting adverse effects. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG) are biologically active compounds with reported anticancer properties; however, their combined effects in ovarian cancer are not well characterized. In this study, we applied an integrative approach combining network pharmacology analysis with in vitro experiments to investigate the effects of NAC and AKG on OVCAR3 ovarian cancer cells. Common molecular targets of NAC and AKG were identified by intersecting predicted compound targets with ovarian cancer-associated genes, followed by protein-protein interaction network construction and Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analyses. Experimental validation assessed the effects of NAC and AKG, alone and in combination, on cell viability, apoptosis, migration, and clonogenic capacity. Network analysis identified 70 shared target genes enriched in pathways related to apoptosis, cellular stress responses, and cell migration. In vitro experiments demonstrated that combined treatment with NAC (10 mM) and AKG (100 µM) significantly reduced cell viability, increased apoptotic cell death, and markedly suppressed cell migration and colony formation compared with single-agent treatments. Overall, these findings indicate that the combination of NAC and AKG exerts enhanced inhibitory effects on ovarian cancer cell growth and motility in vitro.",
    "Effect of the G-Protein-Coupled Receptor T2R14 on Proliferation and Cell Population Growth in Oral Cancer Cells.. Chen Y, Kella M, Austin K, Bhullar RP, Chelikani P (2026). Oral cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths and significantly affects the quality of life of patients. However, many of its mechanisms remain unclear, and its treatment needs improvement. The G-protein-coupled receptor taste receptor type 2 member 14 (T2R14 or TAS2R14) is expressed in various cancer types. However, few studies have investigated its roles in oral cancer, and its effects on oral cancer cell proliferation and growth are unknown. This study aimed to examine T2R14's impact on proliferation and cell population growth (CPG) of oral cancer cells. TAS2R14 gene knockout was performed, and cell numbers, cell viability, and colony formation were measured. This study showed that TAS2R14 knockout in oral cancer cells significantly decreased calcium mobilization, increased cell numbers, colony formation, the proliferation marker proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and the phosphorylation of mechanistic target of rapamycin, but did not affect cell viability. These observations are consistent with the clinical data that higher TAS2R14 mRNA expression is associated with better survival of patients with oral cancer. Therefore, T2R14 downregulation increased oral cancer CPG, suggesting a tumor-suppressor-like role. The study's findings could improve our understanding of T2R14 mechanisms and help develop strategies to advance oral cancer treatment by targeting T2R14.",
    "Zinc Deficiency Disrupts Germ Cell Nest Breakdown During In Vitro Ovary Culture.. Hester JM, Getman SM, Pepling ME, Diaz FJ (2026). In mammals, the size of the non-renewable primordial follicle pool is established before or soon after birth. Primordial follicles, each composed of a single oocyte surrounded by somatic cells, are the only source of gametes during the entire reproductive lifespan of the female. The size of the initial follicle pool is a key component in determining reproductive longevity, and impaired follicle assembly has severe consequences for fertility. Here, we evaluate the effect of zinc deficiency on germ cell survival and follicle activation in late pregnancy and early postnatally using in vitro organ culture of mouse ovaries. Zinc deficiency did not affect apoptosis, germ cell number, and gene expression in fetal ovaries. Germ cell nest breakdown, which occurs in the newborn mouse ovary, involves invasion of germ cell cysts by somatic cells to form primordial follicles was disrupted by zinc deficiency leading to fewer oocytes enclosed in follicles (p = 0.002). Gene expression of both an oocyte-specific factor (Bmp15) and granulosa cell-specific factor (Foxl2) shown to regulate nest breakdown was decreased by zinc deficiency (p < 0.05). There was also a strong trend toward fewer activated growing follicles after zinc-deficient culture of newborn ovaries (p = 0.051). The initial wave of follicle activation is key for both paracrine and endocrine signaling from the ovary. Disruption of this process, as well as impaired primordial follicle formation, may impact subsequent fertility.",
    "MTG2 as a Causal and Druggable Target in Uveal Melanoma via Mitochondrial DNA Dynamics: Evidence From Functional Validation and DMSA Identification.. Zhang Y, Min D, Wang Y, Yu W, Cui B, Su Y, Shen Z, Feng C (2026). PURPOSE: Mitochondrial dysfunction is increasingly recognized as a pivotal factor in cancer pathogenesis. We thus explored the causal role of mitochondrial-related genes (MRGs) in uveal melanoma (UM) and the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: We performed Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using 1693 cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTLs) of MRGs as instrumental variables and genome-wide association data (GWAS) of UM. Colocalization analysis assessed whether gene expression and UM risk shared a common causal variant. Further, mediation MR and in vitro functional assays were used to validate key findings and explore their biological relevance. A molecular docking-based virtual screening strategy, followed by experimental validation, was used to identify potential therapeutic compounds. RESULTS: MR analysis identified 57 MRGs significantly associated with UM risk after Bonferroni correction (P < 0.05/1693). Among them, MTG2 or GTPBP5, encoding a mitochondrial ribosome-associated GTPase, showed strong colocalization with UM susceptibility (PP.H4 = 75%). Silencing MTG2 in UM cell lines induced PARP cleavage and markedly suppressed cell proliferation and colony formation. Mediation analysis revealed that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) heteroplasmy at chrM:567 (A:ACCCCCC) partially mediates MTG2's effect on UM (4%). Moreover, both genetically driven analysis and qPCR confirmed a positive association between MTG2 expression and mtDNA copy number. Notably, dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), identified as a potential MTG2 inhibitor, reduced MTG2 levels and promoted apoptosis in UM cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our integrative genomic and experimental approach uncovers MTG2 as a causal contributor to UM pathogenesis, potentially through modulation of mtDNA heteroplasmy and copy number. DMSA emerges as a promising therapeutic agent targeting mitochondrial dysregulation in UM.",
    "Population genetics and ecological niche modeling of Diglyphus albiscapus (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) in China.. Wan WJ, Jin ZA, Du SJ, Ye FY, Guo JY, Liu WX (2026). The effects of global climate change on the biocontrol of agricultural pests remain unclear. Understanding the geographical distribution and genetic differentiation of parasitoid wasps in past and current environments can help predict how the future environment will affect these wasps. Diglyphus albiscapus (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) is a dominant parasitoid wasp of agromyzid leaf miners. Our study analyzed the intraspecific diversity, population structure, and historical population dynamics of D. albiscapus based on cytochrome c oxidase subunit I and internal transcribed spacer II genes. The current and future potential geographical distributions (PGD) of D. albiscapus in China were predicted using an ensemble model. Although the genetic diversity of D. albiscapus in China was relatively high, its genetic variation was relatively low. The fixation indices (FST) and gene flow (Nm) for the D. albiscapus population were 0.09823 and 2.29505, respectively, indicating that interpopulation gene exchange was adequate. The effective population size of D. albiscapus expanded approximately twofold during the early stadial of the last glacial period (MIS 4), and 3 populations expanded substantially. Currently, this species occurs mainly in northeast, northwest, and southern China. The PGD of D. albiscapus would be expected to spread outward from its current potential distribution range under global climate change. The predicted results of population genetics and PGD showed that anthropogenic activities may have promoted the spread of D. albiscapus, enhancing gene exchange within the species and reducing genetic differentiation. This study provided a reference for the conservation and application of D. albiscapus in the field.",
    "Treatment of dental implant surfaces with graphene oxide nanoparticles: Synthesis, characterization, and assessment of antimicrobial potential.. Lima R, Neves JG, Navarro da Rocha D, Prado da Silva MH, Hirata MC, Menezes L, Martinelli Franco E, Correr-Sobrinho L, Costa AR (2026). This study assesses the synthesis and characterization of titanium implant surface nanocoating with graphene oxide (GO) at varying concentrations. Nanocoatings were applied using the dip coating technique, and GO nanoparticles were synthesized chemically. Physicochemical, morphological, and biological characterizations were conducted using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy, in vitro bioactivity assay, cell viability, and colony-forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL). Cell viability data were subjected to two-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey's test (α = 0.05). CFU/mL data were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by Dunn's test (α = 0.05). TEM revealed a sheet-like structure of GO nanoparticles. SEM showed the roughness of the nanocoated titanium surface. Raman spectroscopy indicated the presence of GO on the titanium surface, as evidenced by D and G bands. Higher apatite crystal deposition was observed on surfaces with greater GO concentrations at 7 and 14 days (bioactivity assay). The highest percentage of cell viability was noted in the 1.5% GO group after 48 h, compared to other groups at different time points (p < 0.05). Surface treatment with varying GO concentrations induced greater cell viability compared to the acidic treatment (p < 0.05). The 1.5% GO group showed the lowest antibacterial efficacy, as evidenced by the highest CFU/mL values (p < 0.05). GO particles remained stable and chemically unchanged during the coating process. The GO-coated titanium surfaces showed no cytotoxicity and exhibited notable bioactive and antibacterial effects against Streptococcus mutans. These findings suggest that GO coatings may effectively enhance the biological and antimicrobial performance of titanium implants.",
    "Association between Oral Streptococcus Mutans Counts and Proteinuria in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease: A Pilot Study Using Chlorhexidine.. Misaki T, Suehiro Y, Naka S, Matsuoka D, Suehara K, Ito S, Nagasawa Y, Okawa R, Nomura R, Matsumoto-Nakano M, Nakano K (2026). INTRODUCTION: Chlorhexidine mouthwash is one of the most widely used anti-microbial agents, reducing oral cavity bacterial load. However, the effects of mouthwash on systemic conditions in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) remain unknown. We examined the relationship between Streptococcus mutans abundance in the oral cavity and proteinuria in patients with CKD. METHODS: Patients with CKD (n = 57) gargled with mouthwash containing chlorhexidine gluconate three times daily for 1 year. We prospectively investigated the relationship between changes in the number of S. mutans and proteinuria. RESULTS: The number of S. mutans colony-forming units (CFU) ≥103/mL saliva at month 0 was significantly associated with higher urinary proteinuria and S. mutans CFU/mL over time. The mean number of S. mutans in all patients decreased significantly after 12 months. Proteinuria also decreased significantly after 12 months compared with after 6 months. The rate of proteinuria <0.3 g/g creatinine after 12 months was significantly higher in the group that had <103 CFU/mL S. mutans after 12 months than in other groups. CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study, a potential association was observed between oral S. mutans counts and proteinuria in patients with CKD. Larger studies are needed to clarify this relationship.",
    "Targeting HIF-2α in Colorectal Cancer Reveals a Cholesterol Biosynthesis-Dependent Ferroptotic Vulnerability.. Dalal PJ, Singhal R, Hu B, Stark D, Rossiter N, Jain C, Sajjakulnukit P, Lyssiotis CA, Shah YM (2026). Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) remains a major cause of cancer-related mortality, with rising incidence in individuals under 55, highlighting the need for novel therapeutic strategies. Hypoxia-inducible factor 2 alpha (HIF-2α) has been genetically validated as a critical driver of colorectal tumorigenesis, with intestinal epithelium-specific deletion in mice markedly reducing tumor formation. While selective HIF-2α inhibitors such as PT2385 are FDA-approved for renal cell carcinoma, pharmacologic HIF-2α inhibition has not been explored in CRC. Here, we demonstrate that HIF-2α inhibition alone fails to suppress CRC growth in vitro under normoxic or hypoxic conditions and in xenograft models in vivo. To identify vulnerabilities induced by HIF-2α blockade, we performed an unbiased CRISPR metabolic screen, revealing cholesterol biosynthesis as a critical dependency. Targeting this pathway with clinically approved statins (atorvastatin, pitavastatin, simvastatin) synergized with PT2385 to suppress CRC cell growth, reduce colony formation, and enhance cell death. Mechanistic studies show that combined HIF-2α and HMG-CoA reductase inhibition promotes ferroptosis, characterized by increased lipid peroxidation and depletion of antioxidant metabolites. These effects are fully reversed by the ferroptosis inhibitor liproxstatin-1. Genetic knockdown of HIF-2α or HMG-CoA reductase recapitulated the enhanced sensitivity to combination therapy. In vivo, co-administration of PT2385 and atorvastatin significantly reduced tumor growth and increased ferroptotic cell death in xenografts, confirming the mechanistic link. Collectively, these findings uncover a metabolic vulnerability of CRC to dual HIF-2α and cholesterol biosynthesis inhibition, supporting a clinically actionable strategy that leverages safe, FDA-approved statins to potentiate HIF-2α-targeted therapy.",
    "Evidence for natural selection shaping the evolution of collective behavior among global Caenorhabditis elegans populations.. Kang YJ, Costa AC, Greenway R, Shrestha P, Pertzelan A, Brown AE, Ding SS (2026). Animal behavior can diverge in natural populations in response to different environmental conditions, but if and how natural selection also shapes the evolution of collective behavior in groups of animals remains underexplored. With their cosmopolitan distribution and known collective behaviours, wild populations of Caenorhabditis elegans provide a powerful system to address how collective behavior could evolve across natural habitats on a global scale. We screened a panel of 196 genetically diverse C. elegans strains sampled from around the world, conducting aggregation behavior experiments and analysis to quantify natural variation among these populations. We found substantial variation in the spatial magnitude and the temporal dynamics of aggregation across strains, which were significantly explained by the elevation of the source habitats. Accounting for neutral evolutionary processes, our maximum likelihood population effects (MLPE) models further support a role of selection on aggregation. Furthermore, the two behavioral traits are highly heritable, and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) revealed a quantitative trait locus (QTL) containing several candidate genes associated with oxygen response and foraging behaviors. Our results showcase C. elegans aggregation as a collective behavior that has diverged globally across elevational gradients, and support that natural selection has shaped the evolution of this collective behavior.",
    "Disorganized Inhibitory Dynamics in Hippocampal area CA1 of 22q11.2 Deletion Mutant Mice.. Herrlinger SA, Rao BY, Conde Paredes ME, Tuttman AL, Arain H, Varol E, Gogos JA, Losonczy A (2026). Individuals with the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, one of the strongest genetic risk factors for schizophrenia, demonstrate cognitive impairments, including episodic memory dysfunction. Place cell activity of excitatory pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus supporting episodic memory is impaired in a mouse model for the 22q11.2 deletion ( Df(16)A +/- ). While excitatory dynamics are under tight inhibitory control by multiple subtypes of GABAergic interneurons, previous studies have predominantly focused on a single subtype of PV-expressing interneurons; there have not yet been studies describing the functional relationships between molecularly identified inhibitory types in Df(16)A +/- mice. Here, we examined interneuron subtype-specific activity dynamics in the dorsal hippocampal area CA1 of Df(16)A +/- mice during random foraging and spatial reward navigation tasks. Capitalizing on 3D acousto-optical deflector two-photon microscopy with post hoc immunohistochemical identification, we found that multiple interneuron types exhibit aberrant responses to reward locations and delayed reward enrichment extinction. Df(16)A +/- inhibitory interneurons also carry markedly reduced spatial information in a subtype-dependent manner. We observed task-dependent changes in the correlation structure and coactivity among multiple GABAergic subtypes, suggesting a broadly disorganized microcircuit functionality in mutant mice. Overall, we identify widespread and heterogeneous subtype-specific alterations in interneuron dynamics during spatial reward navigation, reflecting impaired flexibility and organization in CA1 inhibitory microcircuits. Our study provides critical insights into how schizophrenia-risk mutations affect local-circuit interactions among diverse cell types in the mouse hippocampus during learning and spatial navigation.",
    "Gaussian Process Inference Reveals Non-separability of Position and Velocity Tuning in Grid Cells.. Warton LJ, Ganguli S, Giocomo LM (2026). Grid cells in medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) support spatial navigation by responding to multiple variables, including position, speed, and head direction. While tuning curves for each of these variables has been examined individually at the level of single-cells, less is known about the conjunctive coding of grid cells for these properties. To investigate this, we analyzed neural recordings of freely foraging rats and constructed four-dimensional (4D) tuning curves across 2D position and 2D velocity. In order to combat the sparse sampling of such a large behavioral space, we applied Gaussian Process (GP) methods to estimate firing rate at un-sampled points. Comparison GP model-derived tuning curves to those predicted by a fully separable model revealed that some cells exhibited significant non-separability of position and velocity tuning, and suggested a data coverage threshold necessary to observe this non-separability. In summary, our use of GPs allowed us to distinguish interactions in position-velocity tuning across a 4D behavioral space that have not been apparent in 2D analyses.",
    "Maternal Obesity Reprograms Differentiation Trajectories of Fetal Hematopoietic Stem and Progenitor Cells Through Altered Inflammatory Signaling.. Doratt BM, Hemati H, Wagner SB, Blanton MB, Avila U, Varlamov O, Messaoudi I (2026). BACKGROUND: Maternal obesity is a global health challenge with profound consequences for offspring health. While its impact on metabolic programming has been widely studied, far less is known about how maternal obesity shapes the fetal immune system. The fetal bone marrow (FBM) is the central site of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) development, and disruptions in this niche can have lifelong effects on immunity, infection susceptibility, and inflammatory disease risk. In this study, we examined FBM hematopoiesis in a nonhuman primate model of spontaneous maternal obesity. METHODS: Using spectral flow cytometry, single-cell RNA sequencing, and functional differentiation assays, we mapped progenitor composition, lineage trajectories, and immune function in offspring exposed to maternal obesity compared with lean controls. These complementary approaches allowed us to capture cellular frequencies and transcriptional programs, while trajectory and signaling analyses provided insight into how progenitor maturation and intercellular communication are disrupted by maternal obesity. RESULTS: Our findings reveal that maternal obesity decreases CD34+ HSPCs and common lymphoid progenitor populations, while expanding megakaryocyte-erythroid and granulocyte-monocyte progenitors. Pseudotime analysis demonstrated altered maturation, with cells accumulating at early differentiation states. Transcriptional profiling uncovered a strong inflammatory bias, with myeloid progenitors upregulating alarmins, interferon-stimulated genes, and proinflammatory mediators. Functionally, monocytes derived from obese FBM showed impaired migratory and colony-stimulating capacity, coupled with exaggerated TNFα responses to LPS stimulation. CONCLUSION: Together, these results demonstrate that maternal obesity, even in the absence of obesogenic diet, disrupts fetal bone marrow hematopoiesis by altered HSPC maturation, reprogramming lineage trajectories, and inducing inflammatory bias.",
    "Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor acts through calcium-permeable AMPA receptors to potentiate cocaine reward.. Hofford RS, Wilson R, McArdle C, Euston T, Sens JP, Mastrantoni A, McCabe T, Meckel KR, Wang W, Lucerne KE, Osman A, Raab-Graham KF, Lam TT, Kiraly DD (2026). Neuroimmune interactions have emerged as critical modulators of substance use disorders and may represent promising translational therapeutic targets. In prior work, we demonstrated that the cytokine granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is elevated in mice following cocaine exposure, with circulating levels correlating with cocaine intake and locomotor sensitization. Additionally, exogenous G-CSF enhances cocaine reward and increases low-dose cocaine self-administration. We have further shown that repeated G-CSF administration alters expression of glutamatergic synapse-associated proteins following cocaine-seeking behavior. Building on these findings, the present studies examined the molecular consequences of repeated administration of G-CSF, cocaine, or their combination, with a focus on glutamatergic signaling pathways. We also tested whether altered glutamate receptor expression contributes to G-CSF-mediated enhancement of cocaine reward. Repeated combined administration of G-CSF and cocaine produced robust changes in glutamate-associated and synapse-related protein expression within the nucleus accumbens and medial prefrontal cortex. These molecular adaptations were accompanied by increased synaptic density in the nucleus accumbens. Finally, pharmacological inhibition of calcium-permeable AMPA receptors within the nucleus accumbens reversed the G-CSF-induced enhancement of cocaine conditioned place preference. Together, these findings indicate that G-CSF enhances cocaine reward at least in part by promoting glutamatergic synaptic remodeling in the nucleus accumbens, identifying a neuroimmune-glutamate mechanism that may be leveraged for therapeutic intervention.",
    "Predicting early bactericidal activity of tuberculosis drug combinations using a translational pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling approach.. de Castro Suarez N, Nuermberger EL, Ernest J, Savic R (2026). Phase IIa pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) trials typically assess the early bactericidal activity (EBA) of monotherapy for over 14 days. However, few studies have evaluated drug combinations, even though optimal monotherapy doses may not directly translate to combinations. Translational pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) modeling has shown promise in predicting human treatment responses based on preclinical monotherapy data; however, its application in drug combinations remains limited. This study aimed to extend and validate our previously developed translational monotherapy PK-PD modeling platform to predict the EBA of two-drug combinations. Interactions between bedaquiline, pretomanid, linezolid, and pyrazinamide were characterized using two modeling approaches: the empirical SUPER method and the mechanistic General Pharmacodynamic Interaction model. Both approaches were independently linked to our translational platform and validated using mouse data and Phase IIa clinical results from the NC-001 study. Both modeling methods identified consistent interaction patterns, including antagonistic interactions when bedaquiline was combined with either pretomanid or linezolid. Pyrazinamide has emerged as the most effective companion for both bedaquiline and pretomanid. Our platform reasonably predicted 14-day clinical sputum colony-forming unit counts for multiple two-drug combinations, with most observations falling within the 95% prediction intervals, supporting its use in accelerating regimen development. Our study demonstrated that the translational PK-PD platform reliably predicts both short- and long-term outcomes for combinations, regardless of the interaction model. This supports its application across drug development stages to inform dose selection and effective companion drugs for anti-TB therapies.",
    "GM-CSF regulates ILC states and myeloid cell signaling during ulceration in Crohn's disease.. Morrison JK, Sabic K, Maskey N, Talware S, Hsu NY, Chasteau C, Aslinger E, Herb J, Nayar S, Levantovsky R, Tastad C, Moss R, Soto A, Garcia-Barros M, Ntunzwenimana J, Glass M, Bao M, Zhang J, Han H, Stevens J, Tavares L, Thin TH, Khaitov S, Greenstein A, Brody R, Chu J, Mortha A, Cho JH, Chuang LS (2026). Macrophage (M-), granulocyte (G-), and granulocyte-macrophage (GM-) colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) regulate myeloid cell function, yet their relative roles during inflammation remain poorly defined. To uncover how CSFs shape spatial immune niches in Crohn's disease, we performed Xenium single-cell spatial transcriptomics on ileal tissues, revealing cell-type-specific expression and source-target interactions for each CSF. GM-CSF, unlike M-CSF or G-CSF, was locally enriched in ulcerated regions where lymphocytes adjacent to macrophage aggregates signaled through STAT5 phosphorylation. To study functional consequences, we developed a csf2rb - / - zebrafish model of intestinal injury. Using this model, we found that loss of GM-CSF signaling exacerbated epithelial damage and inflammation, whereas recombinant human GM-CSF limited injury by restraining ILC1 expansion, sustaining ILC3 maintenance, and promoting IL-22 production. Cross-species single-cell analysis revealed conserved ILC gene modules and GM-CSF-dependent transcriptional networks linking lymphoid and myeloid populations. These findings establish GM-CSF as a critical spatial regulator of myeloid- lymphoid crosstalk and intestinal immune homeostasis in Crohn's disease.",
    "Interaction of phosphorus and water supply regulates the maize root system and phosphorus-use efficiency.. Wang M, Xu J, Lyu Y, Luo M, Sun Y, Ye S, Cheng L, Rengel Z, Shen J (2025). INTRODUCTION: Improving phosphorus (P)-use efficiency (PUE) while increasing crop yield is one of the greatest challenges in sustainable P management for sustainable agriculture. Types of P fertilizers and soil water supply impact P availability and crop growth, but how to optimize P fertilizer and water supply to enhance the foraging capacity of roots for P remains unclear. This study was aimed at characterizing the effects of different combinations of P fertilizers and water supply on maize growth, root properties and PUE in calcareous soil. METHODS: A pot experiment with four P fertilizers [monoammonium phosphate (MAP), diammonium phosphate (DAP), ammonium polyphosphate (APP) and urea phosphate (UP)] was conducted under well-watered (watered) and water-deficit (dry) conditions using maize (Zea mays L.) in a greenhouse during the seedling stage. RESULTS: The interaction between P fertilizers and water supply significantly promoted the growth and P uptake of maize by modifying the root morphological and physiological traits. MAP and APP exhibited greater (by up to 62%) total root length in the watered than the dry treatments, resulting in a significant increase in the efficiency of root P acquisition. The APase activity in the rhizosphere soil of MAP and DAP declined (by 37%-62%) significantly, and the rhizosphere soil pH in the DAP treatment was 0.4 units lower in the watered than the dry treatments. APP improved the soil P availability more than the other P fertilizers (17%-41% higher in soil Olsen-P concentration) regardless of water supply. CONCLUSION: Optimal combination of P fertilizers and water supply promotes maize growth and PUE due to stimulating the root capacity to forage for nutrient and water resources by regulating the root morphological and physiological traits. Engineering root/rhizosphere by manipulating the interactions of P fertilizer types and water supply can improve nutrient use-efficiency and sustainable crop production.",
    "Inhibiting OAS3 suppresses the development of clear cell renal cell carcinoma by reducing cell proliferation and altering the tumor immune microenvironment.. Liao X, Huang P, Zhou H (2026). BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitors have been approved for first-line treatment of metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), but limited therapeutic effects have been reported in patients with advanced ccRCC. Investigating vital targets in specific immune interactions and their effect on the tumor microenvironment of ccRCC could provide novel strategies for overcoming the above limitations. METHODS: We investigated the expression characteristics, prognostic role, and immune associations of OAS3 in the tumor microenvironment in patients with ccRCC. The functions of OAS3 in proliferation and migration were explored in 786-O and OS-RC-2 cells by forced OAS3 overexpression or knockdown. Furthermore, a xenograft model was established in C57BL/6 mice to study the combined effects of OAS3 downregulation and anti-PD1 therapy. The growth, proliferation, and apoptosis of tumor cells, as well as the infiltration of CD8+ T cells and M1/M2 macrophages within tumor tissues, were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: OAS3 was upregulated in ccRCC and significantly associated with the overall survival of patients with ccRCC. OAS3 expression levels were correlated with genomic mutation profiles and were positively associated with the infiltration of CD8+ T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells. OAS3 upregulation increased the proliferation, migration, invasion, and colony formation abilities of 786-O and OS-RC-2 cells. In contrast, OAS3 knockdown had the opposite effect. In vivo experiments revealed that OAS3 downregulation repressed the growth and proliferation of tumor cells, and promoted infiltration of M2 macrophages but enhanced the apoptosis and infiltration of CD8+ T cells. The phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 was repressed by OAS3 downregulation. In addition, the combination of anti-PD1 therapy and OAS3 downregulation had synergistic antitumor effects. CONCLUSION: OAS3 is upregulated in ccRCC and promotes tumor progression by mediating the infiltration of immune cells in the TME. OAS3 represents a promising therapeutic target for enhancing the antitumor effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors.",
    "GJB5 expression in pancreatic adenocarcinoma: prognostic significance and therapeutic implications.. Li Y, Ren B, Wu Y, Zhang DM, Xu J, Zhang LX, Quan G (2026). BACKGROUND: Gap junction protein 5 (GJB5) has been associated with tumorigenesis; however, its exact role in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) remains unclear. This study investigates GJB5's expression, its functional roles in tumor progression, and its prognostic significance in PAAD. METHODS: This study used multiple bioinformatics tools, including Tissue Infiltrating Microenvironment Estimation Resource 2, University of Alabama at Birmingham Cancer, Tumor Immune System Interaction Database, Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis 2, and cBioPortal. These tools were used to analyze GJB5 expression, its correlation with immune cell infiltration, and its potential as a prognostic biomarker in PAAD. Functional assays, including cell counting kit-8, colony formation, wound healing, and transwell assays, were performed to investigate the impact of GJB5 on PAAD tumor cell behaviors, including proliferation, migration, and invasion. Additionally, pathways associated with GJB5 and its interactions with the tumor microenvironment were explored. RESULTS: GJB5 was significantly overexpressed in PAAD tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues. Promoter hypomethylation, rather than somatic mutation, was identified as the primary mechanism driving GJB5 upregulation. Survival analysis and Cox regression models indicated that upregulated GJB5 expression is an independent prognostic factor for poor survival in patients with PAAD. Furthermore, GJB5 expression was positively correlated with immune cell infiltration in the PAAD microenvironment. Functional assays exhibited that silencing GJB5 reduced cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in PAAD cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: GJB5 is a significant prognostic biomarker for PAAD and a potential therapeutic target for reversing tumor progression, providing novel strategies for PAAD treatment.",
    "External Evaluation of a Plasma and Cerebrospinal Fluid Population Pharmacokinetics Model of Meropenem in Infants.. Boutzoukas AE, Ngo NB, Balevic S, Hornik CD, Berkovitch M, James LP, Kohn E, Anderson SG, Turdalieva S, Payne EH, Hope W, Lutsar I, Benjamin DK, Greenberg RG (2026). OBJECTIVE: Meropenem is commonly used to treat bloodstream and central nervous system (CNS) infections in preterm and term infants; however, the optimal dosage of meropenem in infants <3 months is not known, and its cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pharmacokinetics (PK) are not well established in this age group. METHODS: We externally evaluated a previously developed meropenem population PK model using opportunistic plasma and CSF PK samples collected in infants and children <2 years of age who received intravenous meropenem per standard of care. We evaluated model performance, and simulated age-dependent dosing regimens (20 and 40 mg/kg every 8 hours [12 hours if gestational age <32 weeks and postnatal age <2 weeks]) to estimate the reduction in CSF bacterial burden. RESULTS: Clinical and PK data from 10 children were used to externally evaluate the NeoMero model; model predictive performance was satisfactory with the addition of NeoMero (n = 167) data. Visual predictive check of combined data showed reasonable concordance between predictions and observed concentrations for plasma and CSF. Dosing simulations adjusted for population minimum inhibitory concentration distributions for Pseudomonas aeruginosa estimated that a 20 mg/kg intravenous bolus dose reduced CSF bacterial burden by a weighted mean 5.13 (SD 1.51) log colony forming unit (CFU), while a 40 mg/kg intravenous bolus dose resulted in a weighted mean 5.48 (SD 1.14) log CFU reduction in CSF. CONCLUSIONS: The original NeoMero model performed reasonably well, and the proposed dosing regimens, that is, 20 or 40 mg/kg every 8 hours (12 hours if gestational age <32 weeks and postnatal age <2 weeks), depending on target MIC are estimated to achieve substantial bacterial killing in the CNS.",
    "Efficient planning and implementation of optimal foraging strategies under energetic constraints.. Guo Y, Hermundstad AM (2026). To successfully forage, animals must balance the energetic cost of searching for food sources with the energetic benefit of exploiting those sources. While the Marginal Value Theorem provides one normative account of this balance by specifying that a forager should leave a food patch when its energetic yield falls below the average yield of other patches in the environment, it assumes the presence of other readily reachable patches. In natural settings, however, a forager does not know whether it will encounter additional food patches, and it must balance potential energetic costs and benefits accordingly. Upon first encountering a patch of food, it faces a decision of whether and when to leave the patch in search of better options, and when to return if no better options are found. Here, we explore how this search should be structured when the existence of other food patches is unknown, and when searching for them requires energy that can only be harvested from a single known food patch. We identify conditions under which it is more favorable to explore the environment in several successive trips rather than in one long exploration, and we show how the optimal sequence of trips depends on the forager's beliefs about the environment. This optimal strategy is well approximated by a local decision rule that can be implemented by a simple neural circuit architecture. Together, this work highlights how energetic constraints and prior beliefs shape optimal foraging strategies, and how such strategies can be approximated by simple neural networks.",
    "\"Sunlight\" illuminates \"empty nests\": the influence of social participation on the multi-dimensional health of empty-nest elderly in China.. Jin Q, Cheng P, Zhou T (2026). OBJECTIVE: To investigate the health of China's empty-nest elderly and the impact of social participation behaviour, quantity and types on their health. METHODS: This national panel data used data from the China Family Panel Studies conducted in 2016, 2018, 2020, and 2022. The relationship between social participation and multidimensional health among empty-nest elderly was examined using a two-way fixed-effects model and instrumental variables. RESULTS: The mean health index for China's empty-nest elderly stands at 0.02, with physical health averaging 0.63, mental health at 26.62, and self-rated health at 2.48. Compared to empty-nest elderly lacking social participation, those with social participation exhibit superior health index, physical health, psychological health, and self-rated health (all P < 0.01). The quantity of social participation correlated with better health index, physical health, mental health, and self-rated health among empty-nest elderly. Economic participation and family participation correlated with better health outcomes among empty-nest elderly. CONCLUSIONS: Social participation has a positive effect on the health of empty-nest elderly. The influence of economic participation and family participation on the health of empty-nest elderly is more prominent.",
    "Mixed fermentation improved apple juice quality: juice characteristics and mechanism.. Lei K, Wang Y, Pu Y, Wang L, Huang Y, Hou X (2026). INTRODUCTION: Fermented apple juice demonstrates significant potential as a functional beverage with health-promoting benefits; however, optimizing its sensory quality remains challenging. This study investigated the effects of fermentation using single and mixed lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains on the quality of 'Red Fuji' apple juice (AJ) from Aksu, Xinjiang. METHODS: Flavor characteristics were assessed using electronic nose, electronic tongue, and HS-SPME/GC-MS, and underlying mechanisms were investigated via non-targeted metabolomics. RESULTS: The results revealed that 'Red Fuji' AJ is an excellent fermentation substrate, with post-fermentation total colony counts consistently exceeding 8.5 log CFU/mL. Mixed fermentation outperformed single fermentation. At the L. helveticus and L. plantarum ratio of 1:2, yielding higher viable cell counts (>9.26 log CFU/mL), superior overall sensory acceptance (p < 0.05), and a more complex and pleasant flavor profile characterized by increased levels of esters, aldehydes, and alcohols, along with significantly reduced bitterness (65.3%) and astringency (74.1%). Metabolomic analysis identified key differential metabolites and metabolic pathways (amino acid metabolism, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and flavonoid biosynthesis), providing a theoretical basis for the flavor enhancement mechanism. DISCUSSION: This study demonstrates that specific mixed LAB fermentation can effectively address common sensory acceptance issues in fermented fruit juices by simultaneously enhancing probioticviability, enriching flavor complexity, and reducing undesirable tastes.",
    "B-Cell Depletion in Glomerular Diseases: Not Always as Safe as We May Think.. Chiarenza DS, Verrina EE, Bigatti C, Caridi G, Spennacchio A, Kajana X, De Bortoli M, Cravedi P, Angeletti A (2026). B-cell depletion with the chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab has revolutionized the treatment of glomerular diseases. Obinutuzumab, a type II glycoengineered anti-CD20 humanized monoclonal antibody, is increasingly being employed as an alternative to rituximab in the management of difficult-to-treat cases, due to deeper and more persistent B-cell depletion. However, its safety profile, especially in pediatric and young adults with glomerular diseases, remains to be fully elucidated. Herein, we report 3 patients who developed severe hematologic toxicity after obinutuzumab infusion. Two patients with steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome developed severe neutropenia (grade 4) at 4-6 weeks after obinutuzumab administration. Both cases were complicated by infections requiring antibiotic therapy, and 1 patient also required granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support. The third child, affected by membranous nephropathy, developed persistent normocytic anemia, necessitating chronic treatment with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. Cytopenia has been described in patients receiving obinutuzumab for the treatment of hematologic malignancies and in subjects with rheumatological conditions. In these conditions, obinutuzumab is often associated with other immune-targeting compounds. Herein, we show that such complication can occur also individuals with glomerular diseases receiving obinutuzumab as the sole treatment. This element should carefully considered when evaluating this treatment, especially for young patients.",
    "The preliminary study on the effect of PSEN1 on the proliferation and invasion of breast cancer cells.. Yang M, Zou JQ, Yang W (2026). BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer among women, and PSEN1 dysfunction is a primary contributor to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. However, the involvement of PSEN1 in breast cancer remains unclear. This study was conducted to explore the function and related mechanisms of PSEN1 in breast cancer cells. METHODS: The correlation between two genes was determined utilizing the R2 platform, and the association between gene expression and prognosis was analyzed employing the Kaplan-Meier plotter. The expression of PSEN1 in breast cancer was assessed by in immunofluorescence. The Transwell assay was employed to detect the migration and invasion capabilities of cells. Colony formation and EdU staining were employed to evaluate the effects of PSEN1 on breast cancer cell proliferation. RESULTS: We observed a positive correlation between the expression of PSEN1 and the prognosis of breast cancer patients. After manipulated the expression of PSEN1 in breast cancer cell lines Sum159 and BT549, we found that PSEN1 could inhibit cell proliferation and growth in breast cancer through colony formation assays and EdU staining. Meanwhile, we revealed that interference with the cell cycle by PSEN1 was associated with cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) in breast cancer samples. Furthermore, we observed that an increase in PSEN1 expression inhibited the invasive capabilities of breast cancer cells, while a decrease in PSEN1 expression enhanced invasion in both Sum159 and BT549 cell lines. Lastly, we discovered a negative correlation between PSEN1 and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) transcription factors as well as markers in breast cancer patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that PSEN1 inhibits the invasion and proliferation of breast cancer cells, suggesting that PSEN1 could potentially serve as a prognostic biomarker and a novel therapeutic target for patients with breast cancer.",
    "CD36 as a potential prognostic biomarker and modulator of the tumor microenvironment in glioma.. Xu L, Sun P (2026). BACKGROUND: Cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) is functioning as a fatty acid transporter, which is implicated in tumor progression. However, whether the pathophysiological functions of CD36 are associated with the prognosis of glioma is still relatively unknown. This study aimed to explore the potential role of CD36 in glioma and to clarify its potential as a possible therapeutic target for glioma. METHODS: Gene expression profiles and clinical data of glioma patients were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) databases. Patients were stratified into high- and low-expression groups for survival assessment. Cox proportional hazards regression models were applied to evaluate the association between CD36 expression levels and overall survival (OS), including both univariate and multivariate analyses. U87, U251, and LN229 glioma cell lines were subjected to CD36 knockdown using small interfering RNA (siRNA). Cell proliferation was measured by the colony formation, Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), and EdU assays. The migration ability was evaluated by Transwell and wound healing assays. To explore potential biological functions, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were subjected to Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses. Immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment (TME) was quantified by Estimate, CIBERSORT, and ssGSEA algorithms, with a focus on macrophages and neutrophils. CD36 mRNA expression was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and correlation analyses were performed to investigate associations between CD36 expression and immune cell infiltration. RESULTS: High expression of CD36 was associated with unfavorable clinicopathological features in glioma patients and may indicate poor prognosis. A prognostic model constructed based on CD36 expression, age, World Health Organization (WHO) grade, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) status, and 1p/19q codeletion status showed good predictive performance for glioma patient outcomes. In vitro, CD36 promoted glioma cell proliferation and migration, thereby contributing to tumor progression. CD36 played an important role in shaping the immune microenvironment of gliomas; its overexpression enhanced the infiltration of myeloid-derived macrophages and neutrophils, leading to an immunosuppressive TME. CONCLUSIONS: CD36 not only serves as a vital biomarker for predicting prognosis and monitoring glioma progression, but also plays a pivotal role in reshaping the TME of glioma. Specifically, CD36 contributes to the development of an immunosuppressive TME, underscoring its significance in the progression of glioma.",
    "Orphan G protein-coupled receptor GPR137 regulates ferroptosis by targeting the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in sonic hedgehog-medulloblastoma.. Ying J, Zhang T, He Y, Chen F, Zhao Q, Jing J (2026). BACKGROUND: The orphan G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) GPR137 is implicated in the proliferation of various tumor cells. However, its role and underlying mechanisms in medulloblastoma (MB), particularly the sonic hedgehog (SHH) subtype, remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the function of GPR137 in SHH-MB and its potential regulation of ferroptosis via the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. METHODS: A GPR137-knockdown Daoy cell line was constructed using lentiviral shRNA. Cell proliferation, invasion, and colony formation were assessed using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), wound healing, and colony formation assays, respectively. Ferroptosis was induced with erastin, and its inhibition was achieved with ferrostatin-1. Key ferroptosis markers, including lipid peroxidation products [malondialdehyde (MDA), 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE)], reactive oxygen species (ROS), glutathione (GSH) levels, and labile iron (Fe²+) were measured. The expression of ferroptosis-related proteins (GPX4, xCT) and Wnt/β-catenin pathway components was analyzed by western blot and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Rescue experiments were performed by overexpressing β-catenin in GPR137-knockdown cells. RESULTS: GPR137 knockdown significantly inhibited Daoy cell proliferation, invasion, and colony formation. It synergized with erastin to aggravate ferroptosis, leading to increased cell death, elevated levels of MDA, 4-HNE, ROS, and Fe²+, alongside decreased GSH and downregulated GPX4 and xCT protein expression. These pro-ferroptotic effects were reversed by ferrostatin-1. Mechanistically, GPR137 depletion downregulated key mRNAs (β-catenin, c-jun, c-myc, cyclin D1, Axin2) and the protein level of β-catenin in the Wnt pathway. Crucially, β-catenin overexpression significantly alleviated the enhanced ferroptosis phenotype caused by GPR137 knockdown. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that GPR137 deletion promotes ferroptosis in SHH-MB cells by inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This reveals a novel regulatory axis in MB and suggests that targeting GPR137 could be a promising therapeutic strategy for SHH-MB.",
    "MicroRNA-374b-5p suppresses osteosarcoma progression via the PDPK1-mediated AKT pathway.. Xi Y, Sun Z, Wu J, Ren Y, Zhou D (2026). BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been verified to be involved in various biological processes through regulating their target genes, and some previous studies have revealed the antitumour role of microRNA-374b-5p (miR-374b-5p) in several tumours. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore the functions and potential mechanisms of miR-374b-5p in osteosarcoma (OS) progression. METHODS: The differentially expressed gene miR-374b-5p was discovered in the dataset GSE65071 from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database via bioinformatics analysis, and its expression levels in OS tissues and cell lines were confirmed by RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) staining and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). OS cell proliferation ability was evaluated by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and colony formation assay, cell migration and invasion abilities were assessed by Transwell assays, and apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. The underlying mechanisms of miR-374b-5p in regulating OS progression were explored by qRT-PCR, dual-luciferase reporter assay and western blotting. In vivo experiments, a nude mice xenograft tumour model was performed to evaluate the effects of miR-374b-5p on tumour growth and gene expression changes. RESULTS: In this study, miR-374b-5p expression was confirmed to be significantly down-regulated in OS, and miR-374b-5p overexpression could inhibit the proliferation, migration, and invasion abilities but promote apoptosis of OS cells. Mechanism studies revealed that miR-374b-5p suppressed the AKT pathway via negatively regulating the expression of phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDPK1). Notably, PDPK1 were highly expressed in OS cell lines, as verified by qRT-PCR, and PDPK1-silencing considerably restrained OS progression. Moreover, the inhibitory effects of miR-374b-5p on OS progression were partially reversed by PDPK1 overexpression both in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: MiR-374b-5p was lowly expressed in OS, and its upregulation inhibited the progression of OS by directly targeting PDPK1 to affect the activity of the AKT pathway.",
    "PHGDH knockdown activates autophagic flux to suppress migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells.. Li S, Cao Y, Xu W, Wang X, Li R, Huang J, Zhang H (2026). BACKGROUND: Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), the key rate-limiting enzyme responsible for controlling the serine biosynthetic pathway, has been implicated in metabolic reprogramming in numerous cancers. Despite this, its significance and regulatory mechanistic relevance in gastric cancer (GC) have yet to be fully elucidated. Here, we sought to elucidate the influence of PHGDH on autophagy and malignant phenotypes in GC and to elucidate its mechanistic relevance in GC progression. METHODS: GC tissues and adjacent noncancerous tissues (n=7 pairs) were assessed for PHGDH expression by Western blotting, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and immunohistochemistry. GC cell lines with differential PHGDH expression were screened, and stable knockdown and overexpression models were established. Functional assays, including MTS assays, colony formation, wound healing, and Transwell migration assays, were performed to evaluate proliferation and motility, respectively. Western blotting and autophagic flux assays, as well as analyses of live-cells expressing mRFP-GFP-LC3, were used to evaluate ROS production and autophagy. RESULTS: PHGDH was upregulated in GC tissues (n=7 pairs) with a stage-dependent trend, though larger cohorts are needed to confirm this pattern. Downregulation of PHGDH curtailed MGC803 cell growth, migratory and invasive abilities, and triggered apoptosis, while overexpression enhanced cell motility. Mechanistically, PHGDH silencing increased ROS and HIF-1α levels, reduced mTOR phosphorylation, and facilitated autophagic flux, as demonstrated by elevated LC3-II and reduced P62 expression. These changes were further confirmed by 3-MA/CQ treatment and mRFP-GFP-LC3 imaging. Notably, PHGDH downregulation may indirectly promote the assembly of the ULK1 complex through the concomitant upregulation of FIP200 and ATG101, thereby initiating autophagy. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that PHGDH plays a role in the progression of GC and may be considered a potential therapeutic target upon further confirmation in larger clinical studies.",
    "Neutropenia Potentially Associated With Remifentanil Administered for Respiratory Drive Suppression: A Case Report.. Watanabe H, Minami K, Takeuchi M (2026). Remifentanil-related neutropenia (< 500/μL) has not been previously described. We encountered it in an 81-year-old man after aortic surgery complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome. While receiving remifentanil at 0.04-0.08 μg/kg/min to suppress excessive respiratory effort in the intensive care unit, his neutrophil count plummeted from 20,690/μL to 2400/μL. Suspect drugs were stopped and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor given, yet neutropenia persisted until remifentanil was withdrawn, after which neutrophils recovered. When respiratory status deteriorated, remifentanil was restarted, and neutropenia promptly recurred. The temporal relationship, dechallenge, and rechallenge strongly implicate remifentanil as the cause of this rare adverse reaction. This case highlights the need for vigilance regarding hematologic toxicity with any medication, even those without prior reports, and underscores the importance of prompt review and withdrawal of potential offending agents when severe neutropenia develops.",
    "Understanding the development of bacterial colony: Physiology, new technology, and modeling.. Zhu J, Chu P, Fu X (2025). Bacterial colonies, as dynamic ecosystems, display intricate behaviors and organizational structures that profoundly influence their survival and functionality. These communities engage in physiological and social interactions, resulting in remarkable spatial heterogeneity. Recent advancements in technology and modeling have significantly enhanced our comprehension of these phenomena, shedding light on the underlying mechanisms governing bacterial colony development. In this review, we explore the multifaceted aspects of bacterial colonies, emphasizing their physiological intricacies, innovative research tools, and predictive modeling approaches. By integrating diverse perspectives, we aim to deepen our understanding of these microbial communities and pave the way for novel applications in biotechnology, ecology, and medicine.",
    "A portable device for probiotic counting and viability assessment based on microfluidic chip and image recognition.. Sun X, Zhang J, Chen J, Yang L, Pang X, Chen X, Chen Y, Zhang Y, Chen A (2025). Probiotics play a critical role in maintaining or improving gut microbiome balance, offering numerous health benefits. Therefore, the accurate quantification of viable probiotics is essential for ensuring the efficacy of probiotic products. However, traditional culture-based methods are cumbersome and time-intensive, limiting their applications in scenarios requiring real-time decisions. Here, we report a portable, cost-effective system (approximately $2 per test, including reagents and one-time microfluidic chip usage) that enables rapid (3 min) on-site quantification of viable probiotics through a microfluidic chip integrated with a fluorescent biosensor and advanced image recognition technology. The system's reliability and accuracy were validated by comparison with the standard flow cytometry and plate counting, with results showing no significant differences in viable probiotics numbers. Furthermore, the platform demonstrated excellent specificity in distinguishing dead probiotics from viable ones with a large quantification range of 107-1011 colony-forming units (CFU) mL-1, which encompasses the concentration range of commonly encountered probiotics, thereby meeting practical detection requirements. In summary, this portable system offers an innovative solution for rapid, on-site identification, and precise quantification of live and dead probiotics. Given these attributes, the system demonstrates significant commercial potential, particularly in situations requiring immediate results and efficient decision-making.",
    "Lactobacillus johnsonii-FM1 modulates gut microbiota and secretes anticancer metabolite vanillic acid to inhibit colorectal tumorigenesis.. Lyu W, Chen L, Li DF, Li SY, Dai Q, Zhou HL, Liu YY, Zhou JY, Liang XJ, Wang L (2025). During colorectal cancer (CRC) progression, probiotics support gut microbial balance, enhance intestinal barrier integrity, and exert antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Such supplementation may slow tumor growth and serve as an adjunctive therapy for CRC. In this study, we evaluated the impact of Lactobacillus johnsonii-FM1 in Apc Min/+ and azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium-induced CRC mouse models. Our results demonstrate that L. johnsonii-FM1 markedly reduces tumor number, size, and volume in both models. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing showed that L. johnsonii-FM1 increases the abundance of potentially beneficial taxa while decreasing opportunistic pathogens, thereby preserving gut barrier function. Moreover, untargeted metabolomics paired with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry identified vanillic acid (VCA) as a key bioactive metabolite produced by L. johnsonii-FM1. In vitro, VCA inhibits CRC cell line proliferation, diminishes colony formation, induces cell-cycle arrest, and promotes apoptosis. Mechanistically, VCA attenuates CRC progression by suppressing Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Our findings suggest a promising probiotic-based adjunctive strategy for CRC prevention and treatment.",
    "Alcohol Use, Demographics and Mental Health of Women Using a Digital Peer Support Program.. Robinson LD, Ingram I, Degan TJ, van de Ven K, Lee NK (2026). BACKGROUND: Risky alcohol use is rising among some groups of women. This trend is concerning given their vulnerability to alcohol-related harm arising from biological and socio-cultural factors. Stigma, caregiving responsibilities, and limited childcare often reduce access to traditional treatment. Concurrently, population-wide increases in psychological distress are driving demand for support services. Digital interventions for alcohol use like the Daybreak app may offer accessible, anonymous early intervention, helping to overcome barriers and meet unmet needs. METHODS: Data were analysed from 41 052 women who registered for the Daybreak app between 2019 and 2024. Participants completed demographic questions, the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption (AUDIT-C), and the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) online. RESULTS: AUDIT-C scores differed significantly by age, with the highest scores among women aged 35-54 years and the lowest among those aged 75 and over. Overall, 97.7% of participants scored above the recommended cut-off for high-risk drinking, with rates remaining stable over time. Additionally, 96.6% met the threshold for potential alcohol dependence. Based on K10 scores, 57.8% of participants reported high or very high psychological distress. CONCLUSION: By reaching women with high-risk drinking and psychological distress, the Daybreak app may offer accessible support outside traditional services. Daybreak's growing use, especially among younger women, indicates that continued investment and broader promotion of digital interventions may be warranted.",
    "Quantifying Dietary Breadth in Howlers: How Much Sampling Is Enough?. Rangel Negrín A, Dias PAD (2026). Accurate characterization of dietary breadth is fundamental to understanding animal ecology, yet comparative studies based on inconsistent sampling protocols have often confounded measurements of behavioral variation. We address a critical question: how much observation effort is required to adequately characterize dietary breadth in mantled howler monkeys (Alouatta palliata)? Using a comprehensive ten-year dataset, we applied multiple complementary accumulation curve approaches (abundance-based, incidence-based, and time-based) to 56,540 feeding observations totaling 6828 observation hours across two groups. Sample coverage exceeded 0.99 for both groups, confirming near-complete sampling. Species accumulation curves revealed that characterizing dietary breadth to near-completion required approximately 5000-5200 observation hours. The first 1500-3000 h captured 85%-100% of dietary diversity, with accumulation rates declining dramatically (> 95%) beyond this threshold. Overall accumulation rates averaged 0.006-0.007 species per hour. Monthly incidence-based approaches required 7-8 years of continuous sampling to reach asymptotic levels. Despite occupying neighboring habitats, groups differed substantially in observation hours required to reach equivalent species milestones, highlighting how foraging selectivity affects sampling requirements. Coverage-based rarefaction enabled comparison at equivalent sampling completeness (0.999 coverage), revealing that Group 1 exhibited higher estimated richness (51.3 species) than Group 2 (36.2 species), though overlapping 95% confidence intervals precluded definitive conclusions about between-group differences. Our results provide practical sampling benchmarks for this species and demonstrate methodological approaches applicable to primate dietary studies. We recommend that dietary studies routinely report accumulation curves and sample coverage statistics to enable assessment of sampling adequacy. La caracterización precisa de la amplitud dietaria es fundamental para comprender la ecología animal; sin embargo, los estudios comparativos frecuentemente tienen protocolos de muestreo inconsistentes que confunden la variación biológica con problemas metodológicos. Abordamos una pregunta crítica: ¿cuánto esfuerzo de observación se requiere para caracterizar adecuadamente la amplitud dietaria en monos aulladores de manto (Alouatta palliata)? Utilizando un conjunto de datos exhaustivo de diez años, aplicamos múltiples enfoques complementarios de curvas de acumulación (basados en abundancia, en incidencia y en tiempo) a 56,540 observaciones de alimentación que totalizan 6828 horas de observación en dos grupos. La cobertura muestral superó 0.99 en ambos grupos, confirmando un muestreo casi completo. Las curvas de acumulación de especies revelaron que caracterizar la amplitud dietaria hasta casi su totalidad requiere aproximadamente 5000–5200 horas de observación. Las primeras 1500–3000 horas capturaron 85–100% de la diversidad dietaria, con tasas de acumulación que disminuyeron drásticamente (> 95%) más allá de este umbral. Las tasas globales de acumulación promediaron 0.006–0.007 especies por hora. Los enfoques basados en incidencia mensual requirieron 7–8 años de muestreo continuo para alcanzar niveles asintóticos. A pesar de ocupar hábitats vecinos, los grupos difirieron sustancialmente en las horas de observación requeridas para alcanzar hitos equivalentes de especies, lo que destaca cómo la selectividad de forrajeo afecta los requerimientos de muestreo. La rarefacción basada en cobertura permitió la comparación a un mismo nivel de completitud de muestreo (cobertura de 0.999), revelando que el Grupo 1 exhibió una riqueza estimada mayor (51.3 especies) que el Grupo 2 (36.2 especies), aunque la superposición de los intervalos de confianza del 95% impidieron obtener conclusiones definitivas sobre las diferencias entre grupos. Nuestros resultados aportan puntos de referencia prácticos para el muestreo de esta especie y demuestran enfoques metodológicos aplicables a los estudios de dieta en primates. Recomendamos que los estudios sobre dieta reporten de manera rutinaria curvas de acumulación y estadísticas de cobertura muestral para permitir la evaluación de la adecuación del muestreo.",
    "Sand fly endosymbionts in Kenya: Rickettsia and Wolbachia associations with Leishmania and detection of Rickettsia africae.. Kiplagat S, Matoke-Muhia D, Owino BO, Tchouassi DP, Masiga DK, Hurst GDD, Villinger J (2026). BACKGROUND: Sand flies are small hematophagous insects known as leishmaniasis vectors. Similar to most arthropods, they harbor nonobligate endosymbionts that may influence host adaptation and pathogen transmission, but these symbiont communities remain poorly characterized in Leishmania-endemic African sand flies. METHODS: We screened 1700 wild-caught phlebotomine sand flies (1266 females, 434 males) from Kenya's Baringo, Nakuru, and Kajiado counties, and 253 colony Phlebotomus duboscqi, for Rickettsia, Wolbachia, Spiroplasma, Cardinium, Arsenophonus, Microsporidia, and Leishmania by high-resolution melting analysis and sequencing of PCR products. RESULTS: In wild sand flies (Phlebotomus and Sergentomyia spp.), Wolbachia spp. were most common (8.5%, 145/1700), with particularly high prevalences in Ph. mireillae (92.3%, 12/13), Ph. guggisbergi (73.2%, 82/112), and Ph. saevus (48.6%, 18/37), followed by Spiroplasma (1.4%, 23/1700), Rickettsia (0.7%, 12/1700), Cardinium (0.4%, 6/1700), Tubulinosema sp. (0.1%, 1/1700), and various gut bacteria (1.8%, 30/1700). In addition, we detected Rickettsia africae, a tick-borne pathogen causing African tick-bite fever (ATBF), in Ph. martini (4.7%, 5/106), Ph. guggisbergi (1.8%, 2/112), S. schwetzi (0.4%, 1/263), S. clydei (0.5%, 2/440), and Sergentomyia sp. (0.3%, 1/371). Notably, R. africae DNA was found in one male Ph. martini and Rickettsia sp. DNA in one male S. clydei and one male S. schwetzi, consistent with infection rather than blood-meal contamination. Furthermore, Rickettsia endosymbionts were positively associated with Leishmania DNA (OR = 20.31; 95% CI [4.93, 77.03]; P < 0.0001), including within Phlebotomus (OR = 13.54; 95% CI [2.33, 78.88]; P = 0.0017). Wolbachia also correlated with Leishmania overall (OR = 2.46; 95% CI [1.17, 4.79]; P = 0.011), though not within individual fly genera. Colony Ph. duboscqi harbored only Serratia and other gut bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: Sand flies in Kenya harbored six endosymbionts, including the first detection of pathogenic R. africae in sand flies, and gut bacteria that may influence vector competence. The frequent co-occurrence of Rickettsia and Wolbachia endosymbionts with Leishmania indicates nonrandom associations between symbionts and parasite infection, without implying causality. These findings reveal previously undescribed sand-fly-microbe interactions, and highlight the need for experimental studies to test whether sand flies contribute to the ecology and potential transmission of ATBF.",
    "Integrating species distribution modeling and climate projections to predict ant species redistribution.. Khalili-Moghadam A, Tahmasebi P (2026). As ecologically dominant keystone species, ants play critical roles in ecosystem functioning and trophic interactions. This study examines current and future distribution patterns of five ant species (Cataglyphis nodus, Crematogaster subdentata, Lasius neglectus, Messor platyceras, and Messor syriacus) across central Iran's forest, grassland, and human-modified landscapes. Species were collected along an ecological gradient extending from the central Zagros Mountains to Gavkhouni Lake on the Iranian Plateau. Using an ensemble species distribution modeling (SDM) approach incorporating five machine learning algorithms (Generalized Additive Model, GAM, Generalized Boosted Model, GBM, Generalized Linear Model, GLM, Random Forests, RF, and Extreme Gradient Boosting, XGBOOST), we evaluated habitat suitability under climate change scenarios (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways, SSP126 to SSP585, 2021-2040, 2041-2060, 2061-2080, 2081-2100). Environmental predictors included 19 bioclimatic variables, topography, and NDVI-derived vegetation indices to assess current habitat suitability and to project future distributions under climate change scenarios from 2021 to 2100. Our best ensemble model (GBM) showed strong predictive performance (Receiver Operating Characteristic, ROC,: 0.78-0.90; max True Skill Statistic, TSS,: 0.75), identifying temperature variables, precipitation metrics, and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index ,NDVI, as key environmental drivers. Projected range changes (2021-2100) revealed species-specific responses: C. nodus, C. subdentata and M. platyceras showed maximum gains and losses under SSP126 and SSP585 respectively in different period; L. neglectus displayed extreme reduction potential, exhibited maximum gains and losses under SSP245 and SSP585 respectively in different period; while M. syriacus showed relative stability maximum gains and losses under SSP370 and SSP585 in different period, highlighting significant interspecific variability in climate change vulnerability across emission scenarios. Niche breadth analysis identified C. nodus and M. platyceras as \"winners\" transitioning toward generalist strategies, while C. subdentata remained a vulnerable specialist. These findings highlight: (1) substantial interspecific variability in climate vulnerability, (2) the critical influence of emission scenarios on distributional outcomes, and (3) the importance of vegetation-mediated microclimates in buffering climate impacts. Conservation efforts must prioritize microhabitat preservation and landscape connectivity, particularly for functionally important species. The results provide crucial insights for conservation prioritization in arid land ecosystems under global change.",
    "Comparing and combining xevinapant with ATR and PARP inhibition for the radiosensitization of HPV-negative HNSCC cells.. Roehrle J, Perugachi-Heinsohn A, Gatzemeier F, Christiansen S, Petersen C, Rothkamm K, Betz C, Kriegs M, Zech HB, Rieckmann T (2026). Radiochemotherapy with the apoptosis stimulator xevinapant demonstrated superiority over radiochemotherapy in a randomized phase 2 trial in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) but the subsequent phase 3 trial failed. Here, we compared the radiosensitization through xevinapant with two other emerging approaches, the inhibition of ATR and PARP through tuvusertib and olaparib, in a panel of four radioresistant HPV-negative HNSCC cell lines (HSC4, UT-SCC-60A, SAS, SAT). Without irradiation the analyses of proliferation and colony formation showed varying sensitivities of the cell lines towards the different agents and their combinations. When combined with radiation in colony formation assays, we observed moderate radiosensitization through xevinapant in individual cell lines but not in general. Both tuvusertib and olaparib induced stronger radiosensitization than xevinapant and combining both agents resulted in especially profound radiosensitization in three out of the four cell lines tested, whereas their combination with xevinapant or the combination of xevinapant with cisplatin was less effective. Assessment of cell death induction via annexin V/DAPI staining failed to generally predict cytotoxicity or radiosensitization of these approaches. Overall, our data are in line with the recent failure of the phase 3 TrilynX trial and suggest further investigation of ATR and PARP inhibition for the curative treatment of HPV-negative HNSCC.",
    "Climate-driven reproductive decline in Southern right whales.. Charlton C, Germishuizen M, O'Shannessy B, McCauley R, Vermeulen E, Seyboth E, Brownell RL Jr, Burnell S (2026). Reproductive success and abundance trends in migratory baleen whales are linked to body condition and foraging success, making them vulnerable to changes in prey availability which is influenced by climate variation. Southern right whales (Eubalaena australis), a sentinel species for climate change, offer critical insight into Southern Ocean health. Using over three decades (1991–2024) of photo-identification data collected in southwest Australia, we document a significant decline in reproductive output driving a slowed rate of population increase in the last decade. Cross-correlation and principal component analyses reveal that prolonged calving intervals coincide with declining Antarctic Sea ice concentration, persistent positive Antarctic Oscillation, and increases in surface chlorophyll-a, signalling broader ecosystem shifts. These findings add to global evidence of the sensitivity of southern right whales to climate variability in their offshore foraging grounds. This reproductive decline represents a threshold warning for the species and highlights the need for coordinated conservation efforts in the Southern Ocean, in the face of anthropogenic climate change.",
    "Neural tuning for ordinal processing: convergent patterns in human brains and artificial networks.. Hofstetter S, Daghlian M, Dumoulin SO (2026). Processing ordinality, i.e., the rank of an item in a series such as 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc., is a fundamental skill shared by humans and animals. While humans often use symbolic sequences like numbers or letters, ordinality does not depend on language or symbols. Across species, ordinality plays a critical role in behaviors such as decision-making, foraging, and social organization. We hypothesize that ordinality perception is supported by neuronal tuning, i.e., neurons selectively responsive to specific ranks. Using ultra-high field 7T fMRI and population receptive field (pRF) modeling in human participants (both female and male), we identified neural populations in parietal and premotor cortices that are tuned to non-symbolic ordinal positions. Comparable to other sensory domains, tuning width increased with preferred ordinal rank, suggesting reduced precision and potentially lower perceptual accuracy for higher ranks. Additionally, pRF measurements revealed that cortical territory devoted to higher ordinalities decreased with rank, reinforcing that neural precision is greatest for early positions (e.g., 1st and 2nd) and declines with rank. These responses did not generalize to symbolic ordinality. Similar tuning to non-symbolic ordinality emerged spontaneously in hierarchical convolutional neural networks trained on visual tasks. Together, these results suggest that the tuning properties of these neuronal populations support non-symbolic ordinality perception, and may reflect an inherent feature of neural processing.Significance Statement Processing ordinality, the rank of items in sequences, is a fundamental skill shared across humans and animals that plays a role in decision-making, foraging, and social organization. We hypothesized that ordinality processing relies on neuronal tuning where neurons selectively respond to particular ranks. Using ultra-high field 7T fMRI and population receptive field modeling, we identified neural populations in parietal and premotor cortices tuned to non-symbolic ordinal positions. Additionally, similar tuning responses were found to spontaneously emerge in hierarchical convolutional neural networks trained on a visual task. Our findings demonstrate that akin to other forms of quantity representation, neuronal tuning underlies non-symbolic ordinality perception. These results shed light on the neuronal processing of ordinality in the human brain.",
    "Higher humoral response in ileal versus colonic Crohn's disease.. Vieujean S, Jacobs N, Fernández-Verdejo R, Fraussen J, Baiwir D, Mazzucchelli G, Reenaers C, Van Kemseke C, Louis E, Pierre N (2026). INTRODUCTION: Despite its interest for the development of personalised medicine, the immunological differences between ileal and colonic Crohn's disease (CD) have been understudied. For unknown reasons, some circulating antibodies are associated with CD location (ileal CD: anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies, anti-flagellins antibodies, anti-granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor autoantibodies, and some pancreatic autoantibodies; colonic CD: perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies). Based on these observations, we hypothesised that, in tissues, the humoral response differs between ileal and colonic CD. METHODS: This hypothesis was tested by analysing the expression of IgA1, IgA2, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgM and immunoglobulin J chain (IGJ) in our previous dataset comparing the proteome of ulcer edges and adjacent normal mucosa (paired design) in the ileum (4 428 proteins screened in 16 biopsies) and colon (5 204 proteins screened in 16 biopsies) of 16 patients with CD. RESULTS: All these proteins were increased in ileal ulcer edges compared with adjacent normal mucosa, whereas only IgG3 was increased in colonic ulcer edges compared with adjacent normal mucosa. CONCLUSION: These data highlight the distinct role of humoral immunity in ileal and colonic CD, thereby opening a new avenue of research for developing therapies tailored to CD location.",
    "Morpho-molecular characterization and pathogenicity of Geotrichum candidum causing potato rubbery rot: a new record from India.. Padiyal A, Pooja, Chauhan P, Thakur S, Dhir S, Mittal D, Kumar A, Pandey AK (2026). As a staple vegetable crop, potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) has high nutritional value, affordability, and higher productivity across the world. However, a number of fungal diseases, significantly hamper productivity and quality during postharvest worldwide, including in India. In 2025, rubbery rot disease associated with potato was noticed in markets of Mullana and Ismailabad, Haryana, India. In total, 30 symptomatic potato samples were collected from different retailers and studied for associated causal agents. The isolated fungal species from 30 samples showed similar cultural and morphological features, therefore representative isolates PRR01 and PRR02 were subjected for molecular characterization. Multi-locus (ITS and tef-1 alpha) phylogenetic analysis of consensus sequence data of isolates PRR01 and PRR02 revealed that both isolates were >99.9% identical to Geotrichum candidum isolates CBS 116.28 and BAI; thus, confirming the identity. In pathogenicity test, the inoculated tubers exhibited a whitish colony on the surface, and the infected tissues emitted a putrid smell, after 10 days post incubation. The internal tissues of the potato became rubbery with no significant discoloration, after 30 days post incubation. Koch's postulates were also confirmed by re-isolating the fungal pathogens. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of rubbery rot disease of potato from India. These findings provide critical information for understanding the disease's etiology and offer a foundation for developing potential mitigation strategies to safeguard potato production.",
    "Oncogenic crosstalk between ErbB2, nucleolin and Ras.. Zysman G, Kochavi A, Haklai R, Pinkas-Kramarski R (2026). Overexpression of ErbB receptors, their signaling components and expression of mutant Ras are major contributors to cancer development. Mutant Ras can affect ErbB receptors activation, and the nucleolar protein nucleolin (NCL) can bind and activate ErbB receptors. Previously it was also demonstrated that activated Ras could interact and enhance nucleolin and ErbB1 receptors interaction. Moreover, it was shown that this interaction enhances tumor cell growth. Since ErbB receptors are major oncogenes and ErbB2 is often overexpressed in many cancer types, in the present study we explored the link between ErbB2, Ras and nucleolin oncogenes. Using cell biology and biochemistry methods we have demonstrated that NCL interaction with ErbB2 is enhanced by H-Ras (12 V) protein. The three proteins colocalize mainly at the plasma membrane, and in other intracellular sites. Using proximity ligation assay, we show that H-Ras (12 V) enhances the formation of ErbB2/NCL complexes, which reside mainly at the plasma membrane but may also be in the cytosol and nucleus. The interaction of the three oncogenes is associated with enhanced ErbB2 phosphorylation as well as ErbB2 mediated downstream signaling to Erk and Akt. Moreover, expression of the three proteins enhances colony formation, anchorage independent growth and cell migration. Thus, activated Ras can enhance the oncogenic effect of ErbB2 and NCL. These findings can be used to develop new ways to treat tumors that overexpress ErbB2/nucleolin and mutant Ras.",
    "The oncogenic role of U2AF2/HKDC1 cascade in colorectal cancer by promoting cancer cell glycolysis and malignant phenotypes.. Feng W, Wu M, Zou H, Chen Y (2026). BACKGROUND: Dysregulation of hexokinase domain component 1 (HKDC1), a central regulator of glucose metabolism, plays a pathogenic role in colorectal cancer (CRC). The current research investigated the RNA-binding protein (RBP)-mediated mechanism in driving HKDC1 dysregulation in CRC. METHODS: Expression of mRNAs was detected by quantitative PCR, and protein expression analysis was performed by immunoblot and immunohistochemical assays. Cell invasiveness, migration, apoptosis, colony formation and proliferation were evaluated by transwell, wound healing, TUNEL staining, colony formation, and CCK-8 assays, respectively. Glucose consumption and lactate production were quantified to examine glycolysis. Luciferase, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and mRNA stability assays were used to confirm the U2AF2/HKDC1 relationship. Xenograft models were established to examine the in vivo function. RESULTS: In human CRC, HKDC1 and U2AF2 were present at higher levels, and HKDC1 expression was positively associated with U2AF2 level. Cells with HKDC1 depletion presented repressed growth, enhanced apoptosis, reduced migratory capacity, as well as suppressive invasiveness and glycolysis. Mechanistically, U2AF2 stabilized HKDC1 mRNA and induced HKDC1 protein upregulation. Depletion of U2AF2 decreased cell growth, migratory capacity, invasiveness, and glycolysis and promoted apoptosis in vitro, as well as diminished the in vivo tumorigenicity of HCT116 cells, which could be partially abolished by HKDC1 increase. CONCLUSION: Our observations demonstrate that U2AF2 works as an mRNA-stabilizing factor for HKDC1, and the U2AF2/HKDC1 axis contributes to CRC glycolysis and development. Targeting the novel axis might form the basis of a promising therapy for CRC treatment.",
    "The bone marrow niche and hematopoietic system are distinctly remodeled by CD45-targeted astatine-211 radioimmunotherapy.. Hagen MW, Setiawan NJ, Dexter SL, Woodruff KA, Gaerlan FLK, Billings TM, Orozco JJ, Termini CM (2026). Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) is used to treat patients with hematological malignancies known to infiltrate the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. RIT uses target-specific monoclonal antibodies stably conjugated to radionuclides to deliver cytotoxic radiation to cells of interest. While RIT is effective at delivering radiation to cancer cells, normal tissue is also exposed to radiation upon RIT, the consequences of which are largely unknown. Here, we studied the cellular and molecular effects of CD45-targeted astatine-211 (211At) RIT, IgG non-targeted 211At RIT, and Cesium-137 total-body irradiation (TBI) on hematopoietic cells and their BM niche in wild-type immunocompetent mice. Relative to non-targeted RIT or TBI, CD45-targeted RIT significantly delayed hematopoietic regeneration overall in the peripheral blood and BM and reduced hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell recovery and colony-forming ability. While BM endothelial cells (ECs) do not express the CD45 antigen, CD45-targeted RIT significantly depleted BM ECs compared to non-targeted RIT or TBI. RNA sequence analysis revealed significantly different transcriptomic profiles of BM ECs from CD45-RIT-treated mice compared to non-targeted RIT or TBI. ECs from CD45-RIT-treated mice, but not TBI or IgG-RIT-treated mice, were transcriptionally enriched for growth factor signaling pathways compared to untreated mice. Bone marrow soluble growth factor expression remained upregulated in CD45-RIT-treated mice 28 days post-treatment compared to non-treated mice. Collectively, our study indicates that CD45-targeted RIT severely impacts hematopoietic and EC niche recovery compared to non-targeted approaches. Future studies are required to determine the long-term consequences of such RIT-driven effects on BM niche physiology and how BM niche reprogramming by RIT affects cancer cells.",
    "Conformity and individual preference shape nest material use in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata).. Self JL, Camacho-Alpízar A, Binwal P, Mir U, Stanescu S, Whittaker BA, Guillette LM (2026). Culture, learned behaviours shared within a group, is found in diverse species and critically impacts fitness. Culture arises through social learning and persists when newcomers adopt group norms via conformity and conformist transmission. We examined conformity and conformist transmission in a novel context: avian nest building, testing whether male zebra finches, the primary nest builders in this species, forgo their preferred nest material colour in favour of the majority-demonstrated alternative, and whether the likelihood of switching was disproportionate relative to majority size. First, we determined each male's preferred colour and preference strength. Then, each male, paired with a female, was introduced into a population containing four conspecific pairs, each incubating eggs in a nest. Populations varied in the number of nests (0-4) built using the male's non-preferred colour material. After three days, males were given both material colours for nest construction. Males with weaker preferences were more likely to conform, using the majority-demonstrated, non-preferred colour, whereas males with stronger preferences resisted social influence. Although males often acquired social information - evidenced by their initial interactions with the majority-demonstrated material - this did not consistently translate into conformist nest-building behaviour. These findings show socially influenced nest-building and individual variation in susceptibility to social information.",
    "Urine resazurin reduction ratio as a biomarker of urinary tract infection in people with neurogenic bladder: A first in human study.. Fox AP, Aguirre Guemez AV, Skipwith C, Cavin C, Groah SL (2026). Among people with neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD), urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common infection and a leading cause of morbidity. UTI diagnosis is based on urinary symptoms, bladder inflammation (urinalysis (UA)), and bacterial growth (standard urine culture (SUC)), the latter two assessments taking approximately 24h and 48-72h, respectively. Here, urine resazurin reduction ratio (uRRR), which is a measure of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrogen conversion, a bioproduct of bacterial metabolism, is assessed as a point-of-care biomarker of UTI with time to result (TTR) of 1 hour. The objectives of this first-in-human study are to evaluate the relationship between the uRRR and: urinary symptoms, urine white blood cell (uWBC) count, urine nitrite, bacterial growth on standard urine culture (SUC), and the likelihood of UTI based on combinations of these. This is a cross-sectional study of participants who completed the Urinary Symptom Questionnaire for people with Neurogenic Bladder (USQNB) and provided urine samples (N = 289). Accuracy of uRRR when compared to colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL) obtained by SUC was 92.73%. A significant relationship was found between higher uRRR and positive uWBC (p < 0.0001), positive nitrite (p < 0.0001), and symptoms (p < 0.0001). uRRR values were significantly higher in the UTI positive group, which was defined as a combination of positive symptoms, bladder inflammation, and bacterial growth. In this first report of uRRR as a potential biomarker and rapid diagnostic assessment of UTI among people with NLUTD, uRRR was associated with each of the standard of care diagnostic assessments individually and when combined into UTI likelihood groups. Given these encouraging preliminary data, next steps will be to assess uRRR in a prospective clinical trial to determine whether point-of-care uRRR provides clinically actionable information equivalent or superior to standard of care assessments when diagnosing and treating suspected UTI in this population.",
    "Generation of osteoclast-like cells from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells using NFATc1 modified RNA.. Srihirun S, Phruksaniyom C, Sriwantana T, Parakaw T, Sibmooh N, Vivithanaporn P, Suknuntha K (2026). Inhibition of osteoclasts, a type of bone-resorptive cell, is a key approach for treating diseases associated with bone loss. Although human osteoclasts can be generated from receptor activator of nuclear factor-ĸB ligand-mediated stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in vitro, the differentiation rate is low and the process is time consuming. Here, we aimed to generate osteoclast-like cells from human PBMCs using modified RNA (modRNA) enforcing NFATc1, a master transcription factor that functions downstream of receptor activator of nuclear factor-ĸB receptor activation. Human PBMCs isolated from the venous blood of healthy donors (n = 3) using Histopaque density gradient centrifugation were expanded in medium supplemented with 25 ng/mL macrophage colony-stimulating factor for 3 days. The isolated macrophages were transfected with NFATc1 modRNA. The osteoclast-like cells were evaluated for the following osteoclast-specific markers: tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive expression, F-actin ring formation, cathepsin expression, and bone resorption activity. Scanning electron microscopy was used to morphologically characterize the osteoclast-like cells. At day 1 posttransfection with 25, 50, and 100 ng/mL of modRNA, NFATc1 expression in human macrophages increased by 1.20 ± 0.08-fold, 3.47 ± 1.02-fold, and 13.31 ± 3.96-fold, respectively. Transfection with 25 or 50 ng/mL of NFATc1 modRNA for 3 days induced the formation of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive multinucleated cells, the F-actin ring formation, expression of cathepsin K, and increased bone resorption activity. Scanning electron micrographs confirmed the presence of round, multinucleated cells with projecting microvilli, characteristic of osteoclasts. In conclusion, rapid generation of functional osteoclast-like cells was achieved in vitro using NFATc1 modRNA. This method offers faster results compared with conventional receptor activator of nuclear factor-ĸB ligand stimulation.",
    "Stable isotope evidence of anthropocene disruption in African softshell turtle foraging.. de Kock W, van der Meer MTJ, van Bommel R, Taurozzi AJ, Von Tersch M, Allentoft ME, Mackie M, Ramsøe M, Collins M, Alexander M, Palsbøll PJ, Çakırlar C, Turkozan O (2026). We examined the dietary habits of contemporary and Middle to Late Holocene (ancient) populations of African softshell turtles (Trionyx triunguis) from the northern Levant using stable isotope analysis (δ13C, δ15N, and δ34S) and ZooMS biomarker identification. Our study presents the first application of ZooMS to this taxon, facilitating species-level identification. Stable isotope values point to potential variation in T. triunguis diets, possibly reflecting changing ecosystem conditions. Modern turtles from the south-western Turkish coast exhibit relatively high δ15N values, but low δ13C values, likely influenced by human-provided carrion and agriculture-driven inputs. Ancient turtles (n = 4) from the Levant exhibit more diverse diets, with two individuals indicating a more pronounced marine foraging signature. These preliminary findings are consistent with increased anthropogenic influence on T. triunguis foraging in some regions. This study provides new biomolecular insights into the ecological history of T. triunguis, increasing our understanding of its (long-term) dietary plasticity and potential response to anthropogenic pressures.",
    "Lipid nanoparticle GM-CSF replacement for autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis.. Lian L, Jang B, Huayamares SG, Shakked A, Gentry K, Zenhausern R, Radmand A, Schrader Echeverri E, Parihar VC, Guerrero-Ferreira RC, Calkins R, Vanover D, Santangelo PJ, Kim H, Dahlman JE (2026). Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) deficiency drives autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (aPAP), a disease characterized by impaired macrophage-mediated clearance of pulmonary surfactants. Clinical data suggest that inhaled recombinant GM-CSF reduces symptoms in aPAP patients, providing a rationale for mRNA-based GM-CSF replacement therapies. However, these require effective mRNA delivery after nebulization. Here, we report the iterative in vivo design of a lipid nanoparticle, named nebulized lung delivery 2 (NLD2), that efficiently delivers mRNA after nebulization. NLD2 carrying GM-CSF mRNA transfected alveolar macrophages in vivo, leading to interleukin-10 pathway activation and subsequent surfactant lipoprotein clearance. In a preclinical disease model of aPAP, GM-CSF mRNA delivery reduced surfactant protein thickness more than recombinant GM-CSF. These data support continued exploration of nebulized lipid nanoparticle therapies for aPAP.",
    "Sequence type and strain-level detection of Klebsiella pneumoniae in culture-enriched bacterial metagenomes: comparative performance of mSWEEP and StrainGE bioinformatic tools.. Buczek DJ, Kabir W, Lindstedt K, Mäklin T, Thorpe HA, Suzuki Y, Corander J, Samuelsen Ø, Sundsfjord A (2026). Klebsiella pneumoniae is a major cause of human infections and is frequently associated with antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Carriage of K. pneumoniae in the gut is a major risk factor for infection and a reservoir for the spread of high-risk clonal lineages and associated AMR determinants. Accurate detection of K. pneumoniae at the subspecies level is therefore essential to better understand K. pneumoniae gut colonization ecology and clonal dissemination. We analysed two recently developed bioinformatic tools, mSWEEP and StrainGE, for sequence type (ST) detection of K. pneumoniae in culture-enriched sweep metagenomes compared to single-colony whole-genome sequencing (WGS). We show that both mSWEEP and StrainGE perform highly accurate ST detection, concordant with culture in 46/49 and 44/49 samples with WGS-detected single STs, respectively, as well as in 2/3 samples with two WGS-detected STs. Within-sample ST diversity was detected in 19 and 15 samples by mSWEEP and StrainGE, respectively, highlighting a major advantage of these tools over conventional single-colony WGS. StrainGE could also reconstruct accurate phylogenetic relationships between strains of the same ST for 2/3 different STs tested. Additionally, assembly of the genomes provides better resolution of ST detection by mSWEEP. Together, our results show that both mSWEEP and StrainGE are accurate tools for the detection and analysis of K. pneumoniae STs from mixed bacterial samples.",
    "Post-harvest pyrethroid drench and injection treatments for quarantine control of imported fire ant (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) colonies infesting field-grown nursery plants.. Oliver JB, Addesso KM, Oi DH, Youssef NN, O'Neal P, Atchison RA, Alexander LW, Weeks RD (2026). There is an imported fire ant (IFA) quarantine in the USA to prevent human assisted spread of the invasive, red IFA (Solenopsis invicta Buren), black IFA (Solenopsis richteri Forel), and the S. invicta × S. richteri hybrid. Quarantine regulated articles must be treated following approved protocols and must not be infested with IFA queens or reproducing colonies. Large, post-harvest field-grown nursery plants are an infestation risk because they are difficult to treat effectively with approved insecticide treatments of (i) immersing in chlorpyrifos or bifenthrin solutions, or (ii) thoroughly drenching root balls with chlorpyrifos. To improve quarantine treatments, the efficacies of drenching and injecting (D&I) large (60 cm diameter) root balls with bifenthrin or lambda-cyhalothrin to disinfest them of IFA were determined and compared with chlorpyrifos drench (standard), and water drench (control). Bifenthrin and lambda-cyhalothrin D&I treatments eliminated all IFA colonies in 2 wk, while >70% of the chlorpyrifos drench-only and control root balls were infested. Bioassays of red IFA female alates (surrogates of colony founding queens) in soil sampled from various root ball positions receiving the above treatments resulted in no survival of alates exposed to bifenthrin after 10 d. With lambda-cyhalothrin and chlorpyrifos, 10% and 11% of the soil samples had ≥1 surviving alate, respectively. The complete IFA colony disinfestation of root balls and the death of all alates in soil samples indicated bifenthrin D&I could provide additional and effective quarantine level control of IFA in large, post-harvest field-grown nursery plants.",
    "A phase II trial of naxitamab plus stepped-up dosing of GM-CSF for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma in second or later complete remission.. Kushner BH, Modak S, White C, Basu EM, Roberts SS, Mauguen A, Cheung NV (2026). Relapse of high-risk neuroblastoma (HR-NB) poses a challenge to cure. Increasing numbers of HR-NB patients achieve post-relapse complete remission (CR) because close monitoring can detect localized disease and novel effective salvage therapies have emerged. We report outcome with immunotherapy using the anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) naxitamab and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) for consolidation of second or later CR in a phase II trial (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01757626). Cycles included GM-CSF 250 μg/m2/day on days -4-to-0 and increased to 500 μg/m2/day on days +1-to-5, and 3 doses of naxitamab infused (30-to-90 min) on days +1/+3/+5, 3 mg/kg/infusion (9 mg/kg/cycle, i.e., ~270 mg/m2/cycle). Cycles were monthly ×5. Clinical factors assessed regarding prognosis were: MYCN amplification; localized versus widespread prior relapse; 1 versus ≥2 prior relapse(s); previous treatment with anti-GD2 mAb; and time from diagnosis to 1st relapse. Sixty patients were enrolled after 1 (n = 42) or ≥2 (n = 18) prior relapse(s); 27 (45%) had MYCN amplification. Progression-free survival (PFS) rates at 2/5 years were 55%/50%. Prior treatment with naxitamab and prior widespread relapse had significant negative impacts on PFS. Post-protocol patients in CR routinely received an investigational anti-NB vaccine. Two other patients, both with 1 prior relapse, took DFMO. Naxitamb+GM-CSF is a good option to consolidate post-relapse CR of HR-NB. The encouraging long-term outcome cannot be attributed solely to naxitamab+GM-CSF given post-protocol therapies.",
    "Social implications of human food subsidies on wildlife populations.. Beck KB, Cantor M, Farine DR, Mueller T (2026). Human activities generate a variety of novel food sources that wild animals exploit. On land and in water, these human-derived foods can profoundly alter intraspecific interactions in wildlife with cascading effects on population dynamics and ecosystem functioning. Yet, despite their growing ecological relevance, the role of human food subsidies in shaping intraspecific interactions remains underexplored. We propose a novel framework that captures how key characteristics of human food subsidies-such as high abundance, predictability, increased proximity to humans and dietary composition-modify social interactions. Specifically, we discuss how individual-level changes in fitness, time allocation, movement and social choices can shape interactions and the resulting social network properties, both directly and indirectly through alterations in population size, density and composition. Finally, we outline the ecological and evolutionary consequences of these social changes, including impacts on the transmission of diseases, stress and information, as well as on selection and development. Collectively, these alterations highlight the broad social implications that intentional and unintentional human food subsidies can have for ecological and evolutionary processes in wildlife populations.",
    "Range-extending fish become competitive dominants under ocean warming but not heatwaves or acidification.. Mitchell A, Coni EOC, Connell SD, Booth DJ, Harvey BP, Agostini S, Ravasi T, Nagelkerken I (2026). Ocean warming is driving species range extensions into cooler regions. The direct physiological influence of warming on species performance can accelerate such extensions into novel ecosystems; however, indirect effects of invader-resident interactions in cooler regions may counter these positive effects. Here, we examined the foraging performance and densities of competing warm-water and cool-water fishes across a latitudinal temperature gradient spanning 1500 km from tropical to temperate reefs subjected to rapid ocean warming in the southern hemisphere, and across natural analogs of temperate, tropicalized, and acidified reef localities in the northern hemisphere, and during a severe marine heatwave at a temperate reef. While current levels of ocean warming have allowed the warm-water fish to extend their ranges into temperate ecosystems at both hemispheres, their foraging performance was reduced at both the cold- and warm-temperate reefs compared to the (sub)tropical reefs. However, at the (warmer) tropicalized reef, the warm-water fish had higher foraging performance and maintained densities, even under extreme pH reduction, compared to the temperate reef. In contrast, the cool-water species struggled at the warmer tropicalized and extreme reefs with reduced foraging performance and lower population densities compared to the temperate reef. Contrastingly, the severe heatwave experienced at the temperate reef did not alter the foraging behaviors of either species. We suggest that ocean warming boosts the foraging performance of the range-extending warm-water fish and impairs that of their cool-water competitor at temperate reefs, irrespective of acidification and heatwaves, leading to a shift in dominance hierarchies on temperate reefs. We conclude that warming-driven increases in foraging performance of the warm-water species may alleviate foraging limitations and enhance its establishment at its leading range edges under climate change, to the detriment of its cool-water competitors.",
    "Ovulatory follicular fluid promotes the clonogenicity and invasion of ectopic and eutopic endometrial cells.. Hsu CF, Seenan V, Manickam S, Wang LY, Chang YC, Chen YH, Ding DC, Chen PC, Chu TY (2026). OBJECTIVES: Endometriosis is a chronic, estrogen-dependent disorder characterized by the ectopic growth of endometrial-like tissue. Despite its significant impact on fertility and quality of life, the pathogenesis of endometriosis remains poorly understood. This study investigates the potential role of ovulatory follicular fluid (FF) in driving disease progression. Based on the \"double engines theory,\" which posits that retrograde menstruation provides the \"seeds\" for ectopic lesions while ovulation fuels their growth, we hypothesize that FF enhances endometrial cell proliferation, clonogenicity, migration, and invasion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Primary eutopic and ectopic endometrial cells were isolated from infertile women and treated with 10% diluted FF collected from in vitro fertilization patients. Cellular morphology, proliferation, clonogenicity, migration, and invasion were evaluated using colony formation, transwell, and Matrigel assays. Statistical analyses were performed to compare cellular responses between eutopic and ectopic cells. RESULTS: Morphological analysis revealed distinct adaptive changes, with ectopic cells predominantly adopting a more fibroblast-like phenotype. Ectopic cells exhibited higher clonogenicity (29.8-fold) capacities, lower proliferation (0.49-fold) and migration (0.11-fold) capacities, and similar invasion capabilities compared to eutopic cells. FF significantly enhanced proliferation (1.7-fold in eutopic and 1.3-fold in ectopic cells) and clonogenic capacity, with eutopic cells forming 31.3 times more colonies and ectopic cells showing a 1.3-fold increase. The clonogenic area expanded dramatically, increasing 261-fold in eutopic and 4.9-fold in ectopic cells. In addition, FF promoted migration (1.8-fold in eutopic and 2.9-fold in ectopic cells) and invasion (9.1-fold in eutopic and 4.8-fold in ectopic cells). These findings suggest that FF may play a pivotal role in the early establishment and progression of ectopic lesions. CONCLUSION: The results highlight the critical role of FF in enhancing endometrial cell survival, proliferation, and dissemination. This supports the \"double engines theory\" of endometriosis, emphasizing the significant contribution of ovulation to the pathogenesis of the disease.",
    "Long noncoding RNA LOC441461 drives cancer growth and is associated with poor clinical outcomes.. Cheng CF, Tu YT, Chen YR, Lee MC, Ku HC, Tsai KW (2026). OBJECTIVES: The role of LOC441461, a long noncoding RNA, differs in different cancer types, and its role in lung cancer remains unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the clinical significance of LOC441461 expression in lung cancer using bioinformatics analyses. To explore the biological function of LOC441461, we performed siRNA-mediated knockdown in lung cancer cells and evaluated its effects on cell proliferation, colony formation, apoptosis, and cell cycle progression. RESULTS: LOC441461 was found to be significantly overexpressed in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), and LOC441461 overexpression was significantly associated with poor prognosis in patients with LUAD. LOC441461 knockdown significantly inhibited cell growth and induced a modest but statistically significant increase in apoptosis in lung cancer cells. According to a cell cycle analysis, LOC441461 knockdown induced G0/G1 arrest in A549 cells; increased p21 and p27 expression; and reduced the levels of CDK4 and the cyclins A2, B1, and D1, similar to p53-dependent regulation. By contrast, H1299 cells exhibited G2/M accumulation with no change in p21 and p27 levels, suggesting a p53-independent mechanism. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that high LOC441461 expression is correlated with worse prognosis in LUAD. These results support the potential of LOC441461 as a novel therapeutic and prognostic target in LUAD.",
    "Combination of EGCG and BH3 Mimetic Inhibitor Enhances Apoptosis of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 Cancer Cells.. Miri ZS, Bagheri H, Amani A, Karami H (2025). BACKGROUND: Elevated levels of myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1) have been shown to counteract the proapoptotic effects of ABT-737, thereby promoting cell survival and contributing to treatment resistance in tumors. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) on the expression of Mcl-1 and the sensitivity of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells to ABT-737. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cell toxicity was assessed through the implementation of the MTT assay. To evaluate the impact of treatments on cell proliferation, both the cell growth assay and the colony formation assay were employed. The mRNA levels of Mcl-1 and matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) were measured using quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. In order to assess cell migration, the wound healing assay was utilized. The presence of apoptosis was detected through various methods, including ELISA cell death assay, caspase-3 activity assay, and Hoechst 33342 staining. RESULTS: Combined EGCG and ABT-737 significantly reduced IC50 values and suppressed colony formation, migration, and survival in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells more effectively than either agent alone. EGCG downregulated Mcl-1 and MMP-2 mRNA expression. Critically, EGCG-mediated Mcl-1 suppression enhanced ABT-737-induced apoptosis. This synergy highlights EGCG's role in overcoming ABT-737 resistance via Mcl-1 inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: EGCG has been shown to possess antitumor properties in breast cancer cells. Moreover, EGCG has the potential to enhance the apoptotic effects of ABT-737 by suppressing the expression of Mcl-1.",
    "MiR-424-5p acts as an oncogene in Hep3B cells by activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.. Ding Z, Qi S, Hu M, Wang L, Tang Y, Sun J, Zheng L, Li Y, Li L, Ma Q, Tang H (2025). Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a global health challenge with high morbidity and mortality. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play pivotal roles in cancer progression, yet their context-dependent functions in HBV-HCC are unclear. This study demonstrates that miR-424-5p is significantly upregulated in HBV positive Hep3B cells, correlating with poor patient prognosis. Integrated bioinformatic analysis predicted that the target genes of miR-424-5p are significantly enriched in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Functional experiments showed that knockdown of miR-424-5p suppressed cell proliferation, migration, and colony formation. Mechanistically, miR-424-5p knockdown led to the upregulation of PTEN and downregulation of phosphorylated PI3K/AKT, indicating inhibition of this pathway. These findings unveil an oncogenic role of miR-424-5p in HBV-HCC, suggesting its function is driven by viral specific dysregulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway, with PTEN involvement. Our study highlights miR-424-5p as a potential therapeutic target and provides insights into etiology-specific miRNA regulatory networks.",
    "Circular RNA hsa-circ-0001030 suppresses proliferation and cisplatin tolerance in TSCC via interaction with PKM2.. Yang H, Yan Y, Tan Z, Xu X, Chen K, Li Q, Liufu N, Ji F (2026). Aim: Cisplatin resistance remains a major obstacle to the effective treatment of tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC). This study is dedicated to elucidating the role and mechanism of circular RNA (circRNA) hsa-circ-0001030 in modulating cisplatin sensitivity and metabolic reprogramming in TSCC. Methods: CircRNA sequencing, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization were used to test hsa-circ-0001030 expression in TSCC tissues and cell lines. Gain-of-function assays (colony formation, cell counting kit-8, Transwell assay, and xenograft models) were conducted to evaluate proliferation, invasion, and cisplatin response. Mechanistic studies, including RNA pull-down, RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation, and western blotting, were performed to identify pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) as a binding partner of hsa-circ-0001030 and to assess glycolytic activity, glucose uptake, and lactate production. Results: Hsa-circ-0001030 was markedly downregulated in TSCC and cisplatin-resistant cells. Overexpression of hsa-circ-0001030 suppressed tumor growth, migration, and glycolytic flux, while enhancing cisplatin sensitivity both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, hsa-circ-0001030 directly bound to PKM2 at nucleotides 138-169, inhibited PKM2 enzymatic activity, restraining tetramer formation and increased tyrosine 105 (Tyr105) phosphorylation and thereby blocking PKM2-driven glycolysis. Clinically, low hsa-circ-0001030 expression correlated with advanced tumor-node-metastasis stage, poor differentiation, and unsatisfying prognosis in TSCC patients. Conclusion: Hsa-circ-0001030 acted as a tumor-suppressive circRNA that might depress PKM2-dependent metabolic reprogramming and cisplatin resistance in TSCC, highlighting its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for overcoming chemoresistance.",
    "Odor tracking in insects: a multisensory behavior.. Soman S, Ramaswamy SS, Sane SP (2026). Insects rely on sophisticated odor-tracking mechanisms to locate mates and food sources, or follow conspecific trails, in both two (e.g. substrate-based tracking by ants and termites) and three (e.g. airborne pheromone plume tracking by flying insects) dimensions. These behaviors rely on the integration of multisensory information and understanding them requires us to draw upon principles from odor transport physics, odor chemistry and sensory ecology. Airborne odor plumes are typically heterogeneous and turbulent, delivering chemical cues in intermittent bursts, while ground-based odor trails are more stable and localized. Hence, insects employ fundamentally distinct strategies to navigate these environments, shaped by the physical and chemical properties of the odorants. Insect odor-tracking behavior is mediated by an array of sensory modalities, including chemosensory, visual, mechanosensory and thermal inputs. Experimental approaches in both laboratory and field settings have revealed how insects integrate these cues to successfully identify odor sources under complex environmental conditions. Comparative studies, such as those examining diurnal versus nocturnal tracking, highlight how sensory prioritization shifts with ecological context, revealing adaptive neural integration mechanisms. This article reviews the behavioral strategies insects use for odor tracking in air and on the ground, focusing on the role of multisensory integration and the vulnerability of these behaviors to sensory noise. Emerging research on environmental disruptions, such as artificial light at night and air pollution, highlights the ecological threats to odor-mediated behaviors. By synthesizing insights from diverse insect taxa, we examine how sensory noise and anthropogenic change can impair essential behaviors such as foraging and mating.",
    "Vision in flower foraging butterflies: from functional organization of the retina to encoding in the brain.. Kinoshita M, Arikawa K (2026). The swallowtail butterfly Papilio xuthus is a model species in insect vision science, thanks to extensive studies over the past few decades. P. xuthus adaptively uses visual cues such as color, brightness, polarization and motion in various steps of flower-foraging behavior. We have explored these visual functions from both perceptual and physiological perspectives. This Review aims to summarize these studies by focusing on color vision as a prominent ability in foraging P. xuthus and on wide-field motion vision as a more-universal visual modality in insects. The compound eyes of P. xuthus consist of three types of ommatidia, each with a different combination of spectral receptor classes: sensitive to ultraviolet (UV), violet (V), blue (B), green (G), red (R) and broadband (BB) wavelength regions. Connectome analysis of the first optic ganglion, the lamina, reveals interphotoreceptor interaction causing spectral opponency and spectral integration in the second-order lamina monopolar cells (LMCs). These characteristics should be crucial in the initial processing underlying the acute color discrimination ability of tetrachromatic color vision based on UV, B, G and R receptors, as well as motion vision involving G, R and BB receptors. In addition, we have revealed that the spectral properties of interneurons connecting the optic lobe and the central brain well explain the behavioral properties of P. xuthus. By discussing the visual system of P. xuthus butterflies in conjunction with knowledge from honeybees, flies and other lepidopteran insects, we will provide valuable insights into the evolution of insect visual systems.",
    "Anatomical and functional specialization of the soldier caste in a heterophyid trematode, Cercaria batillariae.. Miura K, Wada S, Miura O (2026). The presence of a soldier caste is a hallmark of the reproductive division of labour. Trematodes reproduce asexually and form a colony in snails, the first intermediate host. Several trematode species produce morphologically and behaviourally specialized soldiers for defending colony members. These soldiers often possess disproportionately large pharynxes, which serve as a weapon for sucking and attacking their enemies. Here, we demonstrate further anatomical and functional specialization in trematode soldiers. We found that Cercaria batillariae HL7 exhibits the reproductive division of labour with reproductive and soldier castes. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that the pharynxes of the soldiers were not just larger than those of the reproductives but were covered by a tegument with serrated projections, coupled with thick bundles of radial muscle fibres, consistent with enhancing the role of soldiers in attaching to and sucking on enemies with their mouths and pharynxes. These sucker structures are analogous to those seen in octopuses. The TEM images further revealed that at least some soldiers of C. batillariae lack a germinal mass, suggesting they are at least temporarily sterile. Our study facilitates the understanding of the trematode social system by providing fine-scale structural differences between the reproductive and soldier castes.",
    "Stuck in space but not in time: multiple-scale resource selection in a stationary prey.. May R, Jackson CR, Wanda J, Fyumagwa R, Bevanger K, Røskaft E (2026). BACKGROUND: Prey species need to adjust their habitat selection either temporally or spatially to reduce predation risk or human disturbance. We tested the risk allocation hypothesis that poses that foraging is higher in low-risk habitats and during low-risk periods for impala (Aepyceros melampus) in the Serengeti Ecosystem. We expected impalas to select ranges that balance long-term predation risk and forage availability and adjust their habitat utilization within their ranges temporally to balance short-term predation risk and energy intake. METHODS: We modelled multi-scale resource selection for 36 GPS-tracked impala (2016-2018) to disentangle spatial and temporal trade-offs between forage acquisition and predation risk using resource selection functions at the landscape and within-home-range level. We contrasted resource selection inside and outside of Serengeti NP (SNP) for woody cover, forage availability (vegetation heterogeneity, NDVI) and risky places (proximity to water, terrain ruggedness). We also modelled responses to diel and lunar cycles in space use. RESULTS: Impalas attuned their resource selection both towards maximizing forage availability and minimizing risk exposure, especially at the landscape level. While home-ranges were generally placed in more homogeneous woodland close to water sources, impalas preferred to use more heterogeneous, open and rugged patches within their home-ranges. They adjusted their responses outside SNP by placing their home-ranges in less rugged terrain and farther from water sources. Impalas balanced foraging and risk temporally by adjusting their preferences to circalunar and diel patterns. CONCLUSIONS: Impala attuned their home-range placement and utilization according to the 'landscape of fear' hypothesis inhabiting a 'squeezed' landscape. Here, prey to a functionally diverse carnivore guild clearly balanced their space use between food acquisition and spatio-temporal risk avoidance. Humans, however, acted as a 'super-predator' eliciting a stronger behavioural response compared to natural predators. Following the risk allocation hypothesis, the presence of humans was of such an intensity and predictability that it changed the anti-predator responses in impala compared to the adjacent natural system with carnivores only. A functional response in habitat selection indicated that impala avoided long-term spatial risk in home-range placement, while within their home-ranges short-term temporal risk mimicked the diel patterns observed within the protected area with natural predators only.",
    "Neonatal sleep physiology and early executive functioning in preterm children.. Dereymaeker A, Hermans T, Bollen B, Jansen K, Ortibus E, De Vos M, Naulaers G, Neonatal Sleep Talks (NEST) group (2026). BACKGROUND: Executive functioning (EF) deficits are frequently observed in preterms. EF development is linked to the prefrontal cortex and sleep-regulating homeostatic processes. As sleep is an essential driver of early brain maturation, curtailment of sleep in the NICU may be unfavorable. This study examined whether neonatal sleep behavior influences EF at 2 years corrected age in preterm children. METHODS: 76 preterm infants ( < 34 weeks gestation and/or 1500 g) underwent overnight polysomnography before discharge. Sleep stages-Total Sleep Time, Active Sleep (AS), Quiet Sleep (QS) and Transitional Sleep-were quantified using an automated sleep algorithm. EF was assessed at 2 years corrected age, focusing on spatial working memory, cognitive flexibility, and inhibitory control. General linear models were used, adjusting for confounders. RESULTS: More Total Sleep Time was significantly associated with higher overall EF scores, and the subtest for spatial working memory. AS and QS durations were influenced by postmenstrual age. Longer AS bouts were linked to increased Total Sleep Time. However, individual AS or QS percentages were not directly associated with EF. Higher levels of Transitional Sleep were related to lower EF performance. CONCLUSIONS: Neonatal sleep duration is positively associated with better EF outcomes at 2 years. Protecting sleep in the NICU may support early brain development and executive functioning. IMPACT: This study links objective neonatal sleep measurements-using polysomnography and automated sleep staging-with later executive functioning development in preterm children. Neonatal sleep duration, particularly Total Sleep Time, is positively associated with executive functioning at 2 years in children born preterm. This study highlights neonatal sleep as a potential early marker of altered brain development. The findings support the importance of protecting and improving sleep in the NICU as a possible modifiable factor that could enhance early brain maturation and neurodevelopment.",
    "Real-world evaluat ion of hybrid Green AI for sustainable and efficient smart supply chain distribution.. Hassouna MA, Aboutabl AE, Diaa NM, Haggag RY (2026). This paper proposes a hybrid Green AI framework for achieving sustainable physical distribution in smart supply chains. The framework integrates real-world geospatial data, multi-objective optimization, and meta-inference algorithms. It aims to reduce transportation costs, delivery times, fuel consumption, and CO₂ emissions while maintaining operational efficiency, in line with Sustainable Development Goals 11 and 13. The new MOIAC algorithm enhances ant colony optimization by incorporating environmental weighting into pheromone updates. Real-world validation utilizes Google Maps API data from 19 Egyptian cities, with demand modeled using a Zipf distribution (α = 0.9). OR tools serve as a high-fidelity proxy to simulate the performance of MOIAC and MOIPS under real-world conditions. The results show a 26.7% reduction in total distance, operating costs, and CO₂ emissions compared to baseline methods, with MOIAC achieving the lowest average response time (120 ms). Comparisons with six algorithms—including Greedy, PSO, ACO, and Genetic—confirm the superiority of the proposed approach. This framework demonstrates how green AI and geospatial intelligence can contribute to theoretical optimization and practical logistics, providing a scalable, environmentally friendly, and operationally efficient solution for modern supply chain distribution.",
    "Trait-mediated effects of anthropogenic noise on bird behaviour and fitness.. Madden NL, Mills KL, Alofs KM, Francis CD, Carter NH (2026). Birds are considered especially vulnerable to anthropogenic noise because of their reliance on acoustic information. Single-species research shows that noise can impact different aspects of bird behaviour and consequently reduce their fitness. However, we have a limited understanding of how ecological and life-history traits mediate responses to anthropogenic noise across species. We performed a meta-analysis to quantify noise impacts on bird behaviours (communication, cognition, aggression, risk, foraging and habitat use) and fitness-related responses (growth, physiology and reproduction), and how bird traits, such as nesting and habitat type, mediated those responses. Using 944 effect sizes from 160 bird species across six continents, we found that anthropogenic noise significantly affected various behaviours as well as physiology and had strong negative effects on reproductive responses. We also found that anthropogenic noise had stronger negative effects on bird reproduction for species that nest nearer to the ground, while growth and physiological responses were stronger for species that nested in open rather than cavity nests and those living in deciduous forests, respectively. Our results highlight the characteristics of those birds most vulnerable to noise pollution and inform how conservation actions can best reduce the impacts of human-made noise in those species' habitats.",
    "Tuning regimes in ant foraging dynamics depend on the existence of bistability.. Lynch CM, Daniels BC (2026). Characterizing how behaviour must be tuned to produce useful coordination is key to understanding the evolution and regulation of collective behaviour. While computational models can answer this for specific cases, recurring patterns in model dynamics suggest a more general means of classifying collective dynamics. Using ant foraging models as an example, we investigate mechanisms that produce symmetry-breaking transitions to bistability as a first basic classification. Collective transitions are functionally important: they lead to sudden changes in collective states, enhanced sensitivity to environmental inputs and hysteresis. We use bifurcation theory to argue that the point where discontinuous transitions merge at a continuous transition forms a codimension-2 bifurcation with universal properties, functionally equivalent to the critical point of a phase diagram. We show how analogous bistable transitions appear across ant foraging models with different mechanistic assumptions and explore biologically relevant effects near the transition. This framework clarifies the difficulty of tuning collective behaviour: locating a continuous transition typically requires tuning two parameters, while a discontinuous transition requires only one. Finally, we explore conditions that degrade or destroy bistability: heterogeneity blurs transitions, while recruitment without positive feedback produces no bistability.",
    "Trichomonas spp. Prevalence in Nestling Peregrine Falcons (Falco peregrinus) in Kentucky, USA, 2005-23, and Effects on Survival.. Slankard KG, Patton MD, Purple KE, Gerhold R (2026). The Peregrine Falcon (Falco peregrinus) is a species of conservation interest throughout much of eastern North America, and management efforts for the species are widespread. Peregrines are at risk for exposure to Trichomonas spp. because of their tendency to take pigeons and doves (Columbiformes) as prey. We investigated the prevalence of Trichomonas spp. in wild nestling Peregrine Falcons banded in nests in Kentucky, USA. We tested throat swabs collected from 266 Peregrine Falcons during 2005-23. A total of 21 birds tested positive for Trichomonas spp.; none of the falcons that tested positive were resighted as adults. We treated a subset of nestlings for Trichomonas spp. infection, including two in the nest (without removal), two nestlings temporarily removed from the nest for treatment, and 10 placed with wildlife rehabilitators for treatment. Rehabilitated nestlings were released at an age of ≥75 d. However, we did not confirm any benefits to survival from treatment. Trichomonosis may hinder Peregrine Falcon nestling survival in certain areas, especially urban locations.",
    "Apigenin Sensitizes Melanoma to Chemo/Radiotherapy and Potentiates Immune Killing by Reducing T Cell PD-1 Expression.. Yang G, Lv J, Dai M, Zhang Y, Long Y, Wang F, Zaky MY, Zhang Y, Liu H, Liu S, Zhang Y, Hu Z, Xu L (2026). Preclinical and clinical studies have suggested that combination therapies could potentially lead to further improved clinical outcomes of melanoma. This study aimed to explore the effects and mechanisms of apigenin combination with chemotherapy or radiotherapy in suppressing melanoma. Colony formation, immunofluorescence, flow cytometric analysis, and apoptosis assay were used to detect the effects of apigenin, DTIC, irradiation, or apigenin combined with DTIC or irradiation in melanoma cells. Western blot analysis and semi-quantitative PCR were used to measure the levels of PD-1 protein and PDCD1 mRNA. Cycloheximide chase assays, PS-341, and chloroquine treatment were used to explore the mechanisms of PD-1 downregulatory effects by apigenin. Killing assay was used to assess the killing effects of combination therapies against melanoma cells. In vivo experiments were generated to investigate the impact of combination therapy on tumor growth and immune infiltration. We found that combination treatment was more effective in inhibiting colony formation and Ki-67 expression in melanoma cells. Combination treatment caused stronger cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phases and enhanced cellular apoptosis than monotherapies. Further, we observed that apigenin promoted the degradation of PD-1 in T cells via the proteasomal pathway. Killing assays showed that the combination treatment demonstrated significantly enhanced T cell-mediated killing. In vivo experiments confirmed that combined treatment noticeably inhibited melanoma growth and enhanced T cell infiltration into melanoma tissues. Apigenin promoted the degradation of PD-1 in T cells via the proteasomal pathway, in addition to synergizing with chemo/radiotherapy to inhibit melanoma growth.",
    "Traveling Wave Formation Enables Strain Coexistence in a Spatial Model of Bacterial Cross-Feeding.. Pakzad P, DeAngelis D (2026). Cross-feeding is a form of metabolic cooperation in microbial populations where one species or strain produces a byproduct that serves as a nutrient for another. This interaction can promote division of labor, resource efficiency, and species coexistence. The extent to which spatial heterogeneity and metabolite diffusion shape cross-feeding interactions is not yet well resolved. In this study, we examine the spatial dynamics of cross-feeding between two bacterial strains using a two-dimensional chemostat lattice model. Both strains are capable of growing on glucose and acetate, but differ in resource preference. One, which we term glucose specialist, primarily consumes glucose, while the other, which we term acetate specialist, primarily consumes acetate. Moreover, elevated acetate amount inhibits the growth of both strains. Metabolite dynamics are governed by reaction-diffusion equations, and bacterial motility is implemented through partially random local dispersal rules. Our simulations reveal that the emergence of traveling waves plays a critical role in enabling long-term coexistence of the two strains. Specifically, clusters of glucose specialists self-organize into wave-like structures that propagate toward regions of elevated acetate amount. These traveling waves suppress inhibitory acetate level ahead of the front, creating favorable conditions in their wake for the acetate specialists to grow. The resulting spatiotemporal patterns-characterized by merging wave fronts and sequential colonization-allow both strains to persist over the long term, despite competitive and inhibitory interactions. Mathematical analysis is used to support and interpret the simulation results. These findings demonstrate how spatial self-organization and reaction-diffusion dynamics can mediate coexistence in microbial cross-feeding systems, offering new insights into the ecological and evolutionary stability of microbial communities.",
    "Comparative morphology of the labial gland in Formicidae.. Zhang L, He X, Ma R, He H (2026). The labial gland is an important exocrine gland in ants and is thought to contribute to food processing and trophallaxis. In this study, the morphology of the labial gland was examined in 12 species from 4 subfamilies-Ponerinae, Formicinae, Dolichoderinae, and Myrmicinae-using light and electron microscopy (SEM, TEM). Our results reveal that gland morphology is more similar among closely related species, suggesting a stronger correlation with phylogeny than with diet. The morphology also appears to relate to social behavior, particularly trophallaxis. Formicine species, which rely heavily on trophallaxis, possessed the largest relative reservoir size, whereas the two examined myrmicine species, which have reservoirs absent, are known to rely little or not at all on this behavior. Ultrastructural observations showed abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum in all species, indicating protein-rich secretions in the labial gland. Ponerine species displayed the acinar type, characterized by short microvilli in the apical cell region and a ramified canaliculi system that delivers secretion to the duct. Species from other subfamilies exhibited the tubular type, with long apical microvilli that increase the apical surface and appear to facilitate secretion discharge. This study provides new comparative data on labial gland morphology and reveals potential phylogenetic, behavioral, and ecological variation that will require further study to confirm and fully understand.",
    "Comprehensive pharmacokinetics and metabolite profiling of the novel anti-tumor polypeptide CPP-4-2 in rats using UHPLC-MS/MS.. Zhu A, Ma S, Cao J, Li P, Liu R, He B (2026). CPP-4-2, a novel anti-tumor peptide, has been shown to disrupt tumor growth by competitively binding to Staphylococcal nuclease domain-containing protein 1 (SND1), inducing its degradation and inhibiting the SND1-Metadherin (MTDH) interaction. Despite the established efficacy of this approach, comprehensive in vivo analytical methodologies remain limited. Therefore, based on the physicochemical characteristics of CPP-4-2, its anti-hepatocellular carcinoma activity was confirmed using CCK-8, colony formation, and cell migration assays. A comprehensive quality standard for CPP-4-2, encompassing description, identification, tests, assay, and related substances, was established, alongside a validated HPLC method for in vitro quantification. Additionally, a highly sensitive, specific, reproducible, and rapid UHPLC-QTRAP-MS/MS method for in vivo CPP-4-2 quantification was developed and fully validated, meeting the requirements for biological sample analysis in plasma, heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney tissues. Application of this method to SD rats following intravenous injection (10 mg/kg) revealed a rapid peak plasma concentration, followed by a swift decline, indicating a primary efficacy window of 0-2 h. 16 metabolites, including the parent compound, were identified using UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS. This study highlights the potential of CPP-4-2, establishes quality control, provides key in vivo data, and lays the foundation for further structural modifications, development of novel dosage forms, and investigations into safe medication practices.",
    "Inhibition of SDE2 promotes autophagy-dependent ferroptosis in multiple myeloma.. Xia L, Bao J, Chen XW, Zhao YC, Wang X, Zheng Y (2026). BACKGROUND: Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable plasma cell malignancy with high relapse rate. Recent studies have implicated dysregulated autophagy and ferroptosis in MM progression; however, the molecular links remain elusive. This study investigated the role of SDE2, a ubiquitin-like protein overexpressed in MM, in modulating autophagy-ferroptosis crosstalk via ATG5 degradation with the aim of identifying novel therapeutic targets. METHODS: Using bioinformatic analysis of TCGA data, we identified SDE2 as a prognostic marker in MM. Functional validation included Western blot, co-immunoprecipitation, and ubiquitination assays in MM cell lines (H929, RPMI8226, OPM-2, and KMS-11) and patient-derived samples. Transwell migration, soft agar colony formation, and flow cytometry were used to assess cellular phenotypes. In vivo efficacy was tested using xenograft models. RESULTS: SDE2 overexpression correlates with poor MM prognosis and promotes tumor cell survival, migration, and proliferation. Mechanistically, SDE2 binds to ATG5, facilitating K48-linked ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, thereby suppressing autophagy and ferroptosis. Knockdown of SDE2 restored ATG5 levels, reactivated autophagy, and sensitized MM cells to ferroptosis. Combined SDE2 silencing and pharmacological ATG5/7 activation (Antitumor agent-82) synergistically suppressed tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSION: The SDE2-ATG5 axis serves as a critical regulator of the autophagy-ferroptosis crosstalk in MM. Targeting SDE2 restores ATG5-dependent autophagy, activates ferroptosis, and inhibits tumor growth. These findings suggest a novel therapeutic strategy that combines SDE2 inhibitors with autophagy agonists, potentially offering clinical benefits in MM treatment. This study provides further insight into autophagy-dependent ferroptosis in other malignancies.",
    "Clinical utility of immature granulocyte monitoring for optimizing g-CSF use during chemotherapy-induced neutropenia.. Cizmecioglu A, Yaksi E, Selim C, Ciftciler R (2026). IntroductionProlonged neutropenia is a major complication of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia in hematologic malignancies, often leading to empirical and prolonged use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF). Immature granulocytes (IG) have recently been proposed as a surrogate marker of bone marrow recovery.ObjectivesThis study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of IG kinetics for neutropenia resolution and to explore its potential role in optimizing supportive pharmacotherapy.MethodA retrospective cohort of adult patients with hematologic malignancies treated between 2022 and 2024 was analyzed. Serial IG counts were extracted from automated complete blood counts during neutropenic episodes. Chemotherapy regimens were classified by myelosuppressive intensity, and subgroup analyses were conducted according to malignancy subtype and G-CSF administration. Temporal associations between IG elevation and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) recovery were examined, and predictive accuracy was assessed using ROC analysis.ResultsForty-five patients (mean age: 62.6 ± 14.2 years; 67% male) were included, of whom 82% had lymphoproliferative disorders. The median duration of neutropenia was 6 days (IQR: 3-12), shorter among those receiving G-CSF and with lymphoid malignancies. IG elevation significantly preceded or coincided with ANC recovery (median lag: 0 days) and showed high predictive accuracy (AUC: 0.91-0.98).ConclusionIG kinetics were predictive of neutropenia recovery and may serve as an early, low-cost biomarker to guide the discontinuation or de-escalation of G-CSF. Integrating IG monitoring into clinical decision-making could improve supportive pharmacotherapy in patients with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia.",
    "Dynamic feedback control of oncogenic tyrosine kinase signaling in acute leukemia.. Lee J, Sun R, Kume K, Robinson ME, Cheng Z, Cosgun KN, Ma N, Hurtz C, Geng H, Luger SM, Litzow MR, Paietta E, Chen J, Vaidehi N, Müschen M (2026). CD25 is a subunit of the interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor on T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Acute leukemias with oncogenic tyrosine kinases often include CD25+ leukemia subpopulations, which portend poor clinical outcomes for patients; however, acute leukemia cells do not respond to IL-2. Here, we identified CD25 and its phosphorylation by protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ) as central elements of a feedback loop that stabilized fluctuations in oncogenic tyrosine kinase signaling in acute lymphoblastic and myeloid leukemia. Genetic ablation of CD25 in murine and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of acute leukemias reduced clonal fitness, colony formation, and leukemia-initiation capacity in serial transplant recipients. Oncogenic tyrosine kinase signaling in leukemia cells stimulated NF-κB-mediated CD25 expression, whereas PKCδ-mediated phosphorylation of CD25 suppressed oncogenic tyrosine kinase signaling through inhibitory phosphatases, such as PTPN6. Interactome analyses and mass spectrometry-based global phosphoproteomic analyses showed that CD25 deletion abolished the phosphatase activity of PTPN6, resulting in enhanced activation of tyrosine kinases and NF-κB. Four injections of a CD25 antibody-drug conjugate induced complete remission in mice transplanted with PDX refractory leukemia. These findings highlight the dependency of tyrosine kinase-driven leukemias on robust feedback control and the role of PKCδ and CD25 in assembling its components.",
    "Identifying optimal combination regimens for therapy of Mycobacterium tuberculosis with an algorithmic approach: prospective predictions and validations.. Louie A, Neely M, Kim S, Scanga CA, Flynn JL, Peloquin CA, Prideaux B, Schmidt S, Almoslem M, Yamada W, Drusano G (2026). BACKGROUND: Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistance to standard-of-care agents is increasing. It is imperative to identify new combinations that increase the rate and depth of bacterial kill, shorten therapy and also suppress resistance. There has been little prior effort to identify combination regimens that employ new or repurposed drugs in a rational way. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Our group developed a pathway to combine agents to achieve this end. This pathway starts with standard baseline evaluations (e.g., MIC), leverages information from in vitro assessments (hollow fiber infection model), then analyzes 2-agent combinations in a 96 well quantitative culture checkerboard format (Greco URSA model with simulation). Finally, development of a high dimensional mathematical model allowed evaluation of 2- and 3-drug regimens in multiple metabolic states to draw inferences regarding combination therapies. We prospectively evaluated these regimens in animal models. We showed that a prospectively chosen regimen of pretomanid, moxifloxacin plus bedaquiline performed as predicted. In the BALB/c murine model, this regimen produced sterilization in a cohort that was held for 12 weeks after therapy cessation, as it did in the C3HeB/FeJ (\"Kramnik\") murine model. Finally, this and other regimens were evaluated in a cynomolgus macaque model. The decrement of the 18F-deoxyglucose signal in Positron emission tomography (PET)- computed tomography (CT) evaluations was best with this regimen. Other endpoints such as necropsy score and colony counts in lung and lymph nodes also demonstrated that this regimen behaved as predicted from our pathway/algorithm. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that this provides a way forward for the future to identify the most promising regimens to shorten therapy for tuberculosis and suppress emergence of resistance.",
    "Reduction and Refinement of Genetically Altered Mouse Breeding: Controlling Quality and Quantity According to Experimental Needs.. Mesbah K, Ayadi A (2026). The mouse is currently the most widely used animal model for scientific research worldwide. In Europe, statistical data show that half of all mice used in research are genetically modified, and that 60% of the transgenic mice produced are ultimately not used. Optimizing production strategies is therefore essential to minimize the production of animals that will not be included in research. In this article, we examine the key components required for the rigorous management of genetically modified lines, organized under the acronym DOPPUME: Define, Obtain, Protect, Produce, Use, Manage, and Exchange. The first step is to clearly define the model in accordance with the scientific objective and strictly control its genetic characteristics, including both the genetic background and the engineered modification. Ensuring the stability of these parameters is crucial for maintaining continuity between studies and preventing genetic drift. The article also provides tools to support the clear definition of production goals based on planned experiments and to estimate production needs as accurately as possible, accounting for the types of crosses and breeding schemes involved. Emphasis is placed on producing only what is necessary and on implementing proactive, rather than reactive, colony management. This framework is fully aligned with the 3Rs principles (Replace, Reduce, Refine) by promoting a responsible, rational, and optimized use of mouse models in research. © 2026 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",
    "Milk Kefir Beverage Improves Histomorphometry, Reduces Inflammatory Infiltrates and Desulfovibrio and Increases Lactobacillus in IL-10(-/-) Mice.. Campos IX, Paris VF, Pereira MFA, Alpino GCÁ, Bernardes AL, Ávila LGM, Mishima MDV, Dias MMDS, Jangola STG, Mendes TAO, Peluzio MDCG (2026). This study aimed to evaluate the effects of milk kefir on parameters related to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in interleukin-10 knockout (IL-10-/-) mice. Sixteen C57BL/6J IL-10-/- male mice were divided into two experimental groups. The control group (n = 8) received 0.4 mL of whole milk (UHT) and the kefir group (n = 8) received 0.4 mL of a fermented beverage made from milk kefir grains (2.4 × 108 colony-forming units [CFU]), both administered via gavage for 4 weeks. Feces were collected and body weight was measured weekly. At the end of the study, the animals were anesthetized and euthanized, and the small intestine and cecum content were collected for analysis. Proximate composition of kefir and microbiological analysis were conducted. Histomorphometry measurements and quantification of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were conducted in small intestine. SFCAs were also evaluated in cecum content, and microbiota composition was evaluated in fecal samples. The kefir beverage improved histomorphometry characteristics of the small intestine, increased the number of goblet cells, reduced inflammatory infiltrates, increased Lactobacillus, and reduced Desulfovibrio, suggesting attenuation of the inflammatory process. Furthermore, the kefir beverage increased the concentration of butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid with anti-inflammatory properties, in the small intestine, which may also be associated with reduced inflammation in this group.",
    "The influence of rivers on seabird foraging ecology.. Morais JB, Chiaradia A, Reina RD (2026). Rivers act as vital arteries to the world's oceans, delivering fresh water and nutrients that sustain marine ecosystems. Globally, river flow increasingly is being altered by climate change and anthropogenic pressures; yet the significance of rivers to predatory marine species, such as seabirds, and the extent to which river-related changes affect their food webs, remains poorly understood. This review synthesises 51 studies specifically designed to examine river influences on seabird habitat selection, diet, health, and demographics, while highlighting methodological approaches and ecological patterns. Although river-related variables remain underutilised in seabird research, 88% (45/51) of studies that included them reported clear evidence of river effects for at least one type of seabird response, suggesting these ecological links are under-recognised rather than absent. When selected as the primary explanatory (most informative) variable in each study, plume-based metrics were conclusive in 95% (19/20) of cases, whereas river-specific metrics (namely number of rivers, river outflow and distance to river mouths) were conclusive in 84% (26/31) of cases, confirming that both metric types are highly reliable once aligned with the seabird response in question. River-influenced coastal waters consistently supported critical foraging hotspots across all seabird orders, whilst also exposing birds to potential pollutant burdens and altered prey dynamics. Seabird dietary data are a valuable indicator of prey variability associated with river outflows, with greater prey diversity recorded in estuarine habitats compared to marine ones. Rivers exhibited mixed effects under anthropogenic pressures but generally positive influences during climate disturbances, suggesting that seabirds may increasingly depend on riverine environments as buffers against changing marine conditions. We recommend expanding investigations into river impacts on seabird health in tropical systems, incorporating long-term hydrological influences, and prioritising the integration of river-specific and oceanographic data to predict seabird responses more effectively in a rapidly changing world.",
    "Zinc Iodide-Osmium Tetroxide (ZIO) Staining Reveals Differences in the Components of the Endomembrane System of Plant Secretory Cells.. Machado SR, Carvalho SF, Canaveze Y (2026). The Zinc Iodide-Osmium Tetroxide method (ZIO) is recognized for its effectiveness in impregnating the endomembrane system, particularly Golgi bodies. Nevertheless, its application in plant cell studies remains limited. This research focuses on Palicourea rigida Kunth, a Rubiaceae species known for its colleters producing a mixed secretion primarily composed of lipophilic substances. The aim of our study was to assess the effectiveness of the ZIO method in investigating ultrastructural variations of epithelial cells during the secretory phase. Samples were fixed for 12 h in a solution containing 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 mol/L phosphate buffer at pH 7.3. This was followed by a 22-h incubation at 4°C in a solution that included zinc (Zn), resublimed iodine (I), TRIS-aminomethane, and osmium tetroxide (OsO4). Subsequently, the samples underwent dehydration through a graded series of acetone and were embedded in Araldite resin. Ultrathin sections were contrasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and analyzed using a transmission electron microscope at 60 kV. While the epithelial cells exhibited morphological similarities, the ZIO method revealed diversity in their endomembrane systems. Some cells were rich in rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), while others were abundant in smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER), and some primarily contained Golgi bodies. These findings underscore the division of labor among neighboring secretory cells, which, despite their morphological similarities, show differences in their endomembrane systems during the same secretion stage. Therefore, the ZIO method emerges as a promising tool in plant secretion research, contributing to the understanding of the functional diversity of the endomembrane system in plant glands.",
    "Mobile consumers influence the shoreward edge of intertidal seagrass ecosystems.. Valdez SR, Smith CS, Brenner CL, Paxton AB, Silliman BR (2026). Habitat edges are often considered environmentally stressful areas, and as such, research has largely focused on the impacts of physical factors in shaping these edges. However, less is known about the relative importance of biotic disturbance agents and bottom-up drivers in shaping habitat edges. Here, we used intertidal seagrass beds as a model system to test how the independent and combined effects of stingrays-a disturbance-generating forager in seagrass beds-and nutrient addition affect the upper elevation edge of seagrasses. A two-season long manipulative experiment with stingray exclusion × nutrient addition revealed that shoreward seagrass edges experienced heightened loss in percent cover when exposed to stingrays (p = 0.037) but were not impacted by nutrient additions to marine sediments (p = 0.13). Additionally, transplant experiments designed to test whether stingrays could limit intertidal seagrass establishment in higher elevation found that transplanted seagrass had a higher chance of survival when stingrays were excluded (p < 0.01), suggesting that seagrass could live higher in the intertidal and that stingrays may limit shoreward expansion. Finally, a multi-site observational survey demonstrated that stingray pit abundance was a strong predictor of the distance between seagrass edge and shoreward habitats. Combined, these results challenge current understanding in plant ecology that seagrass edges are controlled mainly by physical factors and instead suggest that the structure of the seagrass shoreward edge is controlled by both physical and biotic drivers. Our results also indicate that the relative effects of consumer disturbance and physical factors in controlling edge limits are likely predicated on consumer density: in areas with higher densities of large consumers, biotic forcing is likely to be more important. Furthermore, these results could have implications for restoration in areas with high densities of disturbance-generating foragers and align with calls for greater inclusion of animal impacts into restoration schemes. Biotic drivers along environmentally stressful edges are likely not limited to seagrasses and the generality of biotic control of habitat edges deserves further exploration across diverse ecosystems.",
    "A Combination of Xanthohumol and Ursolic Acid in the Diet Leads to Synergistic Inhibition of Prostate Cancer Progression.. Clark R, Saha A, Lavender Hackman G, Friedman CA, Gorgoglione R, Tiziani S, DiGiovanni J (2026). Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common cancer and second leading cause of cancer death for American men. Chemoprevention by using phytochemicals offers a promising approach to improve outcomes due to their ability to act on cancer cell metabolism and growth while maintaining low toxicity profiles. The goal of this study was to assess the combination of xanthohumol (XAN) and ursolic acid (UA) given in the diet for synergistic efficacy against PCa progression and identify potential mechanisms of action. PCa cells were treated with the combination to evaluate cell survival and colony formation. Two mouse models of PCa were used to evaluate tolerability and efficacy of dietary administration of the combination and to further understand mechanism(s) of action. The combination of XAN + UA reduced PCa cell survival and colony formation. The combination given in the diet significantly and synergistically inhibited growth of HMVP2 PCa allograft tumors and also inhibited PCa progression in HiMyc mice. Mechanistically, inhibition of polyamine synthesis and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition contributed to the inhibition of HMVP2 allograft tumor growth, while the inhibition of PCa progression in HiMyc mice was associated with activation of the unfolded protein response pathway and apoptosis. Further studies in cultured PCa cells revealed additional effects of the combination on several oncogenic signaling pathways (e.g, phospho-STAT3) and cell cycle regulatory proteins (e.g, cyclin D1, phospho-Rb).",
    "Use of Ultraviolet C-Radiation Therapy in Trauma and Orthopaedics: A Current State of Evidence.. Giannoudis VP, King SW, Matthews H, Rodham PL, Vickers O, Pandit H, Van Duren B (2026). Ultraviolet-C (UV-C) radiation exhibits potent germicidal capabilities through DNA and RNA damage in microorganisms. Its utilisation in orthopaedics began primarily for theatre sterilisation. Current applications focus extensively on surface, air, and equipment sterilisation within orthopaedic theatres. The aim of this scoping review was to establish the current uses and practices of UV-C in orthopaedic surgery. A comprehensive literature review was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines, sourcing articles from PubMed/MEDLINE and Google Scholar from inception till January 2025. Studies included addressed UV-C applications in orthopaedic sterilisation and disinfection, financial analyses, and clinical infection outcomes. Data extracted included study parameters, methods, UV-C exposure specifics, microbial colony counts, and outcomes. Out of 2574 articles identified initially, 23 studies met the inclusion criteria. Fifteen articles addressed UV-C sterilisation, highlighting substantial microbial reductions on theatre surfaces and equipment, although effectiveness varied by organism and exposure duration. Eight studies investigated UV-C's impact on infection rates and skin health, showing significant infection reduction in arthroplasty cases without major adverse dermatological effects. Financial analysis was available from only one study, which indicated significant cost savings compared to traditional methods. UV-C radiation appears effective in reducing microbial contamination in orthopaedic theatres, complementing traditional cleaning practices. It offers promising infection reduction in arthroplasty with manageable safety concerns. Indeed, use of UV-C may be an efficient way of reducing infection risk without the need for antibiotic use, and this can contribute to reduction in the risk of antimicrobial resistance. Future research should focus on refining protocols and exploring broader clinical and economic impacts.",
    "Novel mechanism of tumor metastasis: DDX11-ATAD5 interaction mediates epithelial-mesenchymal transition to promote gallbladder cancer progression.. Kong L, Li W, Kong W, Yang H (2025). OBJECTIVE: Molecular mechanisms underlying gallbladder cancer (GBC) progression remain incompletely understood. This study aims to investigate the role and molecular mechanism of DEAD/H-box helicase 11 (DDX11)-ATPase family AAA domain containing 5 (ATAD5) protein interaction in GBC pathogenesis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cell proliferation, colony formation, and Transwell assays were performed to evaluate the effects of DDX11-ATAD5 interaction in GBC cells. Sequencing data were analyzed to assess DDX11 and ATAD5 expression in GBC tissues, and immunofluorescence co-localization and co-immunoprecipitation assays were conducted to verify the interaction between DDX11 and ATAD5. Subcutaneous xenograft and metastasis models were established to validate their functions in vivo, and E-cadherin and vimentin were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Both DDX11 and ATAD5 were upregulated in GBC tissues and exhibited direct protein-protein interaction (P < 0.05). Functional studies revealed that DDX11 promoted GBC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion while inhibiting apoptosis (P < 0.01). ATAD5 silencing markedly attenuated the oncogenic effects mediated by DDX11. In vivo experiments further confirmed that DDX11 overexpression enhanced subcutaneous tumor growth and metastasis in nude mice (P < 0.001). Mechanistically, the DDX11-ATAD5 complex promoted GBC cell invasion and metastasis by facilitating the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT; P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: This study reveals a novel molecular mechanism whereby DDX11-ATAD5 interaction promotes GBC progression through EMT activation, providing potential therapeutic targets for GBC diagnosis and treatment.",
    "The mechanism of prostaglandin E2 upregulation of programmed death ligand 1 expression promoting immune escape in non-small cell lung cancer.. Wang T, Liu L, Liu S (2025). OBJECTIVE: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents a major contributor to cancer-related mortality. This study aims to investigate the prostaglandin E synthase (PTGES) role in NSCLC, especially how prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which is synthesized by PTGES prompts programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, resulting in immune escape. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The PTGES and PGE2 expression levels were tested in normal and NSCLC samples, respectively. An A549 cell line that overexpressed and knocked down PTGES was established, and cell multiplication, colony formation, and aggression were evaluated. The PD-L1 levels and cytotoxicity effect of CD8+ T cells were analyzed by co-culture with A549 cells. The expression levels of proteins involved in phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and the effect of activation and inhibition on PD-L1 expression were investigated. The effect of PGE2 was further verified by establishing an in vivo xenograft mouse model. RESULTS: The expression of PTGES in NSCLC cells notably increased compared with that in control cells (P < 0.001). Correspondingly, a significant upregulation of PGE2 levels was observed (P < 0.001). Overexpression of PTGES enhanced cell proliferation and aggression ability (P < 0.001), whereas knockdown of PTGES weakened these capabilities (P < 0.01). In the experiment of co-culture with CD8+ T cells, PD-L1 was upregulated (P < 0.01) and cytotoxicity was considerably reduced (P < 0.01) in the PTGES overexpression group. Meanwhile, PD-L1 was downregulated (P < 0.01) and cytotoxicity was enhanced (P < 0.01) in the PTGES knockdown group. Overexpression of PTGES was able to activate the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway (P < 0.01). Activation and inhibition of this pathway showed that PGE2 upregulated PD-L1 expression through this signaling pathway (P < 0.01). The mouse transplanted tumor model further verified the effect of PTGES expression on tumor growth and immune escape. CONCLUSION: This study confirmed that PGE2 promotes immune evasion of NSCLC by upregulating PD-L1, and the mechanism involves the activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. This research provides a novel theoretical basis for immunotherapy of NSCLC and emphasizes the clinical value of PTGES/PGE2 as a potential target.",
    "Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L5 promotes the development of renal cell carcinoma through the glycolysis mediated by the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway.. Ruan L, Li S, Xu L (2025). OBJECTIVE: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a prevalent malignant tumor of the kidney that has considerable heterogeneity and intricate molecular pathways. Incidence and death rates associated with kidney cancer have been increasing steadily. Consequently, investigating its molecular basis and identifying new biomarkers for targeted therapies have become important. Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L5 (UCHL5) has an effect on tumor initiation and progression. This study aims to explore the role of UCHL5 in promoting RCC development and identify related molecular mechanisms. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot (WB) analyses were employed to measure UCHL5 expression. Stable UCHL5 overexpression and knockdown cell lines were generated using lentiviral transfection in 786-O cells. Colony formation and 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine assays were used to assess cell proliferation. Cell migration was evaluated using scratch assays, while invasion capacity was determined by Transwell assays. Commercial kits were utilized to quantify glucose consumption and lactate production. WB was applied to detect proteins related to glycolysis and components of the Phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. The function of UCHL5 in RCC cells was validated in vivo through an animal tumor model. RESULTS: The expression of UCHL5 increased in RCC cell lines (P < 0.01). Silencing UCHL5 significantly impaired the malignant behavior of RCC cells (P < 0.01), whereas its overexpression promoted this cellular behavior (P < 0.05). Reducing UCHL5 levels decreased glucose uptake, lactate secretion, and protein expression involved in glycolysis, while overexpression enhanced glycolytic activity in RCC cells (P < 0.01). Knockdown of UCHL5 diminished the phosphorylation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway proteins (P < 0.05), whereas the opposite effect was observed upon overexpression (P < 0.01). Treatment with 740Y-P effectively reversed the suppression of glycolysis, proliferation, and metastasis caused by UCHL5 knockdown (P < 0.01). Conversely, LY294002 inhibited the glycolytic enhancement and aggressive phenotypes induced by UCHL5 overexpression (P < 0.01). Animal experiments further confirmed that UCHL5 downregulation suppressed RCC growth through the PI3K/AKT/ mTOR pathway (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: UCHL5 activates the PI3K/AKT/mTOR cascade, which enhances the glycolysis of RCC cells and promotes the development of renal cancer. This study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the oncogenic role of UCHL5 in RCC.",
    "Evaluating a Flexible Workflow for Candida auris Surveillance on the AltoStar Automation System AM16 with Commercial and In-House Real-Time PCR Assays.. Lee CK, Cheng JWS, Liyana NA, Lau DSN, Lin KK, Chan THM, Chew KL, Teo JWP (2026). BACKGROUND: Multidrug-resistant yeast Candida (Candidozyma) auris, responsible for healthcare-associated outbreaks and high mortality, is a major global health threat. Rapid and scalable molecular diagnostics is essential; however, few automated platforms can accommodate both commercial assays and laboratory-developed tests (LDTs). We evaluated the analytical and clinical performance of two real-time PCR assays for C. auris detection using the AltoStar Automation System AM16. METHODS: One assay was an in-house LDT (targeting the internal transcribed spacer region), while the other was AltoStar C. auris PCR Kit 1.5 (Altona Diagnostics) assay. An integrated workflow, which included automated nucleic acid extraction and PCR setup, was employed. Analytical performance was evaluated in terms of precision, specificity, and limit of detection (LoD) using C. auris Clades I, II, and VI. Clinical accuracy was assessed using a 36-sample panel (surveillance swabs and contrived positives) tested in parallel with the DiaSorin Simplexa C. auris Direct assay (DiaSorin Molecular LLC), with culture as the reference standard. RESULTS: Both assays demonstrated excellent reproducibility, with CVs below 5%, and 100% analytical specificity. The in-house LDT showed greater sensitivity, with LoDs of 25-191 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL (1.56-12 CFU/reaction) versus 52-235 CFU/mL (3.25-15 CFU/reaction) for the Altona assay. Regarding clinical accuracy, the LDT, Altona assay, and DiaSorin assay showed 100% positive and negative agreement with the culture results (Cohen's kappa=1.00). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first documented comparison of a commercial assay and an LDT on the AltoStar AM16, demonstrating the platform's flexibility, which can enhance laboratory adaptability and capacity to combat the spread of C. auris, a critical fungal pathogen.",
    "HnRPD/AUF1 facilitates human ovarian cancer progression through activating FLI1 and maintaining cisplatin resistance.. Tang C, Zhu C, An Z, Cao B, Xu Q, Li L, Bao Y, Li J (2026). Ovarian cancer (OC) is the predominant gynecological cancer and is associated with severe morbidity and high mortality worldwide. Therefore, clarifying the molecular mechanisms underlying OC progression and exploring novel therapeutic targets are important. Here, using human OC samples, different OC cell lines, and xenograft nude mouse models in combination with multiple sequencings, we report that hnRPD, an RNA binding protein that modulates RNA stability, is highly expressed in OC tissues, and contributes to OC cell malignancy in human OC cells cultured in vitro and in OC cell-derived xenograft nude mouse models in vivo. Mechanistically, ectopically expressed GPR137 binds to hnRPD and enhances hnRPD protein stability, which reciprocally transactivates GPR137 through the transcription factor FLI1. On the other hand, elevated hnRPD upregulates RAB8A expression by interacting with RAB8A mRNA and promoting its stability, leading to activation of downstream cell signaling and thereby enhanced OC cell malignant behaviors including cell proliferation, cell invasion, cell migration, and colony formation ability as well as OC xenograft growth in nude mice. Moreover, cisplatin in combination with silencing of hnRPD expression, significantly induces apoptosis in cisplatin-resistant OC cells through regulation of OC cell metabolism. Therefore, our data provide evidence that hnRPD could represent an innovative prognostic indicator for OC and may be an attractive therapeutic target for improving clinical outcomes in OC treatment.",
    "ECRG4 suppressed the progression of breast cancer via modulating NFIC/PTEN and SHP2/PI3K/SP1 signaling.. Song D, Wei Y, Zhao X, Ning D (2026). OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which ECRG4 regulates breast cancer progression, with a focus on its tumor-suppressive effects mediated through the NFIC/PTEN and SHP2/PI3K/SP1 signaling pathways. METHODS: Bioinformatics analysis was used to identify genes associated with ECRG4. Subcutaneous tumor transplantation experiments in nude mice were conducted to assess breast cancer progression; immunohistochemical staining was used to detect the expression of p-SHP2, ECRG4, and NFIC in tumor tissues; Western blot analysis was employed to assess the expression levels of relevant proteins. Scratch assays, Transwell assays, and plate colony formation assays were conducted to evaluate the migration and invasion capabilities of human breast cancer cell line MCF-7, while flow cytometry was used to analyze the cell cycle and apoptosis status of MCF-7 cells. RESULTS: Bioinformatics analysis revealed significant associations between ECRG4 and the NFIC/PTEN and SHP2/PI3K/SP1 pathways. Under hypoxic and low-serum conditions, p-SHP2 activates the PI3K/AKT pathway and induces SP1 expression, thereby upregulating the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 and suppressing the expression of the tumor suppressor gene ECRG4. ECRG4 positively regulates the transcription factor NFIC, leading to increased expression of its downstream target gene PTEN. PTEN negatively feeds back to inhibit the activity of the PI3K/AKT pathway. The activated PI3K/AKT pathway phosphorylates the transcription factor CREB, driving the expression of the E3 ubiquitin ligase SKP2, thereby promoting cell survival. Meanwhile, the pro-apoptotic factors FOXO1/FOXO3a and SKP2 form a bidirectional antagonistic interaction: SKP2 mediates the ubiquitination and degradation of FOXO1/FOXO3a, while FOXO1/FOXO3a can transcriptionally inhibit SKP2 expression, jointly regulating the dynamic balance between apoptosis and survival. CONCLUSION: ECRG4 inhibits breast cancer progression by positively regulating NFIC/PTEN to suppress the SHP2/PI3K/SP1 signaling pathway. Targeting this signaling axis may provide a new strategy for breast cancer treatment.",
    "Morusinol exerts anti-glioma activity by targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.. Jin Z, Xiao C, Ma S, Li G, Zhu M, Zhang F, Zhang H, Yu R (2026). Glioma is a highly aggressive brain tumor with limited treatment options. Natural compounds offer promising therapeutic alternatives due to their safety and low toxicity. Morusinol, a flavonoid from Morus alba, exhibits anti-tumor effects in various cancers, but its role in glioma remains unknown. This study demonstrates that Morusinol significantly inhibits proliferation, migration, invasion, and colony formation of LN229 and U251 glioma cells, with IC50 values around 20 μM. It induces apoptosis by increasing ROS levels and modulating Bcl-2 family proteins and caspase-3 activation. Network pharmacology and molecular docking predict strong binding of Morusinol to key PI3K/AKT pathway components, including p110α, p85α, PDK1, and PTEN. Western blotting confirms that Morusinol suppresses AKT and mTOR phosphorylation, indicating pathway inhibition. Importantly, co-treatment with UCL-TRO-1938, a p110α activator, partially reverses Morusinol-induced suppression of AKT phosphorylation and cell proliferation, supporting target specificity. These results indicate that Morusinol exerts potent anti-glioma effects primarily through inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Our findings highlight Morusinol as a promising natural agent for glioma therapy.",
    "Humans are more prosocial in poor foraging environments.. Vogel TA, Priestley L, Cutler J, Hogg T, Khalighinejad N, Garrett N, Apps MAJ, Rushworth MFS, Lockwood PL (2026). Prosocial behaviours are essential for solving global challenges. Often, these behaviours have been measured using economic games or tasks where people decide between helping or not. However, in everyday life current behaviours are interrupted with alternative opportunities. Across three independent samples (two preregistered, total n = 510), people watched a movie whilst encountering opportunities that benefitted another person or themselves. Crucially, participants decided in different poor and rich foraging environments where the average reward values of opportunities changed. We demonstrate a stronger environmental influence on decisions that benefit others: people were more willing to interrupt their behaviour to help others in poor environments, where the average reward value was lower, compared to richer environments where average reward value was higher. Computational modelling revealed that the opportunity costs of the different foraging environments were valued distinctly for others. Factors of utilitarianism, and empathy/emotional motivation, captured variability in opportunity costs for others. We show that when humans decide to engage in prosocial behaviours depends on the quality of opportunities in one's environment, which is critical as environments change.",
    "Shorter, faster, but still accurate: using ant colony optimisation to develop and validate the Athlete Mental Health Screener-18 (AMHS-18) as a brief alternative to Sport Mental Health Assessment Tool 1 (SMHAT-1).. Waleriańczyk W, Wójcik K, Konopka K, Lisek G, Iwaszkiewicz E, Krysztofiak H, Krzywański J, Zawadzki B (2026). OBJECTIVE: Sport Mental Health Assessment Tool 1 (SMHAT-1) ensures comprehensive and reliable mental health screening in athletes. However, its triage's predictive validity varies depending on the mental health domain (5%-60% false negative rates), while the full algorithm imposes a substantial time burden for routine screening. This study aimed to develop and validate a brief, clinically accurate alternative using the pool of items included in SMHAT-1. METHODS: SMHAT-1 and subsequent brief clinical interviews were administered in Polish Olympic athletes over three waves of routine medical check-ups. An ant colony optimisation algorithm that evaluates item combinations holistically rather than sequentially was trained on two datasets (N1=1121, N2=803) to identify the optimal item subset predicting post-interview mental health recommendations. The solution underwent independent validation in the third dataset (N3=1134). RESULTS: The best solution comprised 18 items, achieved 81% accuracy in predicting the post-clinical interview mental health evaluation in the training datasets and 80% in an independent dataset, overperforming the SMHAT-1 triage on all performance indicators. The Athlete Mental Health Screen-18 (AMHS-18) demonstrated superior sensitivity (94%) and specificity (72%) at the optimal cut-off (≥19), with strong internal consistency (ω=0.82). CONCLUSION: The AMHS-18 is a time-efficient, valid and reliable tool for accurate mental health screening in athletes. It offers a practical alternative to the full SMHAT-1, particularly in settings where time and resources are limited or when athletes are screened regularly. We recommend using AMHS-18 instead of SMHAT-1's triage and alternating SMHAT-1 with AMHS-18 as a starting point for routine brief clinical intake interviews.",
    "The proliferative Scissor(+) gene signature model uncovers the ISG15-KPNA2 axis as a critical driver of malignancy in ccRCC.. Pu S, Qian S, Ding Y, Yu F, Li B, Li Q, Xing J, Wang Z, Xu A (2026). BACKGROUND: Clear cell renal cell carcinoma remains a therapeutic challenge due to tumor heterogeneity and limited biomarkers. Proliferating cell subpopulations in the tumor microenvironment contribute to cancer progression, yet their transcriptional features and clinical relevance in ccRCC are not fully characterized. METHODS: We integrated single-cell RNA-seq (GSE156632) and bulk transcriptomic data (TCGA-KIRC, EMTAB1980, CPTAC). Proliferating (G2/M-S phase) cells were identified through cell cycle analysis, and the Scissor algorithm was applied to select phenotype-associated malignant subpopulations. A prognostic model was constructed using 117 machine-learning algorithms and validated through multi-omics analysis. Functional assays including CCK-8, colony formation, wound healing, Transwell, and in vivo xenograft models were performed to validate key targets. The interaction between ISG15 and KPNA2 was investigated using co-immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, and ubiquitination assays. The role of ISG15 in regulating KPNA2 stability via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway was examined using cycloheximide chase experiments and proteasome inhibition. RESULTS: We identified proliferative Scissor+ cells in ccRCC scRNA-seq data and derived 108 proliferative-associated genes. A prognostic model comprising 11 genes was constructed via Lasso+plsRcox, demonstrating robust predictive performance across multiple cohorts. High-risk patients exhibited enriched HIF-1/VEGF signaling, elevated TMB, immunosuppressive microenvironments, and increased TIDE scores. ISG15 knockdown suppressed proliferation, migration, and invasion in ccRCC cells by promoting KPNA2 ubiquitination and degradation, which was rescued by KPNA2 overexpression.",
    "MicroRNA-488-3p-loaded engineered exosomes inhibit proliferation, migration and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma by targeting SEC61G.. Gao H, He Z, Yang S, Wang X, Yan Q, Gao C, Liu N, Zhang Z, Niu W, Niu J, Peng C (2026). SEC61G is an oncogene in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a common malignant tumor worldwide. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulation of oncogenes are available therapeutic strategies being investigated in HCC, but the effective miRNA delivery remains a challenge. Here, we investigated the potential therapeutic effects of miRNA-loaded engineered exosomes in patients with HCC. MiRNAs that could bind to SEC61G were screened using Targetscan, and were verified using HepG2 cells viability after transfecting miRNAs mimic. Five miRNAs binding to SEC61G,among which, miR-651-3p and miR-488-3p mimic significantly inhibited HepG2 cells viability (p < 0.05) and decreased SEC61G protein expression. Then, dual-luciferase reporter assay also confirmed SEC61G as a target of miR-488-3p in HCC. After that, miR-488-3p-loaded engineered exosomes (Exo-miR-488-3p) were isolated from the supernatant of 488-3p-overexpressed cells and identified via nanoparticle tracking analysis, transmission electron microscopy and western blot. In vitro experiments showed that exo-miR-488-3p significantly inhibited proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion of HepG2 cells than corresponding negative control. In addition, Exo-miR-488-3p tended to induce HepG2 cells apoptosis, though this relationship was not statistically significant. In conclusion, exo-miR-488-3p inhibits the malignant cytological activities in HCC, a possible strategy in the treatment of HCC.",
    "Regional variations in the diet of the South Polar Skua (Stercorarius maccormicki) in the Ross Sea region, Antarctica.. Kim J, Kim Y, Kim JU, Oh Y, Kim JH (2026). The South Polar Skua (Stercorarius maccormicki) is an opportunistic feeder, predator, and scavenger widely distributed in the coastal ecosystems of Antarctica. However, although some studies have explored its foraging behavior, many aspects, including regional variations, remain insufficiently understood. Thus, this study aimed to characterize regional variations in the dietary composition of South Polar Skuas breeding at sites along the Northern Victoria Land coast in the Ross Sea, where environmental conditions vary markedly among colonies. The dietary composition and foraging characteristics of the South Polar Skua populations in the Ross Sea region were investigated by analyzing stable carbon (δ¹³C) and nitrogen (δ¹⁵N) isotopes in blood samples. The values were then used to quantify isotopic niches and estimate dietary contributions. Results revealed significant regional variations in the dietary composition of skuas. Compared with skuas at other sites, skuas at Cape Möbius showed higher δ¹³C values, suggesting a greater reliance on fish and the placenta or carcasses of Weddell seals for food. While δ¹⁵N values did not significantly differ among skuas at various sites, skuas at Cape Möbius and Cape Washington had higher values than those at other sites, suggesting access to higher trophic-level prey. Site-specific dietary contributions were revealed, with Adélie Penguin eggs and fish dominating the diet at Cape Hallett and Inexpressible Island, whereas Emperor Penguin eggs and fish were more prominent at Cape Washington. Our findings demonstrate that the species exhibits site-specific foraging patterns shaped by local prey availability. These results provide novel insights into the trophic ecology of this top predator and contribute to a broader understanding of the spatial dietary variation in Antarctic seabirds.",
    "A MERTK-Targeting Antibody-Drug Conjugate Selectively Depletes M2 Tumor-Associated Macrophages and MERTK-Expressing Cancer Cells.. Takeda S, Sridhar S, Schefer D, Andreu-Agullo C, Lo PC, Lee M, Busby R, Darst DM, Assmus A, Anaganti S, Halberg N, Ostendorf BN, Lorenz IC, Tavazoie SF, Tavazoie MF, Kurth I (2026). MERTK is a receptor tyrosine kinase predominantly expressed on M2 macrophages that plays a critical role in the clearance of apoptotic cells and maintenance of an immune-suppressive phenotype. M2 macrophages are highly abundant in the tumor microenvironment where they facilitate tumor progression and resistance to immunotherapy. MERTK is also overexpressed in cancer cells, where it can drive cancer survival and metastasis through induction of proliferation and anti-apoptotic signaling programs. Here we developed an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that simultaneously targets MERTK-expressing M2 tumor associated macrophages and cancer cells. The ADC comprised the monoclonal antibody RGX-019 that binds human MERTK, combined with a monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) toxic payload. The unconjugated antibody had intrinsic activity to suppress M2 cytokine expression by macrophages, block in vitro colony formation of cancer cells, and inhibit in vivo tumor growth and metastasis. When MMAE was conjugated to the antibody, the ADC exhibited superior in vitro cytotoxicity and in vivo anti-tumor efficacy in MERTK-expressing tumors. Tumor growth inhibition in humanized mice was associated with depletion of tumor-associated M2 macrophages. Furthermore, unlike other MERTK-targeting small molecules or antibodies, no retinal toxicity of RGX-019-MMAE was observed in vivo. These findings reveal that combined therapeutic targeting of MERTK in cancer cells and M2 macrophages offers enhanced opportunities for anti-tumor efficacy in a wide range of MERTK-expressing tumors.",
    "A primer on equivalence (negligible effect) testing.. Beribisky N, Cribbie RA (2026). Equivalence testing, also called negligible effect significance testing (NEST), is appropriate when a researcher would like to find evidence of a negligible association. However, since equivalence testing/NEST procedures are newer and considerably less popular than traditional difference-based null hypothesis significance testing, it is useful to give a gentle introduction to these methods. Accordingly, this tutorial article aims to provide an overview of NEST/equivalence testing procedures by describing the nature of the procedures, explaining when they should be used, defining what considerations should go into their application (including selecting a minimally meaningful effect size), and outlining how they may be conducted and interpreted. The tutorial article also includes examples and code in open-source software to illustrate how these procedures may be applied to real data.

    "Mechanism of FOXP2 in the Hepatocellular Carcinoma Progression via Ferroptosis Through RBM15B-Mediated m6A Modification.. Liu W, He J, Zheng J, Tang Q (2026). HCC predominantly develops in individuals with chronic hepatic conditions and liver cirrhosis, which is marked by high mortality. This study investigates the functional roles and molecular mechanisms by which FOXP2 modulates HCC progression through ferroptosis. After HCC and normal cells were cultured, the expression of FOXP2, RBM15B, and KDM4C was analyzed using western blot or RT-qPCR. After FOXP2 intervention, cellular metabolic activity was assessed via CCK-8 assay, while replicative capacity was quantified through EdU staining and colony formation assays; key regulators of ferroptosis were analyzed by western blot; iron content and oxidative stress levels were measured. The binding between FOXP2 and RBM15B was investigated through ChIP and dual-luciferase assays. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to verify the regulation of RBM15B on KDM4C via m6A modification. MeRIP was utilized to examine m6A enrichment on KDM4C mRNA. ChIP was employed to examine the enrichment of KDM4C and H3K9me3 on SLC7A11 promoters. Combined experiments investigated the role of the RBM15B/KDM4C axis in FOXP2-mediated ferroptosis and HCC cell proliferation. Xenograft models were developed in nude mice to validate the mechanism. FOXP2 expression was downregulated in HCC. FOXP2 overexpression significantly inhibited HCC cell proliferation and promoted ferroptosis. FOXP2 repressed RBM15B expression, suppressed the RBM15B-mediated m6A modification, inhibited KDM4C expression, upregulated H3K9me3 levels, and suppressed SLC7A11 expression, ultimately enhancing ferroptosis. Overexpression of RBM15B or KDM4C attenuated ferroptosis and reversed the suppression of HCC cell growth induced by FOXP2 overexpression. In conclusion, FOXP2 may promote ferroptosis and inhibit cell proliferation in HCC by decreasing SLC7A11 expression via the RBM15B/KDM4C axis in an m6A-dependent manner.",
    "Study of oral microbiome by next generation sequencing in T1DM adolescents with periodontal disease.. Chakraborty P, Basu M, Mukhopadhyay P, Chowdhury R, Ghosh S (2026). BACKGROUND: Periodontal disease (PD) is common in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM); however, studies related to oral microbiome in PD in type 1 diabetes is limited. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study,60 participants were enrolled in three groups. T1DM with PD (DMPD, n = 20), T1DM without periodontal disease (DM, n = 20)), and siblings without diabetes but with PD (PD, n = 20)). All the participants underwent comprehensive periodontal examination. Gingival plaque samples were collected for DNA isolation and next-generation sequencing to quantify microbiological abundance. RESULTS: In total, 3294 operational taxonomic units were identified and analysed. Significant difference was observed across the groups, notably Prevotella, Megasphaera, Dialister, and Camphylobacter, Aggregatibacter, and Corynebacterium showed difference in abundance. Prevotella was found to have a very high and statistically significant abundance in DMPD. Prevotella, Veillonella, and Selenomonas were significantly higher in the poorly controlled glycemic group. Subjects with severe Gingival Index (GI) exhibit higher abundance of Capnocytophaga, Neisseria and Rothia compared to those with non-severe GI. CONCLUSION: The Oral microbiome composition of individuals with T1DM varied significantly in the presence of periodontal disease. The oral microbiome also varies according to glycemic status of T1DM and severity of PD. The markedly increased abundance of certain phyla and genera in subjects with PD and diabetes suggests a role for the relevant microbiota in the development of periodontal infection in T1DM subjects.",
    "Investigation of the Anticancer Effects and Senescence Induction of Hesperetin Combined with Cisplatin in Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Embryonic Fibroblast Cell Lines.. Artanti AN, Jenie RI, Rumiyati R, Hermawan A, Jun-Ya K, Hanifa M (2026). OBJECTIVE: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common form of liver cancer, often develops in individuals with chronic liver diseases, especially cirrhosis. Cisplatin (Cisp), a chemotherapy agent commonly used in HCC treatment, is effective but is known to damage normal cells, including fibroblasts. Hesperetin (HST), a citrus flavanone found abundantly in citrus fruits, has demonstrated antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties. This study aimed to investigate the synergistic cytotoxic effects and selective induction of senescence by HST in combination with Cisp in HepG2 cancer cells and NIH-3T3 fibroblast cells. METHODS: The cytotoxic effects of HST were assessed using the MTT assay to determine cell viability. The antiproliferative properties were evaluated using colony formation assays. Senescence was assessed using SA-β-gal staining, while flow cytometry was used to analyze cell cycle distribution and apoptosis. Protein expression related to proliferation and apoptosis was determined via Western blot analysis. RESULTS: MTT assay results indicated that both HST and Cisp reduced HepG2 cell viability in a dose-dependent manner, with IC50 values of 258 ± 2.47 µM and 5 ± 1.83 µM, respectively. Their combination (HST: 33-130 µM; Cisp: 0.6-2.5 µM) showed synergistic effects (combination index, CI < 1) co-treatment with HST (65 and 130 µM) significantly enhanced senescence in HepG2 cells. Clonogenic assays showed inhibition of colony formation, supported by reduced expression of p-ERK1/2 and Cyclin D1. Flow cytometry revealed increased apoptosis and G2/M phase arrest, with upregulation of Bax and caspase-3, and downregulation of Bcl-xL. In NIH-3T3 cells, HST showed minimal cytotoxicity (IC50 > 500 µM), and co-treatment with Cisp reduced senescence markers. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that HST and Cisp co-treatment synergistically reduces cancer cell viability while protecting normal fibroblasts from senescence, supporting its potential as a co-chemotherapeutic agent in HCC treatment, while also serving as a protective agent against senescence in healthy tissues.",
    "Long non-coding RNA LINC00092 inhibits esophageal squamous cell carcinoma progression by promoting ferroptosis through the MAZ/NFE2L2 axis.. Dong K, Tian Z, Zhang Y, Su P, Huang C, Wen S (2026). BACKGROUND: Esophageal cancer (EC) is the eighth most prevalent malignancy worldwide and exhibits the sixth poorest prognosis. Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is the predominant pathological subtype. Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of cell death, plays a critical role in cancer progression. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as key regulators in the initiation and progression of EC. However, the role of lncRNAs in modulating ferroptosis within EC remains poorly understood. Therefore, this study aimed to identify key ferroptosis-related lncRNAs in ESCC and to investigate the role and mechanism of a specific lncRNA, long intergenic non-protein-coding RNA 92 (LINC00092). METHODS: Bioinformatics analysis was conducted to identify ferroptosis-related lncRNAs, transcription factors (TFs), and genes associated with ESCC. The expression, function, tumor microenvironment, immunotherapy, and downstream molecular pathways were also determined. The expression levels of LINC00092, MYC-associated zinc finger protein (MAZ), and NFE2 like bZIP transcription factor 2 (NFE2L2) were detected using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), immunohistochemical analysis, and western blotting. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed to determine the subcellular localization of LINC00092. 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), colony formation, wound healing, Transwell, and flow cytometry apoptosis assays were performed to determine the phenotypes and functions of loss- and gain-of LINC00092. RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and luciferase reporter assays were used to evaluate interactions involving LINC00092. The expression of ferroptosis-related proteins was verified by western blotting. RESULTS: LINC00092 was found to be downregulated in ESCC datasets, cell lines, and tissue samples. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that LINC00092 was associated with ferroptosis and negatively correlated with NFE2L2 expression. Further investigations demonstrated that LINC00092 acted as a binder to the TF MAZ, modulating the expression of the ferroptosis-related gene NFE2L2. Overexpression of LINC00092 inhibited ESCC cell progression, whereas its downregulation promoted tumor progression. RIP and luciferase reporter assays confirmed that MAZ was a target of LINC00092, and NFE2L2 was a downstream target of MAZ. Western blot analysis showed that LINC00092 enhanced ferroptosis in ESCC cells. The LINC00092/MAZ/NFE2L2 axis appeared to inhibit cancer progression by promoting ferroptosis through the regulation of NFE2L2 and sequestration of the TF MAZ. CONCLUSIONS: LINC00092 exerts tumor-suppressive effects in ESCC cells by inhibiting cancer progression through the LINC00092/MAZ/NFE2L2 axis and promoting ferroptosis. Therefore, LINC00092 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for ESCC.",
    "Promotion of lung cancer growth via glutamate ionotropic receptor N-methyl-D-aspartate-type subunit 2D (GRIN2D).. Lv Y, Bu X, Du Z, Zhang Y, Si Y, Shi H, Han L, Bao H (2026). BACKGROUND: N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are known to contribute to neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. Meanwhile, glutamate ionotropic receptor N-methyl-D-aspartate-type subunit 2D (GRIN2D), which encodes NMDAR subunit 2D, may play a role in colorectal cancer. The study examined whether GRIN2D is involved in lung cancer. METHODS: Through the use of quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), GRIN2D expression was detected in tissue samples and cell lines. EdU staining assay was used to determine the cell proliferation ability, while TUNEL staining assay was used to evaluate apoptosis. The phosphorylation levels of PI3K, AKT, and mTOR were measured via Western blotting; cell viability was evaluated via Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay; and colony formation ability was examined via colony formation assay. RESULTS: In this study, we demonstrated that lung adenocarcinoma and related cancer cell lines had significantly high levels of GRIN2D expression. GRIN2D promoted cancer cell proliferation while inhibiting apoptosis via the PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway. Esketamine, a GRIN2D inhibitor, and LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, either alone or in combination, could suppress the tumor growth induced by high GRIN2D levels both in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to identify the involvement of GRIN2D in lung cancer and to clarify the underlying mechanism of its effect; the findings further suggest that ketamine in cancer treatment may extend beyond relieving pain and depression.",
    "Effects of sampling methods on bee pollinators observed in Cucurbita pepo.. Walls C, Kuhar T, Roulston T, Wilson J (2026). This study was performed to compare catch abundance of three commonly used bee sampling methods within pumpkin and squash (Cucurbita pepo) fields. The three methods of sampling included visual sampling, vacuum sampling, and bowl trapping. Cucurbita pepo require bee pollinators to move pollen from male flower to female flower for fruit to set. In Cucurbita pepo the three major expected bee types that should be observed are squash bees Xenoglossa pruinosa Say (formerly Eucera (Peponapis) pruinosa) [Hymenoptera: Apidae], bumble bees (Bombus spp.) [Hymenoptera: Apidae], and honey bees (Apis mellifera L. [Hymenoptera: Apidae]). Knowing what bees are present in a grower's field could help them to make field management decisions and potentially reduce input costs, thus we chose methods where collected specimens could be submitted to experts for identification. We used visual observations as our control as we could confirm these bees were contacting flower reproductive segments, and this method is widely adopted in literature. Through this study, a total of 2,502 bees were observed, of which 82% were squash bees, 3.4% were honey bees and 2.4% were bumble bees. Bowl sampling differed significantly from visual observations for all three major bee types, having significantly fewer catches. Vacuum sampling recovered no bumble bees. Vacuum sampling was not significantly different from visual observation for honey bees but caught fewer squash bees relative to visual sampling. This study also looked at other collected morphotaxa of bees, particularly in bowl trapping, however bees beyond the three taxa presented above had limited presence in visual observations, and as such were not considered to play a major role in the pollination of these plants. This study indicates that visual observation of flowers provides a more reliable estimate of active pollinators in C. pepo fields than the two other bee sampling methods, vacuum sampling and bowl trapping, and they should likely not be deployed by growers to gain a representative sample of active pollinators in the field.",
    "Antibacterial efficacy of different irrigants and activation techniques in primary endodontic infections: A randomized controlled trial.. Dua T, Garg A, Kumar H, Bhasin P, Tandan M, Singla MG (2026). AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the antibacterial efficacy of two root canal irrigants - 2.5% sodium hypochlorite and 2% Chlorhexidine with and without activation for the treatment of primary endodontic infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study involved 90 patients with single-rooted, nonvital teeth with normal periapical appearance. Pretreatment samples (S1) were taken following access opening and determination of working length. One of six experimental groups - each representing a distinct irrigant activation technique - was randomly assigned to the participants: Group I received 2.5% NaOCl with conventional syringe and needle; Group II received 2.5% NaOCl with sonic activation; and Group III was treated with 2.5% NaOCl using ultrasonic activation (UA), Group IV used 2% CHX with conventional syringe and needle; Group V involved 2% CHX with sonic activation; and Group VI utilized 2% CHX with UA. Following chemomechanical preparation, posttreatment samples (S2) were obtained. Bacterial colonies were then quantified after 24 h using conventional colony-counting methods. RESULTS: In the intragroup comparisons, microbial counts decreased significantly from all six groups, S1 to S2. The maximum reduction was seen in Group III, followed by Group VI, Group V, Group II, and Group I; Group IV showed the least reduction. Group III showed statistically significant differences compared to the other experimental groups, and Group VI also showed significant differences compared to Groups I and IV. CONCLUSION: It was observed that UA was most successful in decreasing microorganisms, while NaOCl outperformed CHX in terms of antibacterial efficacy. Therefore, NaOCl with UA could be considered a highly effective disinfection protocol in endodontics.",
    "Identification and characterization of novel antimicrobial peptides from Camelus dromedarius: a combined bioinformatics and experimental study.. Al-Mamari W, Elhag Y, Al Bulushi S, Rekha RS, Mörman C, Bergman P, Al-Ansari A, Al-Adwani S (2026). There is an urgent need for new antimicrobial agents to address the emerging antimicrobial resistance and the lack of novel antibiotics on the market. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have gained significant interest as potential antibiotics over the past 30 years due to their broad activity against bacteria. So far, the presence, characteristics, and function of AMPs in camel immunity remain to be explored. Therefore, this study aims to identify and functionally characterize AMPs in Camelus Dromedarius using in-silico and experimental approaches. In-silico identification and prediction of cathelicidin peptides properties were conducted using Blastp, Conserved Domain, Signal P-5.0, Peptide Cutter-Expasy, and the Antimicrobial Sequence Scanning System (AMPA) database. Physicochemical and biological properties were characterized using bioinformatics analysis tools. The experimental assays of synthetic AMPs were performed using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, colony-forming assay, sytox green uptake assay, transmission and scanning electron microscopy, and hemolysis assay. Three cathelicidin peptides were identified from Camelus Dromedarius which were designated as CdPMAP-23, Cdprotegrin-3 (CdPG-3), and Cdcathelin-like (CdCATH). CdPG-3 and CdCATH demonstrated significant antibacterial effects against all tested Gram-negative and Gram-positive strains, including Escherichia. coli (Multidrug resistant) and Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 700699). These two peptides caused significant membrane leakage and damage to Escherichia. coli (ATCC 25922), with CdPMAP-23 showing a lesser effect. Lower concentrations of CdPMAP-23, CdPG-3 and CdCATH exhibited low to moderate lytic activity against red blood cells in humans, camels, and chickens. This study identified novel AMPs from dromedary camels with potential therapeutic value against multidrug-resistant strains. The results show that AMPs are present in dromedary camels, setting out a foundation for further studies on the unique features of their innate immune system.",
    "Development of a rapid, simple multiplex PCR-dipstick assay for the detection of Neisseria meningitidis serogroups in clinical isolates.. Matsuba M, Mahazu S, Shimuta K, Ablordey A, Takahashi H, Saito R (2025). The rapid identification and serogrouping of Neisseria meningitidis are crucial for effectively managing invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) patients and their close contacts, particularly in developing countries with limited laboratory resources. We developed a simple multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-dipstick DNA chromatography (mPCR-dipstick) assay for detecting six major serogroups (A, B, C, W, Y, and X) prevalent worldwide. The assay performance, sensitivity, and specificity were evaluated using 116 unencapsulated and encapsulated N. meningitidis, 29 other Neisseria spp., and 11 non-Neisseria spp. strains. The mPCR-dipstick assay successfully identified all unencapsulated and encapsulated N. meningitidis strains and accurately differentiated the six major serogroups. The detection limit was 4.1 × 104 genome copies and 5.3-266 colony-forming units (CFU) per reaction, indicating 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity. This convenient, sensitive, and rapid assay provides considerable advantages for diagnosing, treating, and controlling meningococcal infections in resource-limited settings, especially in high IMD endemic regions, including West Africa.",
    "YY1-Mediated Polycomb Group Function Safeguards Hematopoietic Stem Cells from Premature Aging.. Saka S, Lee JP, Wang Y, Liu P, Liu Y, Hong C, Kuehnl A, Rui L, Atchison ML, Pan X (2026). Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) undergo functional decline with age, characterized by myeloid-biased differentiation, loss of quiescence, and altered metabolic homeostasis. The molecular mechanisms driving these changes remain incompletely understood. Yin Yang 1 (YY1) is a multifunctional transcription factor and mammalian Polycomb group (PcG) protein that recruits PcG complexes to specific genomic loci via its 26-amino acid REPO (Recruitment of Polycomb) domain. To define the role of YY1 PcG function in adult HSCs, we generated a conditional YY1 REPO domain knockout mouse model ( Yy1 -/ΔREPO ). Deletion of the REPO domain led to premature HSC aging, with expansion of immunophenotypic HSCs but loss of long-term self-renewal capacity. Yy1 -/ΔREPO HSCs exhibited myeloid-biased output, expansion of myeloid-primed multipotent progenitors, increased myeloid colony formation, and an elevated myeloid-to-lymphoid ratio in peripheral blood. These cells displayed reduced quiescence, elevated reactive oxygen species, increased mitochondrial oxidative capacity, and enhanced β-galactosidase activity-hallmarks of cellular aging. RNA-seq demonstrated dysregulation of gene networks governing HSC metabolism. Together, these findings establish YY1 PcG activity as a key epigenetic mechanism that preserves metabolic quiescence, sustains long-term self-renewal, and delays HSC aging. Our studies reveal a fundamental PcG-dependent epigenetic mechanism that dictate cell fate decisions and function decline during HSC aging.",
    "Age dependent impairment of home cage behavior and reactivity in Cntnap2 knock out mouse model.. Sheridan M, Rice M, Mahadeshwar R, Kanamarlapudi A, Gross C, Tiwari D (2026). UNLABELLED: Contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CNTNAP2) is a transmembrane protein that mediates neuron-glia interactions and regulates dendritic spine growth and neuronal migration. Mutations in the CNTNAP2 gene are linked to autism and epilepsy. Younger Cntnap2 KO mice mimic autism phenotypes, while older mice are a model for epilepsy. Thus, comparing behavioral phenotypes across different ages is needed to better understand the age dependent development of disordered brain networks in Cntnap2 mutants. Male and female Cntnap2 KO and WT controls were tested across different age groups (4, 5, 7, 9, and ∼11 months) using digging, stimulus (reactivity), and nesting assays. Older Cntnap2 KO mice (7, 9, and ∼11 months) showed a significant increase in home cage reactivity (stimulus) assay compared to younger mice at 4 and 5 months of age. Similar trends were observed in male and female Cntnap2 KO mice. No significant differences were observed in WT controls. A significant difference in digging assay was observed in KO female mice between younger (4 month) and older mice post nest removal. An age-dependent significant reduction in nesting behavior was observed in female KO mice; however, no difference was observed in the WT controls. Immunohistochemical analysis showed age dependent change interneuron and microglial network in Cntnap2 KO mice. Our findings suggest disruption in home cage behavior and reactivity in older pre-epileptic Cntnap2 KO mice indicating an age-dependent network alteration and behavior deficits. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This study investigates the age-dependent behavioral changes in Cntnap2 KO mice due to underlying changes in the neuronal network. It has been shown that younger Cntnap2 KO mice display autistic behaviors and that older Cntnap2 KO mice have epilepsy, but it is unknown how behavior is affected during the intervening period of epileptogenesis. We find that female Cntnap2 KO mice at 11 months of age have increased reactivity and decreased motor activity compared to younger age groups, whereas WT mice show no relationship between age and behavior. Overall, the loss of Cntnap2 alters behavior in an age-dependent and sex-specific manner, indicating progressive dysregulation of the neuronal network.",

    "Synopsis of the myrmecophilous genus Ecitonides Wasmann (Coleoptera, Staphylinidae, Paederinae), with description of two new species from Brazil.. Montanhini A, Żyła D, Biffi G (2026). The Neotropical genus of myrmecophilous beetles, Ecitonides Wasmann, 1894 (Staphylinidae: Paederinae: Lathrobiini), currently includes nine valid species distributed in French Guiana, Suriname, Brazil, Peru, Paraguay, and Argentina. Members of this genus are notable for the tuberculate ornamentation on the head, thorax, and abdomen. Although little is known about the biology of these beetles, there are records of association with different species of army ants (Labidus Jurine, 1807 and Nomamyrmex Borgmeier, 1936). In this study, a detailed comparative morphological study of all available species for study was conducted, descriptions of two new species, Ecitonides colossus sp. nov. and Ecitonides splendidus sp. nov., are provided, and lectotypes for Ecitonides brevicornis Wasmann, 1900 and Ecitonides spectabilis Borgmeier, 1932 are designated. Diagnoses, illustrations, and photographs are given; an identification key is provided for all 11 species as well as new geographic distribution data. The aim of this study is to provide morphological data that will serve as a tool for a future investigation of the phylogenetic position of the genus and facilitate species recognition through diagnostic morphological characters and an identification key.",
    "Population Structure and Genetic Diversity Analyses Reveal Isolation That May Imperil the Northernmost Colony of the Endangered Australian Sea Lion.. Morris V, Chariton A, Harcourt R, Grueber CE, Charrier I, Raudino H, Waples K, Kirkwood R, Goldsworthy SD, Pitcher BJ (2026). Marine environments are experiencing rapid warming, substantially altering ecosystems. Populations at the edge of a species' range are more vulnerable to environmental change as they are first affected and may have limited dispersal opportunities. This vulnerability may be exacerbated in species with specialised foraging and breeding strategies. The Australian sea lion (Neophoca cinerea) is an endangered otariid species that breeds across a ~3000 km range in southern Australia. At the most north-westerly edge of the species' distribution, Australian sea lions breed across multiple islands within the Houtman Abrolhos Archipelago, Western Australia, a tropical-temperate location affected by marine heatwaves. This study aimed to examine the genetic structure and diversity of the Australian sea lions from the Houtman Abrolhos Archipelago compared to other populations in the species' range. One hundred and twenty-five individuals, 19 from Houtman Abrolhos, were genotyped from 19 sample sites across Western Australia and South Australia. Our findings showed that individuals from the Houtman Abrolhos grouped into a single population, which was highly differentiated and had extremely low genetic diversity. The isolation and limited genetic variation of the Houtman Abrolhos Australian sea lion population suggest that it is extremely vulnerable to extirpation. Our study highlights the vulnerability of isolated populations of a species to rapid environmental change and stochastic events.",
    "Effects of a high-power laser eye exposure on avian foraging behaviour: implications for the safety of laser bird deterrents.. Blumenthal A, Harris D, Moore BA, Melvin EF, Fernández-Juricic E (2026). To prevent human-bird conflict, lasers have been developed as nonlethal wildlife control methods despite being known to cause eye injury in humans. However, little is known about how much laser exposure can affect visually driven activities critical for survival, such as foraging. We assessed how laser exposure and its output energy affected avian visual exploratory behaviour during foraging and food consumption. We exposed house sparrows to a high-energy laser (Seabird Saver) under controlled conditions and measured within Week 1 after exposure and within Week 2 after exposure their foraging behaviour when visually locating millet seeds against a high contrast (easy task) and low contrast (difficult task) background. We found that house sparrows arrived at the food patch quicker and decreased their use of binocular vision within Week 1 after exposure compared to before exposure. Within Week 1 and within Week 2 after exposure, birds changed their rates of scanning depending on the difficulty of the foraging task. They also developed laterality by increasing foveal (i.e. high acuity) visual exploration rate using more the left compared to the right eye, particularly with increasing laser energy levels. Laser exposure increased pecking rates and seed consumption rates both within Week 1 and within Week 2 after exposure. This result is consistent with variations in body mass, which decreased markedly right after laser exposure, but animals recovered their pre-exposure weight over a few days. Our findings suggest that exposure to a high-energy laser (Seabird Saver) can alter visual exploratory behaviour in the context of foraging and influence foraging effort and food consumption rates. We discuss the implications for the use of lasers as wild bird deterrents at airports, landfills, fisheries, etc.",
    "Anti-Campylobacter Activity of Ternary Copper(II) Complexes with Imine Ligands and 4'-(4-Methylphenyl)-2,2':6',2″-Terpyridine.. Takeuchi MG, Ferreira ALM, Ramos LMS, Peixoto JLM, Chueiri MC, Dumont CF, Ferreira GRA, de Jesus DM, Ramos TDS, Bogado AL, Pereira GM, Portes MC, Corbi PP, Ferreira AMDC, Rossi DA, Guerra W, de Melo RT (2026). Herein, two Cu-(II) complexes of the type [Cu-(N-N)-(mftpy)]-(PF6)2 (N-N = 4-chloro-N-(pyridin-2-methylene) aniline (Clmp) or 4-methyl-N-(pyridin-2-methylene) aniline (memp)-and mftpy = 4'-(4-methylphenyl)-2,2':6',2″-terpyridine) were successfully synthesized and characterized by microanalysis (% CHN), high-resolution mass spectrometry, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and ultraviolet-visible (solution and solid state) and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopies (solution and solid state). Next, the in vitro antibacterial activity of the [Cu-(Clmp)-(mftpy)]-(PF6)2 CL1 and [Cu-(memp)-(mftpy)]-(PF6)2 CL2 complexes was investigated in the planktonic and sessile form of Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli strains selected from a bank of strains characterized by resistance to first-line antibiotics. The quantification of planktonic cells showed a reduction that varied from 1.3 to 6.9 log CFU (colony forming units)/mL at a minimum inhibitory concentration of 25-400 μg/mL according to the tested strain. The biofilms suffered modification in their ultrastructure and showed evidence of the action of both complexes that surpassed the results with peracetic acid, with a reduction ≥2.6 log CFU/mL of sessile Campylobacter, with control of 1.2 orders of magnitude in the biomass formation by CL2, and the highest penetration (4.92 μg) of CL1 into the C. jejuni biofilm. The results identified show that both complexes are biologically active, activating processes that allow the control of the pathogen in both lifestyles.",
    "Coral tissue depth reconstructed using skeletal microstructural offsets is driven by environmental stress.. Vincent J, Sheldrake T (2026). Coral tissue depth reflects organismal health and is influenced by environmental stressors. Reconstructing its past variability on inter- and intra-annual timescales, however, is not yet possible. Here we reconstructed seasonal tissue depth by measuring spatial offsets between growth cycles in corallite porosity and theca geochemistry (Lithium/Magnesium and Barium/Calcium ratios) of a single Siderastrea siderea core collected in Barbados. We show spatial offsets and thus tissue depth vary systematically over multiyear timescales, with decreasing values associated with thermal stress that impact extension rate and calcification in subsequent growth cycles. Large environmental disturbances such as the 2021 volcanic eruption of La Soufrière (St. Vincent) also impact tissue depth, in this case likely due to the release of bioactive metals upon ash deposition. This study investigates the robustness of the offset signal within a single colony and with further validation across multiple colonies could help reconstruct regional to global environmental and ecological stressors.",
    "A brain-constrained neural model of cognition and language with NEST: transitioning from the Felix framework.. Carriere M, Dobler F, Plesser HE, Feledyn A, Tomasello R, Wennekers T, Pulvermüller F (2026). UNLABELLED: We introduce a brain-constrained neurocomputational model designed to simulate higher cognitive functions of the human brain, implemented using NEST, a widely used open-source simulator optimised for high-performance spiking neural network simulations. Previously implemented in the custom-built C-based Felix simulation library, transitioning the model to NEST enhances accessibility, reproducibility, and computational efficiency. At the cellular level, the model comprises spiking excitatory neurons and local inhibitory neurons, whereas at the network level, it replicates the structural and functional organisation of 12 cortical regions spanning frontal, temporal, and occipital cortices, along with their associated inter-area connectivity. Additionally, global inhibition mechanisms and neuronal noise are integrated. Learning in the model follows biologically plausible Hebbian plasticity principles, incorporating both long-term potentiation and long-term depression. To validate the NEST implementation, we replicated previous simulation findings obtained with the Felix-based model. The new implementation successfully reproduced the same topographical distribution of cell assemblies following associative learning of object and action words within action and perception systems, replicating a range of previous neuroimaging results. Although the NEST model produced larger cell assemblies than Felix, the overall topographical patterns remained similar, indicating preservation of fundamental network characteristics. Moreover, the transition to NEST significantly enhanced computational efficiency, reducing simulation runtime nearly sixfold compared to Felix. This improvement in computational speed is crucial for expanding the model to include additional cortical regions, such as extending to the right hemisphere, which necessitates increased computational resources. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11571-026-10415-5.",
    "Increasing autophagy activity suppresses Helicobacter pylori infection-related gastric cancer tumorigenesis both in vitro and in vivo.. Lin PW, Liu YW, Chu ML, Chen YC, Shih YH, Ma YC, Lin PY, Kuo IY, Chang HY, Chen LT, Wang JY, Lee YR, Kuo CH, Wu DC, Liu HS (2026). Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is a major risk factor for gastric cancer (GC). Although autophagy is involved in H. pylori infection, its role in H. pylori-associated tumorigenesis remains unclear. Here, we investigated whether enhancing autophagy suppresses GC malignancy under H. pylori infection. Autophagy and mitochondrial markers were analyzed in GC tissue microarrays and the TCGA-STAD dataset. Functional studies employed H. pylori (strain 49503)-infected GC cell lines and xenograft models, with autophagy manipulated by pharmacological induction, Atg5 knockout, gene silencing, or overexpression. Molecular and cellular analyses included Western blotting, luciferase reporter assays, RNA sequencing, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), mitochondrial function tests, and additional functional assays. We observed elevated levels of LC3 and p-Drp1 in tumor tissues. H. pylori infection increased autophagy, cell migration, sphere formation, and transient tumor growth, while reducing cell viability and colony formation; autophagy induction suppressed these malignant features. TEM revealed abundant autophagy-like vesicles and mitochondrial alterations in infected cells. Mechanistically, H. pylori activated the Erk1/2 and JNK signaling pathways to induce autophagy while inhibiting other oncogenic signaling pathways. Notably, although H. pylori induces robust autophagy, further enhancement of this process using autophagy inducers attenuated gastric cancer malignancy, suggesting that further pharmacological modulation of autophagy warrants evaluation as a potential therapeutic strategy.",
    "Integrative multi-omics and experimental analyses implicate PTK2 as a lorazepam-associated biomarker and potential therapeutic target in ovarian cancer.. Hong X, He X, He S (2025). BACKGROUND: Ovarian cancer remains one of the most lethal gynecologic malignancies, characterized by high recurrence rates and chemoresistance. Recent advances suggest that neuroactive drugs such as lorazepam may exert off-target molecular effects beyond the central nervous system. However, their pharmacological relevance in tumor biology remains largely unexplored. This study aimed to identify and validate shared molecular targets of lorazepam and ovarian cancer, uncovering novel biomarkers and therapeutic mechanisms. METHODS: Potential lorazepam targets were retrieved from the CTD, STITCH, and SwissTargetPrediction databases and cross-referenced with ovarian cancer-related genes from GeneCards. Bioinformatic analyses were conducted, including target screening, protein-protein interaction network construction, Lasso-Cox modeling, and functional enrichment. We further performed immune infiltration profiling, single-cell and spatial transcriptomics analyses, followed by experimental validation using qPCR, CCK-8, colony formation, wound-healing, and flow cytometry assays. RESULTS: Fifty-one overlapping genes were identified between lorazepam and ovarian cancer, with PTK2 emerging as a central hub gene. PTK2 overexpression was significantly associated with poor prognosis, enhanced immune activation, stromal remodeling, and metabolic reprogramming. Spatial transcriptomics revealed PTK2 enrichment in malignant and fibroblast-rich regions. Functional assays confirmed that stable PTK2 knockdown inhibited proliferation, colony formation, and migration while promoting apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that PTK2 may act as a putative oncogenic mediator and potential pharmacological link between lorazepam signaling and ovarian cancer progression. PTK2 functions as a biomarker and druggable target that integrates tumor growth, immune modulation, and metabolic adaptation. Targeting PTK2 may provide a promising therapeutic strategy for precision oncology and rational drug repurposing.",
    "The genome sequence of the Chalk Yellow-face Bee, Hylaeus dilatatus (Kirby, 1802) (Hymenoptera: Colletidae).. Boyes C, Natural History Museum Genome Acquisition Lab, Darwin Tree of Life Barcoding Collective, Wellcome Sanger Institute Tree of Life Management, Samples and Laboratory team, Wellcome Sanger Institute Scientific Operations: Sequencing Operations, Wellcome Sanger Institute Tree of Life Core Informatics team, Tree of Life Core Informatics collective, Darwin Tree of Life Consortium (2026). We present a genome assembly from an individual female Hylaeus dilatatus (Chalk Yellow-face Bee; Arthropoda; Insecta; Hymenoptera; Colletidae). The assembly contains two haplotypes with total lengths of 307.38 megabases and 314.32 megabases. Most of haplotype 1 (82.9%) is scaffolded into 12 chromosomal pseudomolecules. Most of haplotype 2 (73.52%) is scaffolded into 12 chromosomal pseudomolecules. The mitochondrial genome has also been assembled, with a length of 17.78 kilobases. This assembly was generated as part of the Darwin Tree of Life project, which produces reference genomes for eukaryotic species found in Britain and Ireland.",
    "Direct artificial selection for longevity in the parasitic wasp Pachycrepoideus vindemmiae (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae) enhances lifespan and fitness traits as a biological control agent.. Teng Z, Wang Y, Huang Y, Wang X, Wan F, Zhou H (2026). Longevity critically influences biocontrol efficacy, yet direct artificial selection for lifespan extension has rarely been documented in natural enemies. Here, we established long-lived lines of the parasitoid wasp Pachycrepoideus vindemmiae through artificial selection and investigated their phenotypic and genomic consequences. Two longevity-selected lines (LL1 and LL2) and their corresponding original control lines (OL1 and OL2) were generated. Females of LL1 showed a significantly extended lifespan by the fifth generation, whereas LL2 did not respond to selection. Notably, the longevity advantage of LL1 females persisted at generations 15 and 33 after cessation of selection. LL1 females also exhibited increased lifetime fecundity and enhanced resistance to cold and starvation, without changes in developmental duration, sex ratio, or body size. To explore the genetic basis of these traits, whole-genome resequencing was conducted on females and males from LL1 and OL1 at generation 33. Population genomic analyses revealed clear genetic differentiation between lines but not between sexes within lines. Selective sweep analyses in females identified genomic regions under selection enriched in energy metabolism and stress regulation, and integration with expression data revealed SNP variation and line-specific cold-induced expression of heat shock protein genes. Together, these results indicate that artificial selection can potentially produce a stable extension of female lifespan in P. vindemmiae, accompanied by distinct genomic signatures in the responsive line. Our findings provide insights into the genetic architecture of longevity and stress resistance in parasitoid wasps while highlighting both the opportunities and constraints of artificial selection for biological control improvement.",
    "Bone Marrow Colony Stimulating Factors (CSF) and Stem Cell Therapy as Medical Countermeasures (MCM) for Treatment of Hematopoietic-Acute Radiation Syndrome: A Systematic Review.. Bogis A, Pulver S, Charp P, Wills E, Kazzi Z, Buzzell J, Prasher JM, Chang A (2026). OBJECTIVES: A nuclear detonation resulting in radiation exposure to a large population can cause acute radiation syndrome (ARS). Bone marrow colony stimulating factors (CSF), also known as cytokines, are FDA approved to treat hematopoietic-acute radiation syndrome (H-ARS). This review characterizes the use of CSFs (filgrastim, pegfilgrastim, romiplostim, and sargramostim) and stem cell therapies for H-ARS. METHODS: Using identified keywords, the literature search was conducted on biomedical databases from January 1996-July 2022 and returned 7452 articles. However, after review based on PICO and exclusion criteria, a total of 39 animal studies were included in this systematic review. RESULTS: Data synthesis using vote counting demonstrated that 34 of 39 studies reported benefit with CSFs or stem cell therapies based on an increase in percent survival or physiological improvement in the experimental group when compared to the control (87% [95% CI 71.77%-95.18%], P = <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: While studies looking at efficacy of CSFs given after 24 hours were limited, 2 studies included in this review showed that delayed administration of CSFs up to 120 hours may be beneficial compared to no treatment. Lack of standardization in experimental study design (e.g. radiation doses, animal species, interventions) between studies prevented direct comparisons using meta-analytic statistical approach.",
    "MUC14 suppresses lung adenocarcinoma via integrin α8β6/PI3K/AKT/MAPK modulating cisplatin response and immunity.. Li X, Li M, Huang S, Zhang Z, Xing C, Yu S, Han G (2026). MUC14/Endomucin, a transmembrane mucin, is a potential prognostic biomarker in malignancies. This study aimed to elucidate the functional impact of MUC14 on tumor proliferation, migration, immune microenvironment modulation, and cisplatin response in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), and investigate its molecular mechanisms. LUAD cell lines with MUC14 overexpression (MUC14-OE) or silencing were constructed. Malignant behaviors were assessed via CCK-8, Transwell, and colony formation assays. Immune cell infiltration was quantified by CD3+/CD8 + immunohistochemistry. Subcutaneous xenograft and tail-vein metastasis murine models evaluated in vivo tumor progression and cisplatin responsiveness. Mechanisms were characterized using FRET and western blotting. Multiplatform bioinformatics analysis of public databases correlated MUC14 expression with clinical outcomes, immune infiltration, and chemotherapy response. MUC14-OE inhibited LUAD cell proliferation, migration, colony formation, and adhesion, while silencing promoted these phenotypes. MUC14 expression positively correlated with CD3+/CD8 + T-cell infiltration. In vivo, MUC14-OE suppressed subcutaneous tumor growth, lung metastasis, and enhanced cisplatin efficacy. Mechanistically, MUC14 inhibited integrin α8β6 clustering, suppressing PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK signaling. Cisplatin sensitization involved JNK/c-Jun pathway activation. This study establishes MUC14 as a multifunctional tumor suppressor in LUAD. It inhibits integrin α8β6-mediated PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK signaling to suppress tumor growth, promotes CD8+ T-cell infiltration, and augments cisplatin sensitivity via the JNK/c-Jun pathway. These findings nominate MUC14 as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target, suggesting combinatorial strategies integrating immunotherapy and chemotherapy.",
    "Cryptocercus genomes expand knowledge of adaptations to xylophagy and termite sociality.. Jones ARC, Mikhailova AA, Aumont C, Berger J, Liu C, He S, Wang Z, Winkler S, Bornberg-Bauer E, Legendre F, McMahon DP, Harrison MC (2026). Subsociality and wood-eating or xylophagy are understood as key drivers in the evolution of eusociality in Blattodea (cockroaches and termites), two features observed in the cockroach genus Cryptocercus, the sister group of all termites. We analyse two high-quality genomes from this genus, C. punctulatus from North America and C. meridianus from Southeast Asia, to explore the evolutionary transitions to xylophagy and subsociality within Blattodea. Our analyses reveal evidence of relaxed selection in both Cryptocercus and termites, indicating that a reduction in effective population size may have occurred in their subsocial ancestors. These findings challenge the expected positive correlation between dN/dS ratios and social complexity, as Cryptocercus exhibits elevated dN/dS values that may exceed those of eusocial termites. Additionally, we infer a reduction in the number of Ionotropic Receptors and a change from uni- to bimodal methylation signatures in protein coding genes in a common ancestor of Cryptocercus and termites, mechanisms previously thought to have evolved with the emergence of eusociality in termites. Future studies incorporating additional genomic data from diverse blattodean species can further build on these findings and provide deeper insights into the molecular mechanisms driving transitions to xylophagy and eusociality.",
    "Consequences of heterothermy during development on the physiology and growth of Antarctic storm-petrel chicks.. Kuepper ND, Czirják GÁ, Libertelli MM, Quillfeldt P (2026). The ability to endure a wide range of body temperatures, called heterothermy, offers many species worldwide the possibility to survive times of malnourishment by lowering metabolic rate and body temperature. During development, facultative hypothermia and therefore lowered body temperatures might have disadvantages. Our study aimed at identifying potential trade-offs between the use of facultative hypothermia and investment into growth, immunity, and nutritional physiology in chicks of an Antarctic seabird, the Wilson's Storm-petrel (Oceanites oceanicus). To answer these questions, we used the irregular occurrence of facultative hypothermia of chicks from a free-living colony breeding on the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica. Our study showed that chicks experiencing lower body temperatures or snowstorms had slower growth, fewer circulating leukocytes, and lower triglyceride concentrations. These findings suggest reduced investment into physiology and growth during events of facultative hypothermia. Patterns of wing growth following facultative hypothermia suggest that chicks may recover within little time after feeding and rewarming. For other parameters, more data of intervals with facultative hypothermic body temperatures followed by normothermy are needed to allow similar conclusions. Our results suggest that while heterothermy seems a beneficial strategy for chick survival in this species, it incurs partially reversible trade-offs with other physiological traits.",
    "U07, a novel oridonin derivative, targets polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4) to induce ferroptosis in gastric cancer cells.. Huang Y, Lin Y, Zhou Q, Liang Y, Lu M, Wu F, Dong Q, Cheng J (2026). This study aimed to systematically investigate the inhibitory effect and potential molecular mechanism of oridonin derivative U07 on gastric cancer cells. By combining in vitro cell experiments and in vivo animal experiments, techniques including Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, colony formation assay, Annexin V-FITC/Propidium Iodide (Annexin V/PI) double-staining flow cytometry, Western blot, wound healing assay, Transwell invasion assay, fluorescence staining, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and molecular docking were used to analyze the impact of U07 on the biological behavior of gastric cancer cells and related molecular pathways. The results showed that U07 exhibited concentration-dependent cytotoxicity against HGC-27 and MKN-45 gastric cancer cells (with IC50 values of 2.5 μM and 2.6 μM, respectively). It could inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis by activating the caspase-3 pathway, while significantly reducing cell migration and invasion abilities. U07 concentration-dependently increased the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation, decreased glutathione (GSH) content, and increased malondialdehyde (MDA) content, thereby triggering ferroptosis; this effect could be blocked by the ferroptosis inhibitor Fer-1. Molecular studies confirmed that U07 could specifically bind to PLK4 kinase (KD = 6.2 μM detected by SPR, Kd = 0.65 μM detected by ITC) and inhibit its activity. PLK4 negatively regulates frroptosis pathway by directly binding to and transcriptionally activating Glutathione Peroxidase 4 (GPX4) / ferritin heavy chain 1 (FTH1). By downregulating PLK4, U07 further reduced the expression of ferroptosis marker proteins GPX4 and FTH1, and promoted lipid peroxidation and ROS production; however, overexpression of PLK4 could reverse these effects. In vivo experiments demonstrated that U07 could inhibit tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner, with the high-dose group (6 mg) showing an anti-tumor effect comparable to that of cisplatin, and it could downregulate the expression of PLK4 and GPX4 in tumor tissues. In conclusion, the oridonin derivative U07 exerts anti-gastric cancer effects by inhibiting cell proliferation, inducing apoptosis, and mediating ferroptosis via PLK4, providing a new candidate drug and therapeutic target for gastric cancer treatment.",
    "Lipid-based nanocarriers coupled with CO(2) laser-mediated drug delivery enhance skin penetration and hair follicle targeting.. Lee WR, Chou WL, Hsiao CY, Alshetaili A, Chang FH, Fang JY (2026). The topical administration of hydrophilic drugs such as minoxidil and minocycline for alopecia and acne treatments remains unsatisfactory due to limited skin absorption and follicular uptake. The combination of physical and chemical enhancement methods may be beneficial in improving skin delivery. In this study, minoxidil and minocycline were topically delivered in nanoparticulate form to penetrate the skin using fractional laser microporation. Skin perforation was conducted on pig skin with a CO2 laser (2-8 mJ). The lipid-based nanocarriers increased the passive absorption of the drugs as compared to the free form, with a particularly significant increase in flux. The laser enhanced the skin deposition and flux of both free and nanoencapsulated drugs. The follicular accumulation of minoxidil in nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) and liposomes (LP) was increased by 7- and 9-fold, respectively, with laser treatment. The laser also enhanced follicular minocycline accumulation in NLC and LP by 9- and 12-fold, respectively, compared to passive transport. Biodistribution observed through confocal microscopy illustrated that the nanoparticles were primarily transported through the laser-created microchannels, with both vertical and horizontal diffusion. After CO2 laser exposure, the nanoparticles were visualised in both epidermal and dermal layers. In an in vivo Cutibacterium acnes-infected mouse model, a 2-log reduction in bacterial colony in the skin was observed with the combined laser and NLC. Our preclinical evidence demonstrates that the combination of laser ablation with specific nanoformulations appears to be an effective and safe strategy for cutaneous and follicular delivery of hydrophilic drugs.",
    "KLF11 interacts with MDM2 to stabilize E2F1 and promotes DNA damage repair to induce radioresistance in esophageal cancer cells.. Xia Y, Wang J, Zhao D, Li Y, Li S, Li M, Dong R, Wang L (2026). OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the function of KLF11 in regulating radiosensitivity (RT) in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: A nude mouse ESCC xenograft model was established by injecting KYSE150 cells into the left dorsal flank. Cell proliferation was assessed using cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and colony formation assays, while DNA damage was evaluated via a neutral comet assay. Key gene and protein expression levels were analyzed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. Additionally, coimmunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence were employed to validate proteinprotein interactions. RESULTS: KLF11 expression was upregulated in both ESCC and RT-resistant tissues. At the cellular level, KLF11 expression was higher in ESCC cell lines than in the normal esophageal epithelial cell line HET-1A, with the most pronounced upregulation in KYSE150 cells and the least in TE1 cells. Notably, KLF11 knockdown under ionizing radiation exposure suppressed proliferation and colony formation, promoted apoptosis, and increased the expression of the DNA damage marker γ-H2AX as well as overall DNA damage levels in KYSE150 cells. Conversely, KLF11 overexpression in TE1 cells led to the opposite phenotype, suggesting that KLF11 confers RT resistance in ESCC by mitigating DNA damage. Further investigations revealed that KLF11 primarily repairs RT-induced DNA damage through the homologous recombination (HR) pathway rather than through nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). Additionally, the expression of MDM2, E2F1, and RAD51 was significantly elevated in ESCC and RT-resistant ESCC tissues. Mechanistically, KLF11 promotes MDM2 expression, which inhibits E2F1 ubiquitination, thereby stabilizing E2F1 protein levels and enhancing RAD51-mediated HR repair, ultimately leading to RT resistance in ESCC. CONCLUSION: This study elucidates the critical role and molecular mechanism through which KLF11 drives radiotherapy resistance in ESCC by regulating the MDM2/E2F1 axis and enhancing HR repair, thereby providing a solid theoretical foundation and potential target for the development of KLF11-targeted radiosensitization therapies for ESCC.",
    "From Aortitis to Sweet's: The Immune Spectrum of G-CSF Adverse Events.. de Carvalho JF, Caldas CAM (2026). BACKGROUND: Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and its PEGylated formulation (pegfilgrastim) are indispensable for preventing chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and for stem-cell mobilization. Beyond hematopoiesis, G-CSF modulates innate/adaptive immunity and may precipitate immune-mediated events in susceptible hosts. Clinical signals span large-vessel vasculitis/aortitis and non-vascular neutrophil-dominant phenotypes, yet timing, spectrum, and management remain variably characterized. OBJECTIVE: To identify and synthesize primary clinical reports of autoimmune/rheumatic disease triggered or exacerbated by exogenous G-CSF (filgrastim or pegfilgrastim), describing phenotypes, latency, management, outcomes, and implications for practice. METHODS: We performed a narrative review of primary clinical studies, including observational cohorts and case reports or short case series, identified through targeted searches of PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Embase, complemented by investigator-curated references. Eligible reports described autoimmune, inflammatory, or rheumatic manifestations occurring after exposure to exogenous G-CSF. Predefined phenotypes included large-vessel vasculitis/aortitis; neutrophilic dermatoses (e.g., Sweet's syndrome, neutrophilic dermatosis of the dorsal hands); cutaneous small-vessel vasculitis; inflammatory or crystal arthritis (e.g., calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease); pulmonary inflammatory injury (e.g., diffuse alveolar hemorrhage); and clear flares of established autoimmune disease. Narrative or mechanistic reviews and trials of GM-CSF pathway blockade were excluded from qualitative synthesis. RESULTS: Twenty-four studies met inclusion criteria: two observational cohorts and twenty-two single-patient reports/short series. Cohorts quantified a low but reproducible burden of pegfilgrastim-associated aortitis, with stereotyped involvement of the aortic arch/proximal branches and typical latency of 7-15 days. Case-level data confirmed marked elevation of acute phase reactants, usually negative autoantibodies, favorable outcomes after G-CSF withdrawal with or without short glucocorticoid courses, and recurrence/migration on re-exposure. Non-vascular events clustered earlier (2-7 days) and included biopsy-proven Sweet's/NDDH, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, CPPD flares, and rare diffuse alveolar hemorrhage; granulomatous dermatitis and perioperative pyoderma gangrenosum were also observed. Re-exposure information suggested phenotype-specific risk: recurrent CPPD with pegfilgrastim was mitigated by switching to short-acting filgrastim; selected limited aortitis resolved without steroids; refractory aortitis responded to IL-6 blockade, enabling uninterrupted chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Exogenous G-CSF can precipitate a coherent spectrum of immune-mediated toxicity with distinct, clinically actionable timing windows: vascular events peak 7-15 days after pegfilgrastim, whereas cutaneous, articular, and pulmonary manifestations arise within 2-7 days. Recognition hinges on temporal linkage, imaging/histology, and exclusion of mimics. Management is phenotype-aware-drug withdrawal ± short glucocorticoids, formulation switching for CPPD, and targeted IL-6 blockade in selected refractory aortitis-allowing preservation of hematologic benefits while minimizing immune toxicity. Prospective surveillance and structured re-exposure studies (including formulation tailoring) are priorities to move from signal detection to prevention.",
    "Use of concomitant G-CSF in maintaining efficacious dose and safe delivery of docetaxel in combination with darolutamide in ARASENS: A phase III study.. Ong M, Suzuki H, Smith M, Tombal B, Hussain M, Saad F, Fizazi K, Verholen F, Pham H, Srinivasan S, Lalani AA (2026). BACKGROUND: We assessed the impact of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) use and docetaxel relative dose intensity (RDI) on the safety profile of the ARASENS (NCT02799602) triplet regimen with darolutamide in patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. METHODS: Patients were randomized to darolutamide 600 mg orally twice daily or placebo, with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and docetaxel. Baseline characteristics, G-CSF use, and safety were analyzed according to docetaxel RDI (≤85 % vs >85 %). RESULTS: Of 1273 patients with docetaxel RDI data (darolutamide n = 637; placebo n = 636), > 97 % received an efficacious dose of docetaxel (RDI >80 %). Patient demographics and baseline disease characteristics were generally similar between RDI subgroups; > 60 % of patients with RDI ≤ 85 % were from the Asia-Pacific region. Concomitant G-CSF, with/without docetaxel dose modification, was used in 42.4 % (darolutamide) and 44.6 % (placebo) of patients, mainly as secondary prophylaxis; 61.3 % (darolutamide) and 64.4 % (placebo) received both docetaxel dose modifications and G-CSF. Grade ≥ 3 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), grade ≥ 3 neutropenia, and grade ≥ 3 febrile neutropenia were higher with docetaxel RDI ≤ 85 %, but docetaxel discontinuation rates were similar between subgroups (RDI ≤85 %: darolutamide 7.2 %, placebo 10.8 %; RDI >85 %: darolutamide 8.1 %, placebo 10.5 %). TEAEs leading to docetaxel dose modification were more frequent with docetaxel RDI ≤ 85 % (darolutamide 92.8 %; placebo 97.3 %) versus RDI > 85 % (darolutamide 26.0 %; placebo 25.3 %). CONCLUSION: Appropriate docetaxel dose modifications and early G-CSF use allowed almost all patients to receive an efficacious dose of docetaxel in combination with darolutamide and ADT and may prevent neutropenic complications in patients receiving docetaxel.

    "Barriers to effective foot care: A mixed-methods assessment among persons with leprosy-related foot disabilities living in a leprosy colony in Bankura, West Bengal.. Seth S, Kundu MK, Roy S, Halder SK, Basu R, Paul B (2025). Background Leprosy-related foot ulceration remains a significant cause of disability despite the decline in global disease prevalence. Self-care practices are essential for preventing foot complications, particularly in resource-limited settings. Aim To assess foot care practices among leprosy-affected persons with foot disabilities and to explore the barriers to proper foot care among the study participants with unsatisfactory foot care practices Methods A community-based cross-sectional mixed-method study with an explanatory sequential design was conducted in a Leprosy Colony of Bankura, West Bengal from December 2023 to August 2024. For the quantitative strand, 104 leprosy-affected adults with Grade 1 and Grade 2 foot disabilities were interviewed using a predesigned, pretested semi-structured questionnaire. In-depth interviews were conducted among seven individual with unsatisfactory foot care practices, for the qualitative strand. Results The median foot care practice score was 5.5 (4, 7), with 84.6% of participants having unsatisfactory practices. Women (p?0.001), widowed/never married status (p?0.004), and Grade 1 foot disability (p?0.034) were significantly associated with unsatisfactory foot care. Qualitative exploration revealed three major barrier themes: cognitive (knowledge deficits, misconceptions, low perceived disease severity), socio-economic (lack of caregivers, insufficient income, forced long-distance walking), and product-related (gender-inappropriate footwear design, poor fit, limited durability). Limitations Conducting this study in a single leprosy colony and non-probabilistic sampling method may limit generalisability and self-reported data may subject to response bias. Conclusions Multiple interconnected factors influence foot care practices among leprosy-affected individuals. Interventions should address gender-specific barriers, enhance risk perception among those with milder disabilities, and improve the design, fit, and quality of protective footwear to reduce disability burden.",
    "Genetic affinities between the ancient Greek colony of Amvrakia and its metropolis.. Psonis N, Tabakaki E, Vassou D, Papadantonakis S, Souleles A, Nafplioti A, Kousis Tsampazis G, Papadopoulou A, Xanthopoulos K, Panailidis P, Georgiadou A, Papakosta D, Koursioti S, Evangelinou M, Papadopoulou V, Evaggeloglou P, Korka E, Christidis I, Ioannou M, Kontogianni T, Arkoumanis A, Stamatakis A, Poulakakis N, Papageorgopoulou C, Pavlidis P (2026). BACKGROUND: The complex historical phenomenon known as Greek colonization refers to the strategic establishment of new settlements (colonies) from the 8th to the early fourth century BCE. Unlike earlier migrations, this process was planned and driven by the need to expand trade, access resources, and develop economic as well as political networks. Corinth, a prominent commercial center in southern Greece, constitutes a prominent example for initiating colonization. By founding colonies, Corinth established a safe and continuous route for moving goods along the coasts of western mainland Greece and the Adriatic. Amvrakia was one of Corinth's principal colonies along this route in northwestern Greece. Founded in the seventh century BCE, Amvrakia was characterized by a strong dependence on its metropolis (Corinth). Here, we aim to investigate the genetic relationships between the Corinthian metropolis and the Amvrakia colony, the contribution of the local population to the founding genetic pool, as well as the demography of Amvrakia in subsequent periods. RESULTS: During its foundation in the Archaic period, Amvrakia appears to have been shaped by genetic influences from a single source. This source migrated from the Corinth territory, represented by the Archaic Tenea population and is supported via an Identity By Descent (IBD) analysis. A direct ancestry from Late Bronze Age (LBA) Greece, including a local LBA population represented by the Ammotopos site located in close proximity to Amvrakia, was not inferred despite conducting a plethora of independent population genomics analyses. During the subsequent Classical and Hellenistic periods, the population of Amvrakia appears to have only slightly differentiated and evidence of genetic continuity over time is observed. CONCLUSIONS: The migration of Corinthians to Amvrakia was the major contributor to the initial genetic pool of the colony, indicating that the Corinthian colonization included both genetic and cultural transmission between the metropolis and its colony.",
    "Vector competence re-evaluation of reared Glossina palpalis gambiensis for transmission of Trypanosoma congolense and Trypanosoma brucei brucei isolates for an experimental event.. Yaméogo TJ, Boulangé A, Salou WE, Belem AMG, Desquesnes M, Ravel S, Gimonneau G (2026). BACKGROUND: Tsetse flies (Diptera: Glossinidae) are vectors of human and animal trypanosomes. The Glossina palpalis gambiensis Burkina Faso (BKF) colony, established in 1972 and rejuvenated once in 1981, is a long-standing closed colony used extensively for research and vector control. While its performance and competitiveness for sterile insect technique (SIT) programs are regularly monitored, its vector competence (VC) data are outdated. This study aimed to update the VC data of this 47-year-old colony (from the onset of experiment in 2019) against Trypanosoma congolense and T. brucei brucei in laboratory conditions using trypanosome clone and tsetse fly individuals from the BKF colony. METHODS: Vector competence was studied by infecting rats with T. congolense IL1180 and T. b. brucei BE8P2P2, on which tsetse flies received their first blood meal. Dissections were subsequently performed at different time intervals. RESULTS: Following experimental infections with T. congolense IL1180, 10.58% (20/189) of G. p. gambiensis developed mature infections (trypanosomes in the proboscis), resulting in an average VC index of 0.106. For T. b. brucei BE8P2P2, 4.21% (11/261) of flies developed mature infections (trypanosomes in the salivary glands), yielding an average VC index of 0.042. CONCLUSIONS: The VC for T. b. brucei aligned with previous findings from 21 years ago, though a different trypanosome isolate was used at that time. However, using the same trypanosome strain, the observed competence for T. congolense was 4.8 times higher than previously reported. These results raise questions about the long-term effects of insectary rearing on VC, particularly in the absence of prolonged parasite exposure.",
    "Environmental drivers of bat activity at high latitudes.. Lilley TM, Vesterinen EJ, Vasko VV, Blomberg AS, Fjelldal MA (2026). UNLABELLED: In high-latitude ecosystems, insectivorous bats must make use of short nights during the summer, during which temperature and light conditions interact in non-linear ways. These abiotic dynamics directly influence insect availability and, in turn, bat activity. We examined the influence of night-time temperature and night length on the nightly and seasonal activity patterns of the northern bat (Eptesicus nilssonii) across Finland (60°–66°N), using passive acoustic monitoring data collected over 9,000 detector-nights across seven years. We predicted that bat activity would be constrained by low temperatures, strong winds or heavy rain, and that the nightly pattern would depend on an interaction between night length and weather conditions. Our results show activity peaked 1–2 h after sunset under most conditions, with ambient temperature strongly influencing overall activity levels. On short, warm nights, activity was relatively evenly distributed across the few hours of darkness, whereas long, warm nights produced a bimodal activity pattern with peaks after sunset and before sunrise. This dual-peaked pattern occurred only under thermal conditions that likely support sustained insect activity. In contrast, on colder or windier nights, activity was sharply concentrated to the first hours after sunset. Seasonal and latitudinal trends revealed that activity was most restricted in spring, particularly in northern regions, while the progressing summer expressed more evenly distributed patterns. In autumn, activity patterns diverged across latitudes, reflecting interactions between temperature and night length. The results of our study demonstrate that E. nilssonii may dynamically adjust its foraging behaviour in response to interacting abiotic constraints, optimizing energy gain while minimizing predation risk. Our findings quantify the environmental thresholds facilitating various activity patterns and provide rare evidence of bimodal nocturnal activity at high latitudes. Our study highlights the importance of large-scale, long-term monitoring for understanding how changing climatic conditions influence species behaviour in boreal ecosystems.

    "Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated kinase inhibition overcomes gemcitabine resistance in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma via DNA ligase I-dependent repair vulnerability.. Lin SH, Pan YR, Hung TH, Huang WK, Yeh CN (2026). Gemcitabine-based chemotherapy remains the standard first-line treatment for cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), but acquired resistance presents a significant clinical challenge. Synthetic lethality approaches targeting double-strand break repair (DSBR) pathways offer promising therapeutic opportunities. Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase, a central regulator of homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), is critical for maintaining genomic integrity following DNA damage. Here, we demonstrate that combining the ATM inhibitor AZD0156 with DNA-damaging agents (cisplatin or photon irradiation) significantly enhances cytotoxicity in gemcitabine-resistant intrahepatic CCA sublines (GR-iCCAs) while sparing gemcitabine-sensitive parental cells. This selective sensitization manifests in impaired colony formation, increased apoptosis, and persistent γ-H2AX nuclear accumulation. The magnitude of AZD0156 sensitization in GR cells substantially exceeds additive expectations, strongly suggesting synergistic interaction. Genetic ATM depletion in GR-iCCAs under genotoxic stress recapitulated these effects, confirming on-target specificity. Mechanistically, GR-iCCAs exhibit significantly reduced DNA ligase I (LIG1) expression, a critical component of the alternative NHEJ (alt-NHEJ) repair pathway, particularly under DNA damage conditions. Genetic restoration of LIG1 expression reversed AZD0156 sensitivity, establishing LIG1 deficiency as a key determinant modulating DNA repair pathway dependency. In xenograft models, AZD0156 combined with cisplatin substantially suppressed tumor growth compared to monotherapy, with acceptable tolerability profiles. These findings identify ATM inhibition as a promising strategy to overcome gemcitabine resistance in CCA, particularly in tumors with compromised alt-NHEJ repair capacity, providing a mechanistic rationale for clinical development of this combination therapy.",
    "Engineered soluble truncated envelope proteins block bovine leukemia virus infection.. Wanjala N, Matsumoto R, Pramono D, Miyake A, Nishigaki K (2026). Bovine leukemia virus (BLV), a member of the delta retrovirus family, is transmitted horizontally among cows. BLV causes enzootic bovine leukosis and has great economic impact on the cattle industry. Recently, secretory-defective Env proteins (e.g., Refrex-1 and FeLIX) have been detected in domestic cats and shown to possess antiretroviral activity against gammaretroviruses via viral receptor interference. Therefore, we investigated whether BLV-derived molecules engineered similarly exhibit antiviral activity against BLV infection. We generated several proteins consisting of the BLV envelope surface unit (SU) region and signal peptide, without the transmembrane region, and tested their inhibitory effects on BLV infection. These artificial mutant Env-SU proteins were detected as secreted proteins in cultured cells. Colony formation and quantitative PCR assays revealed that the secreted Env-SU proteins exhibited an inhibitory effect on BLV infection. In conclusion, the engineered BLV Env-SU protein was found to effectively inhibit BLV infection, likely through a mechanism consistent with viral receptor interference and is expected to contribute to the development of infection-prevention methods against BLV.",
    "Antibacterial Efficacy of Non-thermal Atmospheric Pressure Plasma Against Streptococcus Mutans and Lactobacillus Acidophilus of Carious Dentin: A Clinical Study.. Kermanshah H, Karimi M, Motevasselian F, Fathollah S, Bahador A, Kharazifard MJ (2026). BACKGROUND: Dental caries, a multifactorial disease, is primarily driven by acidogenic bacteria such as Streptococcus mutans (S.mutans) and Lactobacillus acidophilus (L.acidophilous). Conventional antimicrobial treatments may be insufficient for complete bacterial eradication. Non-thermal atmospheric pressure plasma (NTAPP) has emerged as a novel antimicrobial strategy. This study aimed to evaluate the antibacterial efficacy of NTAPP on S.mutans and L.acidophilous in carious dentin under clinical conditions. METHODS: A plasma jet device utilizing helium gas (purity 99.999%, nozzle diameter 3 mm, voltage 10 kV, frequency 6 kHz, flow rate 2 L/min) was employed to irradiate the Class I, II, and III cavities in 15 teeth with dentin caries extending no deeper than the middle third of the dentin. Carious dentin was excavated using an excavator immediately before and after plasma treatment. Plasma was applied from a 10 mm distance for one minute. Colony-forming unit (CFU) counts were determined for S. mutans and L. acidophilus. Statistical analysis was conducted using the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test (P value = 0.05). RESULTS: Helium Plasma irradiation resulted in a significant reduction in CFU counts for both S. mutans and L. acidophilus (P < 0.001). The reduction rates were 76.01 ± 25.17% for S. mutans and 76.14 ± 23.88% for L. acidophilus. No significant difference was observed in CFU reduction between the two bacterial species (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Helium-based NTAPP demonstrated a significant antibacterial effect against S. mutans and L. acidophilus in this clinical study, suggesting its potential as an antibacterial treatment for dentin caries lesions.",
    "Strategic engineering of imidazopyridine-benzoxazole hybrids targeting microtubule dynamics: comprehensive inhibition of the metastatic cascade.. Kuzu B, Cakir M, Acikgoz E (2026). A series of twenty novel imidazopyridine-benzoxazole hybrid (Imp1-20) derivatives was designed and synthesized, and their antiproliferative activities were evaluated against MDA-MB-231 breast and DLD-1 colorectal cancer cell lines. Among them, Imp-18 and Imp-20 emerged as the most potent candidates, with low micromolar to nanomolar IC50 values and significant reductions in cancer cell adhesion and colony formation. Flow cytometry analyses demonstrated that both compounds induced apoptosis and promoted cell-cycle arrest, reflected by Sub-G1 accumulation and perturbations in G1/G0 and G2/M phases. Immunofluorescence imaging of β-tubulin confirmed that Imp-18 and Imp-20 compromise microtubule integrity, with Imp-18 displaying stronger tubulin-disrupting activity than nocodazole. The resulting microtubule destabilization was consistent with mitotic arrest and activation of apoptotic signaling pathways. Additionally, both compounds markedly inhibited cancer cell migration, indicating an ability to impair metastatic behavior. Overall, these findings identify Imp-18 and Imp-20 as promising microtubule-targeting agents with robust anticancer potential, providing a strong basis for further mechanistic studies and structural optimization within the framework of medicinal and bioorganic chemistry.",
    "Performance, Skeletal traits, and welfare indicators of four laying hen strains in aviary housing under common management.. Cloft SE, Regmi P, Robison CI, Jones D, Karcher DM (2026). The transition from conventional cages to cage-free aviary systems in egg production presents unique challenges for performance, welfare, and skeletal health of laying hens. While extensive data exists for conventional systems, aviary systems require comprehensive investigation due to larger colony sizes and increased opportunities for vertical and lateral movement. This study evaluated the production, welfare, and skeletal characteristics of four commercial laying hen hybrids, two brown egg (brown) and two white egg (white) strains, in an aviary housing system under common management. Brown strains were consistently heavier with larger tibia volume, surface area, and mineral content compared to white strains. All 4 strains achieved at least 91 % hen day egg production, with white strain C having 8 percentage point higher production rates throughout the majority of lay. Feather coverage deteriorated as all hens aged, but white strains, especially strain C, had more frequent feather damage during assessments. Brown strains had more incidence of keel damage based on manual palpation. However, visual inspection of excised keel bones revealed brown strain B had fewer fractures than all other strains, though 90 % of the keel bones had fractures, frequently in the tip. These findings reveal significant strain-specific differences in production, skeletal health, and welfare in aviary systems. Our use of common management may have hindered hens from achieving their full genetic potential; thus, tailoring management and housing practices to accommodate these differences is crucial for successful cage-free egg production and hen welfare.",
    "Cetylpyridinium chloride inhibits the polarization of tumor-associated macrophages and the proliferation of triple-negative breast cancer cells.. Jiang G, Li C, Jia B, Lu M, Lei Y, Lu K, Cui T, Li H (2026). OBJECTIVES: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer. Due to its radiotherapy resistance, high metastasis rate and recurrence rate, the prognosis is poor. So far, effective therapeutic drugs for it remain elusive. Cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) has initially demonstrated anti-tumor properties in various tumors. Therefore, the aim of this study is to explore the intervention effect of CPC on macrophages in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and its therapeutic effect on TNBC. METHODS: The effects of CPC on macrophage polarization and expression changes were evaluated by WB and RT-qPCR. Multiple TNBC cell lines and non-cancer cells were exposed to CPC under different conditions (concentration and duration), and cell survival and proliferation were assessed by CCK8 and colony formation. The effects of CPC on apoptosis, migration and invasion of TNBC cells were further evaluated. The mitochondrial status was assessed by Mito-Tracker Red CMXRos staining, mitochondrial protein expression detection and ATP content detection to explain the cause of apoptosis. The effect of CPC on TNBC growth was further confirmed in animal models. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that CPC (2 μM) inhibited the M2 polarization of macrophages induced by interleukin-4 (IL-4) and tumor secretions, and reduced their characteristic secretions that promote tumor growth. Meanwhile, CPC significantly suppressed the proliferation of multiple TNBC cell lines, induced mitochondrial damage, significantly decreased cellular ATP levels, and ultimately led to tumor cell apoptosis. Moreover, TNBC cells are more sensitive to CPC than non-tumor cells. Additionally, CPC significantly inhibited the migration and invasion of TNBC cells. Finally, we confirmed the growth inhibitory effect of CPC on TNBC in vivo. CONCLUSION: CPC has dual effects: it inhibits the M2 polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and directly suppresses the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells, ultimately effectively inhibiting the growth of TNBC in vivo. Considering that CPC has been administered in humans as a safe drug-disinfectant for decades, our study here provides a molecular basis for the application of CPC as a potential option to clinical treatments of TNBC.",
    "Quercetagitrin targets EIF3D to activate NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy-dependent ferroptosis for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.. Tang X, Wu F, Rao H, Luo X, Zhang G, Lai X, Li C, Fang J, Li H (2026). BACKGROUND: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the predominant subtype of lung cancer. Although traditional treatment methods such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy can extend patient survival to some extent, they still present significant challenges due to their limited efficacy and substantial side effects. Ferroptosis, a form of iron-dependent programmed cell death, has been shown to exhibit considerable potential in the treatment of NSCLC. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying ferroptosis and how to safely and effectively induce it remain to be fully explored. This study aims to investigate the mechanism by which the natural flavonoid compound Quercetagitrin (Que) regulates the ferritinophagy-ferroptosis pathway to suppress NSCLC and to identify its molecular targets. METHODS: This study evaluated the selective toxicity of Que against NSCLC cells (A549, PC9) and normal lung epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) using in vitro assays, including CCK-8, colony formation, and flow cytometry. Key pathways related to ferritinophagy and ferroptosis were identified through transcriptomic analysis and KEGG pathway analysis. Fluorescence imaging, Western blot (WB) and BODIPY C11 staining were used to assess the levels of ferritinophagy and ferroptosis in cells. Limited proteolysis-mass spectrometry (LiP-MS) and molecular dynamics simulations were employed to identify the direct targets of Que. Gene knockdown and overexpression experiments were conducted to verify that Que targets eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit D (EIF3D) and regulates the activation of nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4) -mediated ferritinophagy. In vivo experiments using xenograft mouse models assessed the antitumor effect and safety of Que. RESULTS: Que selectively inhibited the proliferation and colony formation of NSCLC cells while showing minimal toxicity to normal lung epithelial cells. It promoted the release of Fe²⁺ and lipid peroxidation by activating the NCOA4-dependent ferritinophagy pathway, while simultaneously inhibiting the expression of ferroptosis markers such as glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). LiP-MS and molecular dynamics simulations confirmed EIF3D as a direct target of Que. Knockdown of EIF3D mimicked the antitumor effect of Que, whereas overexpression of EIF3D diminished its antitumor effect. In vivo, Que significantly inhibited tumor growth without observable toxicity, accompanied by upregulation of NCOA4 and LC3 II, and downregulation of EIF3D and GPX4. CONCLUSION: Que exerts significant antitumor effects in NSCLC by targeting EIF3D to activate NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy and ferroptosis. This study reveals a novel mechanism involving the EIF3D-NCOA4 axis in the regulation of ferritinophagy-dependent ferroptosis, providing a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of NSCLC.",
    "The impact of lying down support on the lying down behaviour and piglet trapping in temporarily crated lactating sows.. Sekyrová V, Chaloupková H, Illmann G (2026). The housing of lactating sows remains a persistent animal welfare concern. Temporary crating may offer a compromise that supports the welfare of both sows and piglets in the farrowing pen. This study examined whether sows used lying-down supports (e.g. slope wall) before and after crate opening, and whether such use reduces the risk of piglet crushing. Nineteen healthy sows without any leg problems were housed in temporary farrowing crates from 5 days before farrowing until 3 days postpartum (pp), when crates were opened on the morning of day 4. The pen design included a slope wall angled at 18°, while the other wall, door, and nest barriers could also serve as supports. Sow and piglet behaviours were video-recorded for 24 h at three time points: 24 h before crate opening, 24 h after crate opening, and on day 25 pp. Analysed behaviours included the number and duration of lying-down events, use of supports, sow positions, and piglet positions in the pen and creep area. Continuous variables were analysed using linear mixed models accounting for repeated measures, and binomially distributed variables were evaluated using generalised linear mixed models. Following crate opening, sows significantly reduced their use of all supports compared with both the preopening period and day 25 pp, with nearly 34% of events occurring in the middle of the pen. Use of the slope wall declined significantly immediately after crate opening and decreased further by day 25. Lying-down events lasted longer when supports were used. Trapping events were rare (16 out of 1 539 lying-down events), with fatal crushing occurring in only four cases. These findings indicate that lying-down supports are not essential for preventing piglet crushing once the crate is removed; however, it is important to note that this applies only to healthy sows without mobility problems. Overall, releasing sows from close confinement does not appear to compromise piglet safety and may allow for more natural and maternal behaviours.",
    "A trifluoromethyl quinoline derivative targets SGK1 and modulates the PI3K/AKT pathway to inhibit prostate cancer progression.. Yang X, Wang R, Xu G, Yang Z, Yao X, Liu G, Yu J, Xu B, Luo H, Cao Y (2026). Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most prevalent malignant tumors among men globally, with limited treatment options, especially in cases that progress to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Identifying novel molecular targets and effective therapeutic strategies is crucial for improving patient outcomes. In this study, we identified serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) as a potential target of the trifluoromethylquinoline derivative TKL007. A series of in vitro assays, including CCK-8, colony formation, Transwell migration and invasion assays, and flow cytometry, were performed to systematically evaluate the anti-tumor effects of TKL007 on the PC3 and LNCaP prostate cancer cell lines. Western blot analysis revealed that TKL007 significantly inhibited the activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Further transfection experiments confirmed that SGK1 expression levels regulate the activity of the PI3K/AKT pathway, suggesting that SGK1 may modulate this signaling axis. In vivo xenograft experiments in nude mice demonstrated that TKL007 effectively inhibited tumor growth without causing significant toxicity. Taken together, these results suggest that TKL007 exerts anti-prostate cancer effects by downregulating SGK1 protein levels and inhibiting the PI3K/AKT pathway, providing a new candidate molecule and theoretical foundation for targeted therapy.",
    "Rainfall alters network structure, while fragmentation results in the breakdown of a mixed-species group of birds.. Gómez-Murillo L, Vizentin-Bugoni J, Ramírez-Mejía AF, Tarwater CE (2026). Understanding the influence of species interactions on community structure and biodiversity is a long-standing goal in ecology. While species interactions are predicted to be vulnerable to environmental change, how the environment influences species interactions is not well understood. We used a network analysis approach to examine how network structure and dissimilarity of one type of mixed-species animal group, army ant-following birds, varied along rainfall and habitat suitability (i.e., fragmentation) gradients in Panama. Network structure varied across both gradients and there was high interaction dissimilarity across networks, owing to both species turnover and rewiring. These results highlight the role of the environment in structuring species interactions. Importantly, there was total dissolution of ant-following groups at sites with lower habitat suitability. In drier sites, networks were more speciose, cohesive, and well-connected compared to wetter forests, potentially because of the increased benefits of attending swarms in drier sites. The high cohesion and connections found suggest that ant-following birds may be particularly vulnerable to the loss of important species and environmental change. These ant swarms are an important, shared food resource that draws together a diverse and tightly connected group of birds. Understanding the relationships between the environment and species interactions contributes to our ability to predict how species interactions will change in the future, with cascading effects on community structure and biodiversity.",
    "Liposomes as versatile drug delivery vehicles: emerging trends, technological innovations and future perspectives.. Michael A, Bhattacharya D, Gopal V, Suresh D, Arun J, Ganesh GNK (2026). Liposomes are vesicular carriers and highly engineered multifunctional platforms that can address the broadest range of therapeutic needs. So far, their capacity to encapsulate the hydrophobic and hydrophilic components, as well as their ability to vary their surface chemistry and biocompatibility, has enabled their use on a large scale in oncology, infectious diseases, vaccine delivery, and gene therapy. New developments focus on surface engineering to enhance targeting, stimuli-responsive and intelligent liposome engineering to achieve site-specific drug delivery, and incorporation into hybrid nanocarrier systems that build on and leverage the advantages of multiple delivery platforms. A further expansion in clinical application has been the use of co-delivery and combination therapy approaches, which permit synergistic treatment regimens. Innovations in route-specific delivery, such as inhalable, transdermal, and intranasal liposomal delivery systems or expanded therapeutic delivery and patient adherence. The introduction of individualized and precision liposomal therapy through molecular characterization is a step in the right direction toward individualized treatment regimens. Liposomal medicines have been widely and commercially successful, and liposomal drugs have been approved by the FDA many times (and large-scale production, maximization of stability, regulatory uniformity, and uniform clinical translation are also now no longer problematic). The review provides a combined consideration of the current trend, new technology development, and market awareness with a prospective opportunity description of integrating liposomal delivery with new diagnostic and adaptive therapeutic approaches. Therefore, liposomes will keep leading the pack of forthcoming drug delivery methods as they silence a broader nanotechnology breakthrough through adopting patient-centric approaches.",
    "Elevated emissions of oviposition-induced mango volatiles mediate foraging behavior of a parasitoid wasp, Fopius arisanus.. Wei B, Wei CM, Liu H, Bi TY, Fu Y, Xiao C, Dong WX (2026). BACKGROUND: The parasitoid wasp Fopius arisanus (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) is a solitary egg endoparasitoid of tephritid fruit flies. In this study, we identified the volatile released from the tree-attached mangoes without damage and with oviposition by the oriental fruit fly (Bactrocera dorsalis) in field conditions, and investigated their roles in mediating foraging behavior of this parasitoid species. RESULTS: Ten volatile compounds released by mangoes elicited electrogram responses in antennae or ovipositors of F. arisanus. Among them, α-pinene, d-limonene, β-myrcene, (E)-β-ocimene and ethyl (E)-4-decenoate, individually as well as in a blend attracted female wasps. Likewise, β-myrcene, 3-carene, (E)-β-ocimene, terpinolene and ethyl (E)-4-decenoate, individually, and in a blend attracted male wasps. For female F. arisanus, the blend and ethyl (E)-4-decenoate are primarily detected through their antennae, whereas d-limonene and β-myrcene are mainly perceived via ovipositors. (E)-β-Ocimene appears to be detected by either the antennae or ovipositor, whereas α-pinene is sensed through both organs. Significantly more female individuals landed on the oviposition substrate treated with Blend 3 compared to the paraffin oil control, and the number of wasps exhibiting oviposition behavior was significantly higher in the treatment group during specific time intervals. CONCLUSION: The oviposition-induced blend of mango volatiles [α-pinene, d-limonene, β-myrcene, (E)-β-ocimene and ethyl (E)-4-decenoate] mediates the foraging behavior of female F. arisanus, and serves as a targeted attractant to enhance its field performance against Tephritidae species. © 2026 Society of Chemical Industry.",
    "Gecko protein F2 inhibits tumor angiogenesis by suppressing the VEGF/MAPK/ERK signaling pathway.. Jiang H, Wang H, Wei X, Xie X, Li R, Sun Y, Wang C (2026). The anti-tumor clinical effect of traditional Chinese medicine gecko is very prominent. A novel anti-tumor protein component F2 was isolated and purified from geckos by our group, and the aim of this study was to investigate its antitumor effects in vitro and in vivo and its mechanism of action by inhibiting angiogenesis. The proliferation of cells was determined by colony formation assay and MTT assay. The apoptosis of A549 cells was detected by flow cytometry, and the gene expression changes of cells was analyzed by RNA-seq technology. An H22 tumor-bearing mouse model was prepared, the tumor tissue was analyzed by CD31 immunohistochemical staining. The expression levels of target proteins were detected by Western blot. The proliferation of tumor cells A549 and BEL-7402 was significantly inhibited by F2, but the growth of normal cells L02 was not affected. F2 induces apoptosis in A549 cells and inhibits its migration. RNA-seq results showed that F2 significantly inhibited MAPK signaling pathway in A549 and BEL-7402 cells, and the related genes MEK2 and ERK were significantly down-regulated. The zebrafish thrombus model test showed that the extract of gecko has a significant inhibitory effect on thrombus formation in zebrafish. F2 showed a tumor inhibition rate of 42.24% in mice. A decrease in blood vessels around the tumor and in the tumor tissue was observed. The treatment resulted in a significant down-regulation of VEGF and p-ERK expressions, while a significant up-regulation of p-JNK. In conclusion, F2 has significant antitumor activity. One of its mechanisms of action is to suppress angiogenesis in tumor tissue and surrounding tissues by inhibiting the VEGF/ERK/MAP signaling pathway.",
    "CSF1R inhibitor C19 for glioma immunotherapy enabled by brain-targeting liposomal delivery.. Song WQ, Wu YQ, Zhu QF, Xia XP, Wang R, Yang L, Hu LH, Wang JW, Huang YZ, Wang HY (2026). Immunotherapy targeting tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) has emerged as a promising approach for treating glioma, driven by advances in drug discovery and development, including colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) inhibitors. We previously developed a CSF1R inhibitor, C19, for TAM-targeting immunotherapy, which can reprogram TAMs and remodel the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment. However, the application of CSF1R inhibitors in brain cancer is limited due to inefficient delivery across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). To address this limitation, we designed a brain-targeted liposomal delivery system (T12-Lipo) modified with the transferrin receptor-binding peptide T12. T12-Lipo can specifically bind to transferrin receptors, which are overexpressed in both the BBB and TAMs, thus enhancing the delivery efficiency of C19 across the BBB and to TAMs. This system promoted TAM repolarization toward an anti-tumor M1-like phenotype and thereby facilitated T-cell-mediated tumor killing. T12-Lipo improved the BBB permeability of C19, exhibiting significant therapeutic efficacy against glioma growth. The brain-targeted liposomal formulation of the CSF1R inhibitor C19 represents a promising and effective approach for glioma immunotherapy. T12 peptide-modified liposomes loaded with CSF1R inhibitor C19 can penetrate the BBB, promote M1 phenotypic differentiation of macrophages, effectively activate T-cell immunity, alleviate the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment, and improve the therapeutic efficacy against glioma.",
    "Therapeutic optimization of LIPA targeting to induce endoplasmic reticulum stress and cell death in ovarian cancer.. Viswanadhapalli S, Lee TK, Elmore S, Sharma G, Gopalam R, Panneerdoss DM, Liu X, Parra K, Reese T, Hsieh M, Pratap UP, Yang X, Ebrahimi B, Li X, Neal H, Chen CY, Kassees K, Cervantes C, Baker A, Subbarayalu P, Ramirez P, Lyons YA, Lai Z, Chen Y, Boerma JW, LoCoco PM, Clanton NA, Xu Z, Rao M, Rao TR, Kost E, Sareddy GR, Raj GV, Ahn JM, Vadlamudi RK (2026). Ovarian cancer (OCa) remains the most lethal gynecologic malignancy in the United States, with a five-year survival rate below 20%. Elevated basal levels of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) have recently emerged as a therapeutic vulnerability in OCa. We have previously shown that the tris-benzamide ERX-41 can induce ERS and cancer cell death in OCa by targeting LIPA. In this study, using iterative structure-activity relationship-guided studies to enhance activity in OCa, we identified a more potent ERX-41-derived analog, ERX-208. Importantly, ERX-208 consistently and significantly reduced cell viability in 23 OCa cell lines spanning five major histological OCa subtypes, with IC₅₀ values ranging from 50-100 nM, compared to ∼500 nM for ERX-41. Notably, ERX-208 showed minimal cytotoxicity toward normal ovarian surface epithelial cells, indicating cancer cell selectivity. ERX-208 induced apoptosis and suppressed colony formation in vitro in OCa cells. Mechanistic studies using RNA sequencing, Western blotting, RT-qPCR, transmission electron microscopy, and immunohistochemistry validated robust activation of ERS pathways upon ERX-208 treatment. Through in silico molecular docking simulation and confirmatory detailed site-directed mutagenesis, we identified that ERX-208 binds to LIPA over a broader interaction surface than ERX-41. At the 10 mg/kg dose, ERX-208 demonstrated favorable biodistribution, no observable toxicity, and potent antitumor efficacy in vivo against established cell line-derived xenograft (CDX), patient-derived xenograft (PDX), and patient-derived explant (PDE) models. Immunohistochemical analysis of treated tumors demonstrated changes in expression of proliferative marker (ki67, decreased) and the ERS marker (GRP78, increased). These findings support the clinical advancement of ERX-208 for the treatment of patients with OCa.",
    "Impact of Stem Cell Mobilization with Chemotherapy Versus G-CSF Alone for Multiple Myeloma Patients with Suboptimal Response Before Autologous Stem Cell Transplant.. Chumnumsiriwath P, Bellman P, Tran MH, Golly C, Ciurea SO, Kongtim P (2026). BACKGROUND: Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) remains the standard consolidation therapy for multiple myeloma (MM). Peripheral blood stem cell mobilization, performed using G-CSF alone or in combination with chemotherapy (chemo-mobilization), is a crucial step in this process. Although chemo-mobilization enhances CD34⁺ yields, its effect on disease control and post-transplant outcomes in the era of novel agents remains unclear. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 67 MM patients who underwent ASCT at our institution. Thirty-two patients (47.8%) received chemo-mobilization with cyclophosphamide (37.5%) or KD-PACE plus G-CSF (62.5%) and 35 (52.2%) received G-CSF alone. The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR) at day 90 post-transplant, while transplant outcomes were analyzed as secondary endpoints. Propensity score-adjusted Cox models were used to assess prognostic factors. RESULTS: Chemo-mobilization yielded a higher median CD34⁺ collection (7.9 × 10⁶/kg vs. 6.6 × 10⁶/kg; P = .035), fewer apheresis sessions (P = .005), and reduced plerixafor use (P = .005) compared with G-CSF alone. Among chemo-mobilized patients, 89% showed decreased tumor burden and 21% achieved improved response pre-ASCT. ORR at day 90 post-ASCT was comparable between groups (90.6% vs. 94.3%; P = .569). Complete remission (CR+sCR) and MRD negativity were higher in the G-CSF cohort (65.7% vs. 43.8%, P = .008; 90% vs. 60%, P = .007). At 20-month median follow-up, 3-year PFS was 48.4% versus 89.6% (P = .031); OS did not differ significantly (P = .230). Achieving ≥ VGPR pre-ASCT predicted improved PFS (HR 4.04, 95% CI, 1.04-15.71; P = .044). CONCLUSION: Chemo-mobilization improves stem cell yield and reduces tumor burden without added toxicity. Achieving ≥ VGPR before ASCT was associated with lower relapse risk and superior PFS.",
    "EPICERTIN, an engineered variant of cholera toxin B subunit, promotes survival and a pro-remodeling macrophage phenotype for mucosal healing in colitis.. Verjan Garcia N, Cifuentes JF, Reeves MA, Hwang JY, Park JW, Galandiuk S, Matoba N (2026). EPICERTIN, a modified cholera toxin B subunit (CTB), facilitates mucosal healing in preclinical colitis models, but its anti-inflammatory mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we investigated EPICERTIN's effects on macrophages. In a dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis mouse model, oral administration of EPICERTIN reduced neutrophil infiltration and increased CX3CR1+MHCIIlo/- (M2-like) over CX3CR1+MHCIIhi (M1-like) macrophages in the colon lamina propria. This was concurrent with upregulation of colony-stimulating factor 2 (Csf2) and growth factors (Egf, TgfA, Fgf, Pdgf) involved in mucosal remodeling. Similarly, in colon tissue from a human with active colitis, EPICERTIN significantly upregulated CSF2 and tissue repair-associated genes while downregulating proinflammatory genes (IL1B, IL6ST). In vitro, EPICERTIN promoted macrophage survival under serum-free conditions, whereas CTB induced apoptosis in murine RAW264.7 cells, peritoneal macrophages, and human THP-1 cells. Remarkably, EPICERTIN protected macrophages from apoptosis induced by chemical ER-stressors or lipopolysaccharides. Additionally, EPICERTIN downregulated cell surface molecules HLA-DR, CD14, CD80, and CD86 in THP-1 cells and modestly upregulated chemokines and proinflammatory cytokines genes as well as TGFB1 in human PBMC-derived macrophages. In contrast, CTB strongly increased proinflammatory genes and activation markers. These findings indicate that EPICERTIN promotes macrophage homeostasis by inducing a less inflammatory, pro-remodeling phenotype, whereas CTB may trigger activation-induced cell death.",
    "Metabolome of diapause-destined Megachile rotundata prepupae differs from those undergoing direct development.. Mondal B, Walter RM, Rinehart JP, Yocum GD, Basile F, Greenlee KJ (2026). Diapause in many insects is a non-feeding state, yet energetic demands persist. This imbalance between energy in and energy out can be met by two main mechanisms: reduced metabolism, facilitated by decreasing temperatures, and storage of nutrients. In bivoltine insects, some individuals may continue direct development while others may enter diapause. Few studies have compared these two groups prior to the decision to diapause, even though biochemical differences are likely due to accumulation of nutrient stores and molecules involved in metabolic suppression. In Megachile rotundata, offspring oviposited in early summer develop directly to adults, while those oviposited later that summer enter diapause as prepupae. Here we test the hypothesis that prepupae between the two groups have distinct metabolomic signatures that will indicate key differences in energetic status. We collected 12 non-diapause and 15 diapause-destined nests. Two prepupae from each nest were flash frozen and kept in -80°C until extracted. Diapause state of frozen bees was verified by observing whether nestmates developed or underwent diapause. We used an untargeted GC-MS-based approach that identified 57 significant metabolites with the potential to differentiate between diapause-destined and non-diapause prepupae. Altered metabolites included sugars, polyols, intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and amino acids. Seventeen metabolites (60% carbohydrates) were more abundant in diapause destined prepupae. Forty metabolites (30% amino acids) were more abundant in non-diapausing prepupae. Several metabolites were previously implicated in diapausing insects. Some metabolites, e.g., putrescine, could be used as a biomarker to identify diapause status of nests, benefitting bee growers and farmers.",
    "Symbiotic entrenchment through ecological Catch-22.. Naragon TH, Viliunas JW, Yousefelahiyeh M, Brückner A, Wagner JM, Okamoto KE, Ryon HM, Collinson D, Kitchen SA, Wijker RS, Sessions AL, Parker J (2026). Why symbiotic organisms evolve irreversible dependencies on hosts is an outstanding question. We report a biological stealth device in a beetle that permits infiltration of ant societies. Via transcriptional silencing, the beetle switches off biosynthesis of cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs)-body surface pheromones that function pleiotropically as a waxy desiccation barrier. Silencing transforms the beetle into a chemical blank slate onto which ant CHCs are transferred via grooming behavior, leading to perfect chemical mimicry and acceptance into the colony. Silencing is irreversible, however, forcing the beetle into a chronic dependence on ants to both maintain mimicry and prevent desiccation. We show that evolutionary reversion of the silencing mechanism would render the beetle detectable to ants; conversely, reversion of the beetle's attraction to ants would render it desiccation prone. Symbiotic entrenchment can thus arise from epistasis between symbiotic traits, locking lineages into a Catch-22 that obstructs reversion to living freely.",
    "PARP inhibitor combined with platinum activates the cGAS-STING pathway to enhance anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy in lung adenocarcinoma.. Feng Y, Han Z, Liu X, Yao S, Li Y, Han Y, Xia S (2026). PURPOSE: Despite significant advances in immunotherapy, lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains challenging to treat due to its low immunogenicity. Platinum-based chemotherapy is a well-established DNA-damaging agent. PARP inhibitor is effective for tumors with DNA repair defects while showing limited efficacy in BRCA-proficient non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study investigated whether combining a PARP inhibitor with platinum chemotherapy enhances the response to PD-L1 blockade in LUAD and elucidated the underlying mechanism. METHOD: Immunoblotting, colony formation assays, real-time PCR, immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemistry were employed to investigate the underlying mechanisms in cell lines and the tumor microenvironment. The LLC tumor model was used to assess the efficacy of the combination of PARP inhibitors, platinum, and PD-L1 blockade. Clinical relevance was explored using public databases. RESULTS: PARP inhibitor synergized with platinum to activate the cGAS-STING pathway, leading to an upregulation of PD-L1 expression and stimulation of type I interferon responses in LUAD cells. In LLC mouse models, the triple combination most effectively suppressed tumors, increased dendritic cell and CD8+ T-cell infiltration, thereby augmenting anti-tumor immunity. Clinical data linked high PARP1 expression to MDSC infiltration and poor prognosis, and emerging trial evidence supports this combinatorial strategy. CONCLUSION: The combination of PARP inhibitors and platinum activates the cGAS-STING pathway, leading to increased infiltration of mature DCs and CD8+ T cells, thereby sensitizing NSCLC to anti-PD-L1 therapy. This study presents a promising strategy for treating patients with LUAD with low immunogenicity and poor prognosis.",
    "Proline metabolism supports the hepatocellular carcinoma cell survival by mitigating ROS generation under nutrient starvation.. Mo J, Liu Z, Fu J, Ge Q, Qu Y, Ge N, Liu Y (2026). BACKGROUND: Proline supplementation promotes proliferation and invasion in cancers under acute nutrient deprivation. However, its molecular basis in hepatocellular carcinoma is not fully understood yet. This study investigates how proline metabolism promotes hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell proliferation and survival during nutrient starvation. METHODS: Proline metabolism-related protein expression in HCC versus paracarcinoma tissues was analyzed using The Cancer Genome Atlas database. HCC cell viability was quantified via Cell Counting Kit 8 assays, and colony formation capacity was evaluated. Intracellular ROS levels were measured by flow cytometry. Autophagic flux was assessed by GFP/mCherry fluorescence ratio and autophagy-related proteins by immunoblotting. Lipid droplet deposition was visualized using Hoechst 33342 and BODIPY 493/503 staining. RESULTS: Proline metabolism-related proteins were significantly upregulated in HCC tissues compared to paracarcinoma controls. Under acute nutrient stress, exogenous proline reduced cellular ROS levels, attenuated lipid droplet accumulation, and suppressed excessive autophagy in HCC cells. Proline rescued nutrient deprivation-induced tumor growth inhibition, which could be reversed by H2O2 and rapamycin. CONCLUSION: Proline metabolism sustains HCC cell survival during nutrient restriction by reducing ROS accumulation, thereby inhibiting lipid droplet formation and autophagy.",
    "Exopolysaccharides of Streptococcus mutans Enhance Oral Colonisation and Drug Tolerance in Helicobacter pylori.. Hao Y, Huang Y, Chen R, Li Y, Huang X (2026). INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: The oral cavity is an extragastric reservoir for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), preventing its gastric eradication and causing recurrence. However, the oral environment is not ideal for H. pylori, and the factors facilitating oral H. pylori survival and colonisation are unclear. We explored how exopolysaccharides (EPSs), the fundamental building blocks of Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) biofilms, affect H. pylori colonisation and drug tolerance in the oral cavity. METHODS: The EPS contents of 3 S. mutans biofilms (UA159, UA159ΔgtfB, and UA159ΔgtfBC) were determined via confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). A coculture system of the H. pylori Sydney strain (SS1) and the 3 biofilms was established. The bacterial morphology and adhesive forces of the coculture systems were detected by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), respectively. CLSM observations confirmed the ability of glucosyltransferases (Gtfs) from S. mutans to form EPSs around SS1. The tolerance of SS1 to 2 representative antibiotics in the presence of EPSs was confirmed via colony-forming unit (CFU) counting and in vivo experiments. RESULTS: As the EPS content of the S. mutans biofilms increased, both the adhesive forces between SS1 and the S. mutans biofilms and the number of colonised SS1 cells increased. We extracted active Gtfs from UA159 and confirmed that Gtfs synthesised EPSs around SS1. The EPSs gradually accumulated over time, eventually encapsulating SS1. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed that S. mutans EPSs help protect SS1 against amoxicillin or clarithromycin, potentially confounding gastric lesion outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: S. mutans biofilms mediate the adhesion, colonisation, and antibiotic tolerance of oral H. pylori via Gtf-driven EPS biosynthesis.",
    "Inhibition of fatty acid synthase enhances therapeutic efficacy and delays acquired resistance to BRAF-targeted therapy in colorectal cancer.. Geisen ME, Tessmann JW, Kelson CO, He D, Wang C, Faisal ASM, Beswick EJ, Baca Y, Rock S, Kolesar JM, Zaytseva YY (2026). The presence of BRAFV600E mutations is associated with poor prognosis in colorectal cancer (CRC). Although the FDA-approved combination of encorafenib and cetuximab provides clinical benefit in this population, only 22% of patients respond and most eventually develop resistance. This study investigated the mechanisms of resistance to PLX8394, a second-generation BRAF inhibitor. Using primary and established BRAFV600E CRC cells, we show that the development of resistance to PLX8394 results in cross-resistance of cells to encorafenib. Moreover, the acquired resistance is associated with increased proliferation, invasion, and upregulation of lipid metabolism, including increased expression of fatty acid synthase (FASN), a key enzyme of lipid synthesis. Yet, the combination of PLX8394 and FASN inhibitor TVB3664 has a synergistic effect on cell viability and colony formation in parental CRC cells, but not in PLX-resistant cells. Importantly, we demonstrate that addition of TVB3664 to the PLX8394 or encorafenib regimen significantly postpones development of resistance to BRAF-targeted therapy by inhibiting the cell cycle progression via a decrease in pRb (Ser780) and downregulation of E2F transcription factor and Cyclin D1 expression. Consistently, clinical data show that patients with BRAFV600E CRC who have high FASN expression in tumor tissues have higher expression of cell cycle-associated genes, including CDKs, E2F, CCDN1 (Cyclin D1), survivin, and MKI67. Collectively, these findings identify FASN-driven lipid metabolism as a critical mediator of resistance to BRAF-targeted therapy and suggest that incorporation of FASN inhibitors may enhance therapeutic efficacy and delay acquired resistance in BRAFV600E CRC.",
    "Chronic co-exposure to BPA and alcohol synergizes hepatotoxicity via dysregulation of glycerolipid metabolism and ceramide/HtrA2-driven apoptosis in HepG2 cells.. Tan YQ, Shih CL, Chen YC, Lee SH, Yang JR, Kuo CY, Chiou YS (2026). Bisphenol A (BPA) and alcohol (ALC) are recognized hepatotoxicants to which humans are chronically exposed through environmental sources, dietary habits, and preferences for alcoholic beverages. However, there is currently a lack of conclusive evidence concerning the synergistic hepatotoxic effects associated with co-exposure. This study provides mechanistic insights into BPA and ALC co-exposure-induced subcellular changes mimicking hepatotoxicity using acute and chronic 2D models and 3D HepG2/LX-2 spheroids. Results demonstrated that co-exposure amplified oxidative stress, DNA damage, and apoptosis, while promoting lipid droplet accumulation, thereby manifesting synergistic hepatic lipotoxicity. These findings were corroborated in a physiologically relevant 3D HepG2/LX-2 co-culture spheroid model, where co-exposure induced significantly greater cytotoxicity than single-agent treatments. Mechanistically, chronic co-exposure specifically dysregulated LIPIN-mediated glycerolipid homeostasis by synergistically inducing the expression of LIPIN-2 and LIPIN-3. Furthermore, integrated transcriptomic and lipidomic analyses revealed that the ceramide metabolic pathway is uniquely involved in triggering high-temperature requirement A2 (HtrA2)-mediated apoptosis and oncogenic signaling under conditions of chronic co-exposure to BPA and ALC. Crucially, in vitro oncogenic transformation assays identified the co-exposure as a tumor promoter rather than an initiator, significantly enhancing colony formation following 3-MCA initiation. TIMER database analysis further associated aberrant HTRA2 expression with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development and poor prognosis, which are potentially mediated through downregulation of the detoxification enzyme UDP-glucuronosyltransferase family 2 member B10 (UGT2B10), a factor critical for normal liver cell function. Overall, this study establishes glycerolipid metabolism and HtrA2 as early biomarkers of synergistic hepatic injury and further hepatocarcinogenesis, highlighting critical implications for food safety and risk assessment of chemical-behavioral co-exposures.",
    "From Fear to Feast: Rattlesnakes Navigate the Landscape of Fear to Optimize Foraging.. Da Cunha O, Dominguez RP, Horne LM, Mead JJ, Fournier C, Johnson JD, Seymoure BM (2026). AbstractAccording to optimal foraging theory, mesopredators should forage in areas where their prey is abundant while avoiding high predation risk. Here, we investigate how environmental factors influence mesopredators' abilities to minimize spatiotemporal overlap with predators while increasing spatiotemporal overlap with prey. We paired 30 western diamond-backed rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox) 3D printed replicas with game cameras in West Texas for 2 years to quantify several spatiotemporal factors affecting prey availability and predation risk. Concurrently, 25 C. atrox were radiotracked at the same site to gather activity and microhabitat selection data regarding free-ranging individuals. Random forest algorithms were trained using data obtained from the game camera and applied to predict the probability of predation and the probability of prey encounter for each radiotracking event. Time of day, month, vegetation structure, and concealment percentage all had a significant association with the probability of predation and the probability of prey encounter. Our results suggest that rattlesnakes choose to be active when and where the probability of prey encounter was significantly higher than the probability of predator encounter, thus following optimal foraging theory. Our results demonstrate that mesopredators increase chances of prey capture while reducing predator detection in natural settings.",
    "Bird-Scented Nests as a Mechanism for Olfactory Homing in a Burrow-Nesting Seabird.. Jennings SL, Patricelli GL, Ebeler SE (2026). AbstractNavigation to and from a familiar site is a common animal behavior called homing. Many species use olfactory environmental landmarks or scents deposited in the environment by themselves or their conspecifics for homing. Birds regularly commute to and from their nest, and olfaction, an underappreciated sense in birds, may facilitate this behavior. Burrow-nesting seabirds, for example, rely on olfaction to locate their breeding colony and to identify their burrow, but the specific chemical information they use is unclear. We examined the chemical profiles of the colony landscape and its avian occupants at a breeding island of Leach's storm petrels (Hydrobates leucorhous) to determine whether place-specific chemicals, bird-produced chemicals, or both enable homeward navigation in this burrow-nesting species. We found that the colony contains spatial gradients of chemicals that may facilitate multiple stages of homing. We also show that burrows possess unique odors owing to chemicals deposited by their occupants. Moreover, the burrow shapes the odor of the birds such that individuals carry the scent of their nest and mated pairs possess similar chemical profiles. The bidirectional transfer of compounds between burrows and birds may enable burrow recognition in this species and potentially functions as a means of communication between conspecifics.",
    "Evaluating a Wearable-Based Pain Monitoring System in Palliative Cancer Care: Usability and Feasibility Study.. Domínguez F, Heras J, Benjumea J, Vallejo M, Parra E, Fiallos W, Villao A, Pazmiño F, Stiens J, da Silva B (2026). BACKGROUND: Effective pain management is a cornerstone of cancer palliative care, yet it remains challenging in low- and middle-income countries due to limited resources, regulatory constraints, and a lack of objective tools. While wearable technologies offer promise for augmenting pain-related patient-reported outcomes with physiological data, their usability in palliative settings in low- and middle-income countries is underexplored. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the technology usability and implementation feasibility of the NEST (Non-intrusive Devices for Telemedicine) system, a low-cost, smartwatch-based pain monitoring solution for palliative cancer care co-designed with health care staff from a cancer hospital in Ecuador. METHODS: An observational usability study was conducted with 7 patients with cancer receiving palliative care treatment, combining hospital- and home-based monitoring phases. We used a qualitative and quantitative approach to assess the usability of the NEST system and to identify sociotechnical factors affecting feasibility using the NASSS (Nonadoption, Abandonment, Scale-up, Spread, and Sustainability) framework. RESULTS: Quantitative results showed a strong preference for the smartwatch over the mobile phone for submitting patient-reported outcomes (246/296, 83%), with wear-time adherence of the smartwatch ranging from 36% to 92% of the time. Qualitative feedback from patients and health care staff indicated good usability and perceived clinical value, though technical and organizational challenges, such as charging habits, training needs, and dashboard integration into the daily workflow of health care staff, were noted. As for feasibility, most of the complexity was found in the dynamics of the health condition, while the technology shows clear promising signs of having value to patients and health care staff. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the commonly reported usability hurdles of a smartwatch-based sociotechnical health solution are surmountable given fluid communication between stakeholders during all stages of design and deployment. The primary threats to feasibility in our context seem to lie in the highly complex and dynamic environment of palliative cancer care, regulatory ambiguity regarding the use of medical devices, and the workload burden on health care staff.",
    "Development of niosomal nanoparticles loaded with cisplatin and vorinostat combination for cancer therapy.. Ali H, Lafi Z, Shalan N (2026). Cisplatin (CIS) remains a cornerstone of chemotherapy but is limited by resistance and systemic toxicity. Combining DNA-damaging agents with epigenetic modulators such as vorinostat (VOR) offers a promising strategy to enhance efficacy. However, the co-delivery of these drugs is challenging due to their distinct physicochemical properties. The aim was to develop and characterize niosomal nanoparticles co-loaded with CIS and VOR (NIO-CIS-VOR) and to assess their physicochemical characteristics and in vitro anticancer activity. Niosomes were prepared using ethanol injection, with CIS entrapped in the aqueous core and VOR in the lipid bilayer. Characterization included particle size, polydispersity index (PDI), and zeta potential by DLS, morphology by TEM, and encapsulation confirmation by FTIR. Encapsulation efficiency (EE%) and drug release were determined by HPLC. Cytotoxicity, caspase-3/7 activation, colony formation, and wound healing assays were conducted in HT-29, A549, and PANC-1 cancer cell lines. Optimized NIO-CIS-VOR nanoparticles exhibited a mean diameter of 152.7 nm, PDI of 0.12, and zeta potential of -9.79 mV, with spherical morphology. Encapsulation efficiency of NIO-CIS-VOR reached 89.3% for CIS and 52.1% for VOR. The formulation showed sustained release over 72 h, with cumulative release of 62% (CIS) and 38% (VOR) at 6 h. Cytotoxicity assays demonstrated markedly reduced IC50 values for NIO-CIS-VOR compared with free drugs: 1.8 µM vs. 4.47 µM (CIS) and 3.4 µM (VOR) in HT-29; 0.95 µM vs. 3.8 µM and 3.1 µM in A549; and 2.37 µM vs. 13.9 µM and 3.66 µM in PANC-1. Enhanced apoptosis and reduced colony formation further confirmed superior anticancer activity.In Conclusion the Co-loaded niosomes achieved efficient co-delivery, sustained release, and synergistic anticancer effects, highlighting NIO-CIS-VOR as a promising nanocarrier for combination cancer therapy.",
    "Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis developing during tofacitinib treatment for anti-MDA5 antibody-positive dermatomyositis-associated interstitial lung disease: a case report and review of the literature.. Fujita S, Nishimura H, Nakano K (2026). Anti-melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) antibody-positive dermatomyositis (DM)-associated interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a rapidly progressive and life-threatening condition that often requires aggressive immunosuppressive therapy, including Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, whose safety profile remains incompletely understood. We report an extremely rare case of secondary pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) that developed during tofacitinib treatment for multidrug-refractory anti-MDA5 antibody-positive DM-associated ILD. A 74-year-old Japanese woman with rapidly progressive DM-associated ILD was treated with high-dose glucocorticoids, intravenous cyclophosphamide, and cyclosporine, followed by tofacitinib due to an insufficient response. Although the ILD initially improved, she later developed progressive elevation of serum KL-6 levels and diffuse ground-glass opacities on chest computed tomography despite only mild respiratory symptoms. Transbronchial lung biopsy revealed periodic acid-Schiff-positive material within the alveolar spaces, and serum anti-granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor antibodies were negative, leading to a diagnosis of secondary PAP. Discontinuation of tofacitinib alone resulted in rapid clinical and radiological improvement. This case highlights PAP as a rare, potentially reversible complication during JAK inhibitor therapy in anti-MDA5 antibody-positive DM-associated ILD and underscores the importance of considering PAP when elevated KL-6 levels and radiological abnormalities occur despite only mild respiratory symptoms.",
    "Harnessing semiochemicals for parasitoid-based biological control: from laboratory identification to field applications.. Guo H, Wang CZ (2025). Parasitoids are vital biological control agents in agricultural pest management, with mating and parasitism as their core behaviors essential for reproduction and survival. In recent decades, advanced analytical techniques, such as gas chromatography-electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD), have enabled the identification of key semiochemicals that regulate parasitoid behavior. Notably, studies on Campoletis chlorideae (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae) have elucidated the mechanisms of sex pheromone communication, advancing our understanding of pheromonal signaling in parasitoids. Moreover, plant-derived synomones and host-derived kairomones serve as pivotal chemical cues for host location, underpinning tritrophic (plant-pest-parasitoid) interactions. The functional characterization of olfactory receptors tuned to herbivore-induced plant volatiles and kairomones, achieved through ectopic expression systems, has further clarified the molecular mechanism underlying semiochemical-mediated behaviors. Synthetic biology offers promising avenues for manipulating parasitoid behavior by leveraging genetic and metabolic engineering of plants and yeast to release critical synomones and kairomones, thereby improving parasitoid recruitment. This review synthesizes the role of semiochemicals in mediating parasitoid behaviors, evaluates methodologies for behavioral manipulation, and explores the potential and limitations of integrating synthetic biology with semiochemicals to advance sustainable pest management.",
    "Thermal tolerance and heritability in dune-dwelling ants reveal bioindicator potential for climate vulnerability in coastal ecosystems.. da Conceição KV, Cristiano MP, Cardoso DC (2026). Climate change is expected to intensify thermal stress in coastal ecosystems, threatening biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. In this study, we investigate species-specific and colony-level variation in thermal tolerance among three psammophilous ant species (Mycetophylax spp.) inhabiting Brazilian coastal dunes. Using critical thermal limits (CTmin and CTmax), linear mixed-effects models, and heritability estimates, we assessed the role of diel activity rhythms and genetic structure in shaping thermal performance. Results revealed that M. simplex, a nocturnal and substrate-specialized species, exhibited significantly lower CTmin and CTmax values compared to diurnal congeners, and that colony identity explained a substantial portion of variance (H² = 0.53 for CTmin, H² = 0.39 for CTmax). These findings suggest limited thermal resilience and evolutionary constraints in M. simplex, reinforcing its potential as a bioindicator of thermal vulnerability. Given projected warming and habitat disturbance in southeastern Brazil, we highlight the importance of integrating functional traits and genetic metrics into environmental monitoring and conservation planning.",
    "TMEM205 promotes M2-like macrophage polarization and advances the progression of triple-negative breast cancer.. Zhang Y, Peng J, Ma T, Liu X, Liu J, Zhou Q, Wang H (2026). INTRODUCTION: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive subtype and lacks effective targeted therapies. Transmembrane protein 205 (TMEM205) has been implicated in tumor progression and immune resistance, but its precise role and mechanism in TNBC remain unclear. This study aims to explore the function and mechanism of TMEM205 in TNBC progression, as well as its impact on the tumor immune microenvironment. METHODS: The expression and prognostic significance of TMEM205 in breast cancer were analyzed using datasets, such as TCGA and UALCAN. TMEM205 was overexpressed and knocked down in TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and BT-549), and the effects on cell biological activity were verified by functional assays, including CCK-8, colony formation, wound healing, and Transwell assays. A coculture system of tumor cells and THP-1-derived macrophages was established. Key signaling molecules of TNBC cells were detected by Western blot, and cytokine levels by ELISA, so as to study tumor cell-macrophage interactions. The role of TMEM205 in tumor growth and angiogenesis was further validated through xenograft mouse models and endothelial tube formation assays. RESULTS: TMEM205 was significantly upregulated in breast cancer tissues and associated with a poor prognosis. TMEM205 overexpression promoted the proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of TNBC cells, while TMEM205 knockdown inhibited their biological functions. Furthermore, TMEM205 overexpression not only increased the secretion of IL-6 but also activated the JAK2/STAT3 signaling axis, showing a positive correlation with M2 macrophage infiltration. The TNBC cell-conditioned medium with TMEM205 overexpression significantly promoted endothelial cell angiogenesis. CONCLUSION: TMEM205, as a multifunctional oncoprotein in TNBC, jointly drives tumor progression by promoting cell proliferation, metastasis, angiogenesis, and fostering an immunosuppressive microenvironment via M2 macrophage polarization. TMEM205 may be a promising therapeutic target for TNBC.",
    "Strawberry Notch 1 Acts as a Transcriptional Regulator Driving Oncogenic Programs in Liver Carcinogenesis.. Fritzsche S, Sugiyanto RN, Gür K, Krumme A, Marois ML, Fraas A, Inal A, Huerta M, Henriques V, Eiteneuer E, Albrecht T, Charbel A, Dill MT, Sticht C, De La Torre C, Pusch S, Mehrabi A, Breuhahn K, Ji J, Schirmacher P, Goeppert B, Roessler S (2026). Aberrant Notch signaling has been identified as a key driver of cancer development. Genetic studies in Drosophila showed that the knockout of strawberry notch (sno) mimics the loss of notch. Here, we found that Strawberry Notch 1 (SBNO1) is upregulated in several cancer entities and elucidated the role of SBNO1 in liver cancer development. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), SBNO1 protein was significantly increased and localized to the nucleus suggesting its involvement in gene regulation. SBNO1-inhibition reduced cell viability, colony formation and migration and induced distinct expression patterns in HCC and CCA cell lines. However, BioID revealed that SBNO1 similarly modulates gene regulation in HCC and CCA by binding to general transcription factors TAF4 and TAF3. Deletion of Sbno1 in murine liver cancer cells Hep55.1C reduced tumor growth in vivo. In addition, inhibition of Sbno1 significantly reduced liver tumor development in three different mouse models of HCC and CCA. Furthermore, Sbno1-deletion reduced biliary differentiation and angiogenesis in the tumor margin, underscoring the necessity of Sbno1 in Notch-driven CCA formation. Thus, we identified SBNO1 as a transcriptional regulator required for liver cancer development and progression.",
    "A bird nest-inspired and fully biomass coating with an interpenetrating fibrous network for thermal insulation and universal fire retardancy.. Gou X, Wang T, Liang YQ, Luo J, Xu C, Deng J, Fu ZC, An W, Chen MJ (2026). Flame-retardant coatings provide effective fire protection for various substrates, yet developing eco-friendly alternatives that combine strong adhesion, high-efficiency flame retardancy, and excellent thermal insulation remains a formidable challenge. Inspired by the nesting behavior of birds, a fully biomass-based fire-retardant coating without traditional flame-retardant elements was constructed through a green multiple-groups synergy strategy for \"one stone for multiple birds\" that concurrently incorporates nanostructuring, strong adhesion, thermal insulation, and universal flame retardancy. In this design, gallic acid (GA) self-assembles into nanofibrous-like supramolecular aggregates through π-π stacking, mimicking structural \"twigs\". Meanwhile, chitosan acts as a cohesive binder, replicating the adhesive function of \"saliva\". The resulting coating exhibits a bird nest-like interpenetrating structure with nanopores (<250 nm), which reduces the thermal conductivity of rigid polyurethane foam (RPUF) to 24.85 mW (m K)-1 from 28.57 mW (m K)-1. The synergy of decarboxylation/carbonization and radical scavenging imparts self-intumescent barrier properties and universal flame retardancy to diverse materials (fabric, RPUF, paper, wood), yielding a limiting oxygen index of 25-30%, and smoke and toxic gas suppression. This work presents a biomimetic strategy for sustainable, high-performance flame-retardant coatings with broad applicability.",
    "The Oncogenic Role of Serum Marker GDF15 in Promoting Colorectal Tumorigenesis via EMT and Stemness.. Xu H, Zhang Q, Li Q, Gu F, Wang D, Tian Y, Khatra H (2026). BACKGROUND: Growth Differentiation Factor 15 (GDF15), a stress-responsive cytokine, is involved in the progression of various cancers. However, its precise functional role and underlying mechanism in colorectal cancer (CRC) remain unclear. METHODS: GDF15 expression in CRC was analyzed using public databases and validated in patient tissues by Western blot. Functional assays, including colony formation, CCK-8, wound-healing, and Transwell, were performed on LOVO and HCT116 cells following GDF15 overexpression or knockdown to assess proliferation, migration, and invasion. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stemness markers were examined by Western blot. Cancer stem cell properties were evaluated using a tumorsphere formation assay. RESULTS: GDF15 was significantly upregulated in CRC tissues at both mRNA and protein levels. In vitro, GDF15 overexpression in LOVO cells promoted proliferation, migration, and invasion and induced EMT, as evidenced by downregulated E-cadherin and upregulated vimentin and N-cadherin. Conversely, GDF15 knockdown in HCT116 cells produced opposite effects. Furthermore, GDF15 enhanced CRC cell stemness, increasing tumorsphere formation and upregulating stemness markers (CD133, SALL4, OCT4, NANOG). Clinically, high serum GDF15 levels were significantly associated with advanced age, late TNM stage, and elevated CEA, indicating its correlation with aggressive disease features. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that GDF15 acts as a tumor promoter in CRC by driving EMT, facilitating proliferation and metastasis, and enhancing cancer stemness. This study identifies GDF15 as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for CRC.",
    "Lightweight Adaptive and Recoverable Implants (LARI) for Chronic Single and Dual Neuropixels 2.0 Recordings for Naturalistic Behaviors in Feature-Rich Environments.. Singh MR, Gregg C (2026). Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying naturalistic decision-making requires chronic, high-quality neural recordings from distributed brain regions in freely behaving animals. However, existing silicon probe implants for mice are limited by weight, fragility, lack of independent probe adjustment, and poor suitability for long-term recordings in complex environments. Here we introduce LARI-1.0 (Lightweight Adjustable and Reusable Implant) and LARI-mini, two Neuropixels 2.0 implant systems designed for stable, recoverable, and independently adjustable single- and dual-probe recordings in mice. LARI-1.0 enables independent vertical and lateral positioning of two probes, while LARI-mini provides a lighter single-probe alternative, reducing implant mass by ~20%. Fully assembled weights of ~2.3 g (LARI-1.0) and ~1.5 g (LARI-mini) remain within 10% and 7.5% of adult male mouse body weight, respectively. We validated implant performance in a custom feature-rich naturalistic foraging environment that elicited full-body movements, rapid elevation changes, and ethological foraging behaviors across fed, fasted, and high-fat diet states. Both implants exhibited excellent mechanical stability, minimal motion-related artifacts, and probe drift comparable to previous studies. High-quality single-unit activity with stable waveform features, 5-6× signal-to-noise ratios, and no systematic loss of well-isolated units was maintained for up to 180 days. These results demonstrate that LARI-1.0 and LARI-mini provide lightweight, durable, and customizable implant solutions enabling long-term, high-fidelity neural recordings during naturalistic behavior.",
    "A Sensitized ENU Mutagenesis Screen for Thrombosis Modifiers Identifies Suppressor Variants in Non-mutagenized Parental Generations Due to Antithrombotic Selective Pressures.. Brake MA, Cleuren AC, Torres S, van der Ent MA, Zhu G, Kulchycki J, Parsons TM, Schneider CD, Jurek AM, MacFadyen K, Siebert AE, Siemieniak DR, Timms AE, Beier DR, Westrick RJ (2026). Thrombosis is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. We used a mouse forward genetic ENU screen to identify genomic variants that suppress F5 L/L Tfpi +/- lethal thrombosis. Surviving F5 L/L Tfpi +/- mice from our M odifier of F actor 5 L eiden 16 ( MF5L16 ) ENU line were subjected to whole-genome sequencing analysis. This revealed that instead of an ENU-induced mutation, four mutations introduced from our F5 L/L breeding stock were responsible for survival, which we named sMF5L1-4 for s pontaneous M odifier of F actor 5 L eiden. In our colony, F5 L/L female breeders carrying all four sMF5L mutations produced more litters and offspring than breeders with three or fewer mutations (p<0.006). Genotyping of 13 additional MF5L lines demonstrated that the four sMF5L mutations were present in all lines and were consistently associated with survival. Of these four mutations, a single G to A intergenic variant on Chromosome 18 (Chr18 A , sMF5L4 ), was most significantly associated with survival (p=0.003), with ∼15% penetrance for conferring the survival phenotype. Furthermore, platelet aggregation was significantly reduced in Chr18 A mice, suggesting an additional mechanism by which Chr18 A could suppress lethal thrombosis. Comparative transcriptomics analysis of livers from Chr18 A mice versus wildtype littermate controls revealed a small number of differentially expressed genes both known and unknown to affect thrombosis. In summary, we have identified four variants exerting a significant selective breeding advantage along with antithrombotic effects. Superimposing our mutagenesis screen on a selective background illustrates the interplay of natural strain background variants and de novo ENU mutations in suppressing F5 L/L Tfpi +/- lethal thrombosis.",
    "Temporal synchrony between human odor rhythms and mosquito olfactory preference shapes host attraction.. Lou L, Chandrasegaran K, Devilliers J, Compton A, Kobiowu A, Applebach E, Bisese A, Rust R, Diggs S, Luff S, Sapkota S, Wynne NE, Eilerts DF, Evans O, Benoit JB, Tu ZJ, Lahondère C, Vinauger C (2026). For anthropophilic mosquitoes such as Aedes aegypti , aligning host-seeking with human availability enhances foraging efficiency and reproductive success. Although time of day modulates mosquito activity and olfactory sensitivity, it remains unknown whether human hosts display rhythmic changes in odor cues and whether mosquitoes adjust their sensory responses accordingly. Here, we combine chemical, behavioral, genetic, and transcriptomic approaches to reveal that both mosquitoes and their human hosts in this interaction are temporally synchronized. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry showed systematic daily shifts in human body odor composition between morning and evening. Correspondingly, mosquitoes prefer host odors that match their own active phase-a time-specific preference abolished in timeless mutants and under constant darkness. Silencing the timeless gene further induced an aversion for the host scent under light-dark conditions. Transcriptomic analysis of mosquito heads and antennae uncovered rhythmic expression of sensory and neuromodulatory genes, driven by both circadian and light-dark cycles and which peaks during mosquitoes' active periods, with rhythmic co-expression networks collapsing in timeless knockouts. Together, these results show that mosquito attraction to humans is temporally tuned by the interplay of host odor rhythms and mosquito sensory rhythms, revealing a previously unrecognized form of interspecific temporal synchronization in vector-host interactions.",
    "Exploring the GM-CSF Histidine Triad as a Modulator of Structure, Molecular Motion, and Ligand Binding.. Cui JY, Varghese I, Bock AS, Floody M, Zhang F, Rubenstein BM, Lisi GP (2026). Granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a cytokine that plays a role in immune modulation. Its expression is associated with a multitude of different effects ranging from harmful, as in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis, to beneficial, as in the case of mitigation of diabetes type I and neutropenia. However, there is a large gap in knowledge explaining how GM-CSF toggles its structure for such physiological and pathological interactions. Our work describes an ongoing attempt to address this gap by focusing on a clustered histidine triad within alpha-helices near the N-terminus, which prior studies have suggested play a role in binding ligands at an acidic pH. While GM-CSF is known to be highly flexible at a more acidic pH, several properties of its histidine triad remain unclear at the physiological pH at which GM-CSF would encounter its binding partners. We describe an effort to characterize the role of the GM-CSF histidines under physiological pH, specifically to determine if these histidines are key to GM-CSF structural integrity, and whether individual histidine residues modulate binding as they do at a lower pH. Our findings reveal that, while the histidine residues have an impact on GM-CSF structure, flexibility, and stability, they alone do not modulate the affinity for ligands at neutral pH. These data provide an initial explanation for the pleiotropic functions and interactions of GM-CSF within a biophysical context.",
    "Microglial epigenetic memory is associated with accelerated resolution of inflammatory pain induced by prophylactic macrophage-derived small extracellular vesicles.. Luo X, Wickman JR, DaCunza JT, Tian Y, Sacan A, Ajit SK (2026). Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) including exosomes play an important role in intercellular communication and can exert immunomodulatory effects in recipient cells. We have shown that a single prophylactic intrathecal injection of sEVs from RAW 264.7 macrophages two weeks prior, promotes faster resolution of mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity in the complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) mouse model of inflammatory pain. How this long-term memory develops, and how sEVs regulate immune responses are unknown. Recent studies have shown that priming microglia with inflammatory stimuli can enhance or suppress responses to a delayed secondary insult via epigenetic modifications. We hypothesized that prophylactic intrathecal administration of macrophage-derived sEVs confers accelerated resolution of inflammatory pain by reprogramming epigenetic memory in spinal microglia in recipient CFA model mice. To determine whether prophylactic sEVs could attenuate pain in the absence of microglia when administering sEVs, we ablated microglia using a colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) inhibitor, PLX5622. sEV-induced pain prophylaxis was completely abolished in PLX5622-fed mice, indicating that microglia are required to be present during sEV administration to confer early resolution of inflammatory pain hypersensitivity. ChIP-seq analysis in spinal microglia 14 days after sEV administration (prior to CFA) revealed an increased number of gene loci enriched for H3K4me1, a hallmark of innate immune memory. Furthermore, inhibiting the H3K4 mono-methyltransferase SETD7 abolished sEV-induced pain attenuation. Our findings indicate that both microglia and its epigenetic reprogramming contribute to pain prophylaxis induced by macrophage-derived sEVs, providing novel insights into the development of non-addictive preventive analgesia.",
    "Extracellular vesicles facilitate the horizontal transfer of drug resistance and stem-like properties between ovarian tumor cells.. Pooladanda V, Xu R, Zarrella DT, Matoba Y, Shimada C, Kumar S, Kim E, Dibenedetto P, Qin X, Sarosiek KA, Krueger M, Magrassi N, Amiji M, Mohammadabadi MA, Winter U, Castro CM, Im H, Kumar R, Wang C, Dahl KDC, Nephew KP, Yeku OO, Milane LS, Rueda BR (2026). Ovarian cancer stem cells (CSCs) can seed recurrent drug-resistant disease. Likewise, non-CSCs can acquire CSC phenotypic properties. How this process is orchestrated is of interest to inform how it might be prevented. We tested the hypothesis that ovarian CSC and/or drug-resistant tumor cells confer stem-like properties via extracellular vesicles (EVs). We focused our investigation on how EVs might mediate EZH2 signaling to promote a phenotypic change in drug-sensitive, non-CSCs. To accomplish this, we utilized paired PARP inhibitor-sensitive and - resistant ovarian cancer (OvCa) cell lines, EZH2 knockdown lines, and patient-derived organoids (PDOs) originating from recurrent high-grade serous OvCa. Small EVs isolated from drug-sensitive, CSC and/or drug-resistant enriched cultures, PARP inhibitor (olaparib) resistant lines, or drug-treated (olaparib or carboplatin) lines were cultured with treatment naïve or sensitive lines for defined time points. The impact of small EV exposure was determined by assessing cell number, metabolic activity, viability, sphere and colony-forming capacity, ALDH activity, DNA damage, and changes in associated signaling pathways. We found that EVs from CSC or drug-resistant enriched cell fractions communicate CSC-like phenotypes to the more sensitive tumor cells via EZH2 canonical and non-canonical signaling pathways, promoting stemness. We conclude that EV-mediated activation of EZH2 signaling represents a targetable mechanism contributing to stemness-associated drug resistance in OvCa.",
    "Microbiota-Based Interventions Differentially Rescue Gut and Social Behavior Phenotypes in a Drosophila Autism-like Model.. Peta Martinez NA, Reinoso Arnaldi M, Santiago-Rodriguez TM, Rodriguez-Fernandez IA (2026). INTRODUCTION: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a lifelong neurological and developmental disorder that has no cure and is often accompanied by gastrointestinal (GI) issues. The bidirectional communication system known as the gut microbiota-brain axis may help explain how GI dysfunction contributes to neurological symptoms. Loss-of-function mutations in the histone demethylases KDM5A , KDM5B or KDM5C are found in patients with intellectual disability and ASD. Previous studies using a Drosophila Kdm5 loss-of-function ( Kdm5 LOF ) ASD-like model revealed gut microbial dysbiosis, reduced abundance of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum , and impaired social behavior. While L. plantarum supplementation rescued intestinal abnormalities, it did not restore social behavior. METHODS: Here, we evaluated multiple microbiota-based interventions, including probiotic supplementation with Lactiplantibacillus plantarum , Lactobacillus helveticus , their combination, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), to determine their capacity to modulate gut microbial composition and behavior in Kdm5 LOF flies. Gut bacterial abundance was quantified using colony-forming unit (CFU) assays and full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Social behavior was assessed using the social distance assay, while anxiety-like behavior and locomotion were evaluated using the open field test. Gut-specific Kdm5 knockdown was used to assess tissue-specific contributions to microbiota and behavioral phenotypes. RESULTS: Kdm5 deficiency resulted in reduced abundance of culturable Lactobacillus , Acetobacter , and Enterobacter species, accompanied by impaired social behavior. L. plantarum supplementation restored gut microbial abundance in both whole-body Kdm5 LOF and gut-specific Kdm5 knockdown models but did not significantly rescue social behavior. In contrast, L. helveticus significantly improved social interaction in Kdm5 LOF flies despite minimal effects on gut bacterial abundance, revealing a dissociation between microbial restoration and behavioral outcomes. Gut-specific Kdm5 knockdown phenocopied both microbial and social defects observed in Kdm5 LOF mutants. Notably, FMT from healthy donors partially restored Lactobacillus abundance, reshaped gut microbial community structure, and partially improved social behavior in Kdm5 LOF recipient flies. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these findings identify Kdm5 as a key regulator of gut microbial viability and social behavior and demonstrate that microbiota-based interventions exert strain- and phenotype-specific effects. Our results reveal that restoration of microbial abundance alone is insufficient to rescue social behavior and highlight the importance of functional host-microbe interactions in gut-brain communication. This work establishes Drosophila as a tractable platform for dissecting epigenetic regulation of microbiota-behavior relationships relevant to ASD and for evaluating targeted probiotic and microbiota-transfer strategies.",
    "CSF1R-related leukoencephalopathy presenting with early apathy, hypoactivity, and cognitive flattening: a case report of a diagnostic challenge.. Yang W, Li C, Zhang H, Zhang Y (2026). Hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids (HDLS) is a rare autosomal dominant leukodystrophy primarily caused by mutations in the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) gene, characterized by progressive cognitive and motor decline. We present a case of a 42-year-old Chinese woman with a rapidly progressive syndrome featuring prominent apathy, cognitive impairment, and hypoactivity. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed extensive confluent white matter hyperintensities (Fazekas grade 3) predominantly in frontal and parietal lobes, cerebral atrophy, and thinning of the corpus callosum. Comprehensive genetic testing identified a heterozygous missense mutation in the CSF1R gene (c.2342C > T, p.Ala781Val), located within the tyrosine kinase domain, confirming the Diagnosis of HDLS. This case highlights early apathy and hypoactivity as red-flag manifestations of CSF1R-related leukoencephalopathy in a 42-year-old woman with rapidly progressive cognitive decline. The atypical presentation, initially mimicking psychiatric or demyelinating disease, underscores the need to consider CSF1R sequencing when encountering early-onset cognitive or behavioral deterioration with unexplained white-matter changes, thereby facilitating timely diagnosis and genetic counseling.",
    "Elective flexible ureteroscopy with suction sheaths for infectious stones in prior UTI patients.. Cormio A, Castellani D, Yuen SKK, Fong KY, Ragoori D, Dragos L, Omar M, Cormio L, Zeng G, Zhu W, Liu S, Herrmann TRW, Somani BK, Ng CF, Elshazly M, Gauhar V (2026). OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the safety, efficacy and clinical outcomes of elective flexible ureteroscopy using flexible and navigable suction ureteral access sheaths (FANS) in patients with upper tract infectious stones following initial management of systemic urinary tract infections (UTIs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a multicentre prospective analysis of patients with infectious ureteral or kidney stones (struvite or calcium carbonate-apatite) who underwent flexible ureteroscopy using FANS between March 2024 and March 2025. All patients had prior systemic UTI management with a minimum 6-week interval before definitive stone treatment. Stone-free rate was assessed at 30 days using a CT scan. RESULTS: The cohort included 144 patients (median age 51 years, 70.1% female) with a median stone diameter of 1.9 cm. 20.1% had initially received only antibiotic treatment, whereas 79.9% had also received emergency drainage. Forty-seven patients (32.6%) had emphysematous pyelonephritis at initial presentation. Median operative time was 40 min with a 1-day hospital stay. Notable findings included zero cases of sepsis and a 29.9% rate of postoperative fever requiring extended antibiotics up to 2 weeks. Zero residual fragments were achieved in 48.6% and a single fragment up to 2 mm in 43.8% of patients (92.4% combined stone-free rate). Renal function improved at 30 days (median creatinine decrease -15 μmol/L) and 3 months (-18 μmol/L). Fever rate was 29.8% in the emphysematous pyelonephritis subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: Elective flexible ureteroscopy using FANS for upper tract infectious stones is feasible for its excellent safety profile with no sepsis cases and high stone-free rates. FANS technology appears to offer significant advantages in this challenging patient population by mitigating postoperative sepsis due to debris aspiration, reduction of pyelovenous backflow of contaminated irrigation fluids and improved stone fragment evacuation.",
    "Hatching Success of Olive Ridley Sea Turtles in Semi-Natural Nests: A Pilot Assessment of Microclimate Conditions at Batu Hiu Beach.. Herawati T, Rahayu I, Maqbul I, Saefuramdhan A (2026). Olive ridley sea turtles (Lepidochelys olivacea) continue to experience population pressures across much of their global range, underscoring the need to understand how incubation environments influence reproductive outcomes in conservation settings. Semi-natural hatcheries are widely used in Indonesia, yet quantitative assessments of their microclimatic performance remain limited. This pilot study examined the hatching success of three olive ridley clutches relocated from natural nests to a semi-natural hatchery at Batu Hiu Beach, West Java, between January and May 2025. A total of 303 eggs were relocated within 6 h of oviposition, placed into hand-dug nests that mimicked natural nest dimensions, and incubated under conditions designed to replicate beach microhabitats. Microclimate variables, including daily air temperature and relative humidity, were extracted from ERA5 reanalysis data and matched to each incubation period. Hatching outcomes varied considerably among the three incubation windows, with success rates ranging from 41% to 95%. The clutch incubated under cooler, more thermally stable conditions had the highest success, while the clutch exposed to more variable temperatures had the lowest success. Humidity varied slightly among periods and showed no clear correspondence with differences in reproductive output. These findings suggest the importance of fine-scale thermal stability in supporting embryonic development, consistent with broader evidence from tropical rookeries where temperature is a key driver of reproductive success. The results provide preliminary guidance for improving hatchery management through targeted shading, moisture regulation, and timing of nest relocation. This pilot assessment across three clutches emphasizes the need for multi-season monitoring and in-nest data logging to refine conservation strategies for L. olivacea in Indonesia.",
    "Investigating Anthropogenic and Social Influences on Diet of Semi-Urban Vervet Monkeys Using DNA Metabarcoding.. Felsch J, Mas-Carrió E, Mercier S, Schneider J, Forss S, Van de Waal E, Fumagalli L (2026). With increasing human domination of ecosystems, wildlife must either relocate or adapt its behaviour to anthropogenic impacts in order to survive. Vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus pygerythrus), whose natural habitats have been progressively encroached upon by urban expansion, have successfully adapted to urbanised environments because of their flexible and generalist feeding behaviour. Characterising diet composition of vervet monkeys can therefore reveal how they exploit anthropogenic resources and uncover opportunistic foraging behaviours. However, accurately determining complete diets through direct observations is challenging. In this study, we used an environmental DNA (eDNA) approach investigating the DNA mixtures present in faecal samples as a non-invasive complementary method for assessing diet and foraging strategies. We identified the dietary components of vervet monkeys through DNA metabarcoding of 447 faecal samples collected from two monkey groups over 4 months in a semi-urban neighbourhood in South Africa. We further compared the results with observational data on foraging to describe how vervet monkeys exploit anthropogenic resources. Subsequently, we evaluated whether dietary patterns can be distinguished between groups and within matrilineal levels. We found DNA metabarcoding data to be consistent with observational data, but the former revealed a broader diversity of consumed taxa. Additionally, we detected a difference in diet between the two investigated groups, and a tendency for similar dietary patterns among matrilineal pairs compared to other group members. Our results support the use of the DNA metabarcoding methodology, both to determine the complex diet of omnivorous species in urbanised ecosystems and to address interindividual foraging behaviours.",
    "The Effect of Preeclampsia on the Cell Adhesion, Migration, and Proliferation Potential of Human Umbilical Cord-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells.. Rasheed N, Zahid N, Razzaq SS, Siraj A, Haneef K, Mustajab A, Kaur J (2026). BACKGROUND: Human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) are a well-known source in the field of regenerative medicine. However, their biological features and perinatal environment are compromised by various conditions, such as preeclampsia. Pregnancy-related complications lead to functional impairments, making the cord-isolated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) less efficient in self-renewal and regenerative capacity. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the adhesion, migration, and proliferation potential of hUC-MSCs in preeclamptic conditions. METHODS: MSCs were obtained from umbilical cords of normal and preeclamptic pregnancies, with three samples collected per group. The functional properties of hUC-MSCs, including adhesion, proliferation, migration, and colony formation, were assessed through cell adhesion, wound-healing, and colony-forming unit assays. Moreover, the proliferative potential of hUC-MSCs was determined by calculating the number of population doublings (NPD) and population doubling times (PDT). The expression level of cell cycle-related genes is examined by quantitative PCR. RESULTS: The MSCs isolated from preeclamptic cords exhibit higher PDT (p < 0.01) and reduced NPD (p < 0.05), adhesion (p < 0.001), proliferation (p < 0.01), wound-healing (p < 0.01), and colony formation capabilities. Additionally, preeclampsia-affected hUC-MSCs showed significantly downregulated cell cycle genes, including CDCA2 (0.86-fold, p < 0.01), CDCA8 (0.049-fold, p < 0.001), CDC20 (0.34-fold, p < 0.01), and CCNA2 (0.25-fold, p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The study concludes that MSCs derived from preeclampsia cord show decreased adhesion, migration, and proliferation capabilities compared to normal hUC-MSCs. These findings show that pregnancy complications can influence the biological properties of perinatal stem cells. However, further research is necessary to investigate the underlying mechanisms via which preeclampsia affects the proliferative potential of stem cells, and to identify strategies to increase the proliferation rates of these cells.",
    "Rewired Neuroactive Ligand-Receptor Signaling Confers Adaptive Resistance to BCL-2 Inhibition in AML.. Koyama H, Seo S, Tse W, Bian S, Liu S (2026). A major challenge in treating AML with the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax is the frequent development of drug resistance, which diminishes therapeutic efficacy and leads to patient death. The fundamental mechanisms underlying this resistance are not fully understood. Here, we established venetoclax-resistant cell models of AML that propagate even when the levels of BCL-2, MCL-1, cleaved PARP, and cleaved caspase-9 are reduced, suggesting a BCL-2-independent resistance mechanism. Compared to sensitive cells, resistant Kasumi-1 (VENK) and MV4-11 (VENM) cells exhibit enhanced proliferation both in vitro and in vivo , forming larger and more numerous spheroids and colonies, and displaying higher tumorigenicity in mice. RNA sequencing and KEGG pathway analysis identified the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction (NLRI) pathway as a key vulnerability in both resistant cell lines. While the NLRI pathway contains numerous altered genes, CHRNB4 is the only gene commonly shared and significantly downregulated in both VENK and VENM cells and tumors. Enforced expression of CHRNB4 in resistant cells with low basal expression impaired cell adhesion and colony formation. Clinically, CHRNB4 downregulation is associated with poor AML patient overall survival and predicts a diminished response to venetoclax treatment. This study identifies the NLRI pathway as a crucial vulnerability in venetoclax resistance and unveils CHRNB4 as a promising predictive biomarker for treatment response. These results suggest that targeting the NLRI pathway represents a novel strategy for developing next-generation therapies to improve the poor outcomes of current combination treatments.",
    "Bacteriophage inactivation to prevent carry-over in preclinical assays with mycobacteria.. Torres MP, Morrow C, Guerrero-Bustamante CA, Hatfull GF, Diacon AH, van Ingen J, Janssen S (2026). Background Bacteriophage carry-over, the continued lytic activity of residual phages after experimental sampling, poses a significant challenge in bacteriophage research, potentially skewing experimental results, particularly in the context of preclinical studies where perceived laboratory success may not translate clinically. These inaccuracies, relevant across various bacterial species, underscore the necessity for robust mitigation strategies. This study provides an overview of strategies to mitigate phage carry-over, evaluating their performance on a combination of three mycobacteriophages with lytic activity against M. tuberculosis . Results We investigated three inactivation methods, including ferrous ammonium sulfate (FAS) and citrate for in vitro applications and N-acetyl-L-cysteine-sodium hydroxide (NALC-NaOH) for sputum decontamination. The citrate buffer offered limited and specific phage inactivation, but FAS was effective in inactivating all three mycobacteriophages (FionnbharthΔ45Δ47, Muddy HRM N0157 -2, and Fred313cpm-1Δ33). With pH adapted to 5.0, FAS did not significantly reduce M. tuberculosis H37Rv viability after five minutes exposure. Phage carry-over was determined to be phage-dependent; FionnbharthΔ45Δ47 exhibited the most significant reduction in M. smegmatis colony forming units without phage inactivation measures. Furthermore, we showed that NALC-NaOH methods, commonly used for sputum decontamination, are highly effective in reducing phage titers in aqueous solutions and human sputum samples. Conclusions This study demonstrates the heterogenous and phage-dependent efficacy of available inactivation buffers, underscoring the critical necessity for researchers to empirically screen their specific phage isolates against chosen inactivation methods. This is crucial to ensure that observed antibacterial effects are correctly attributed to phage activity during the experimental period, rather than to uncontrolled phage carry-over, thereby enhancing the reliability and interpretability of results.",
    "Host and Microbe Scale Processes Jointly Shape Spatial Variation in Aphaenogaster (Hymenoptera: Formicidae)associated Wolbachia.. Malagon D, Camper B, Millard S, Recuero E, Caterino M, Greene M, Seekatz A, Bordenstein S, Bordenstein S, Bewick S (2026). The spatial distributions of host-associated (HA) microbes are shaped by the spatial processes of environmental selection and dispersal. However, unlike free-living organisms, HA microbes experience selection and dispersal at two separate spatial scales - the scale of the microbes and the scale of their hosts. Therefore, HA microbes must tolerate both the environment created by their host (microbe-scale environment) and the environment in which their host resides (host-scale environment). Likewise, HA microbes can disperse both between hosts through horizontal or vertical transmission (microbe-scale dispersal) and between locations through host movement (host-scale dispersal). In this paper, we examine how host- and microbe-scale spatial processes contribute to the spatial distribution of Wolbachia endosymbionts in Aphaenogaster fulva-rudis-texana (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) complex ants from Great Smoky Mountains National Park. We begin by identifying significant spatial variation in Wolbachia relative abundance at both the host (across the landscape) and microbe (across host lineages) scales. We then demonstrate a correlation between host- and microbe-scale environmental selection, complicating efforts to isolate the independent effects of host- versus microbe-scale processes. To overcome this challenge, we leverage both the broad distributions of individual host lineages across different environments and sites of co-occurrence between different host lineages within the same environments. This allows us to assess how both host- and microbe-scale processes contribute to spatial variation in our system. Ultimately, our results shed light on the myriad of interacting factors governing spatial variation in HA microbes and why spatial variation in HA microbes is more challenging to understand than spatial variation in free-living organisms.",
    "Age-dependent progenitor switching shapes adult brown adipose tissue heterogeneity.. Ruan HB, Gu C, Zhang Z, Xiong S, Ma J, Shi Z, Huang Z, Shin S, Swaminathan A, Aden I, Moazzami Z, Wu X, Camell C, Jiang Y (2026). The ontogeny of brown adipose tissue (BAT) begins during embryogenesis and continues into the postnatal period and throughout adulthood. Distinct populations of adipose progenitor cells (APCs) have been identified to support BAT development and thermogenesis; however, the division of labor and temporal relationship between different APCs, particularly during adulthood and aging, remain undetermined. Here, we showed that Pdgfra+ APCs establish BAT in early life but have a limited contribution to brown adipogenesis in adult mice housed at room temperature. Using integrative single-cell analysis and lineage tracing, we identified a distinct population of Myl1-expressing cells that emerge in an age-dependent manner and function as committed BAT progenitors in adult and middle-aged mice. Myl1+ APC-derived brown adipocytes possess a unique molecular signature that links to more dependence on oxidative phosphorylation over glycolysis, thus contributing to heterogeneous metabolic activity in adult BAT. The ablation of Myl1+ descendants or the blockade of Myl1+ APC differentiation leads to BAT paucity and impaired glucose metabolism in adult mice. Collectively, our results support a progenitor switching model in which distinct APC populations control sequential brown adipogenesis and shape BAT heterogeneity.",
    "Dynamics and Impact of Repopulating Microglia Following Oligodendroglial Damage.. Di Pietro AA, Thomas L, Pasquini LA (2026). Multiple sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory and demyelinating disease that primarily affects young adults. Active demyelination and neurodegeneration have been associated with early microglial and astroglial activation. While reactive microglia (MG) can contribute to tissue damage and exacerbate neurodegeneration, they also play a neuroprotective role by clearing debris through phagocytosis and secreting growth factors that support repair. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of MG depletion and repopulation on the response to lysophosphatidylcholine-induced oligodendroglial damage using an in vitro model previously characterized by our laboratory. Since microglial development and survival critically depend on colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R) signaling, we employed CSF-1R inhibition with BLZ945 to effectively deplete MG. Results show that repopulation occurs even in demyelinating conditions and, at early time points, results in MG exhibiting a morphology indicative of a less activated phenotype. Despite having higher phagocytic activity, early repopulating MG are few and thus unable to efficiently clear myelin debris. However, these repopulating MG still demonstrated to induce oligodendroglial differentiation. Studies using conditioned media revealed that early repopulating MG release factors into the environment which promote oligodendroglial progenitor cell viability and facilitate oligodendroglial differentiation in a demyelinating context, an effect not observed in neurons. Interestingly, our in vitro results show a close correlation with in vivo findings previously reported and demonstrate the relevance of our model in developing therapies for demyelinating diseases. These findings underscore both the potential and limitations of microglial modulation aimed at eliminating pro-inflammatory profiles and promoting repopulation with pro-regenerative characteristics.",
    "Effectiveness of a Varroosis treatment in managed apiaries: a pilot study.. Loglio G, Salini R, Gatta G, Ricchiuti L, Berjaoui S (2026). Varroa destructor is the main parasitic threat to Apis mellifera colonies worldwide and represents a major concern for honey bee health and apicultural sustainability. Oxalic acid (OA) is widely used for the control of varroosis; however, its efficacy is strongly influenced by the presence of capped brood. This pilot field study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a combined treatment protocol based on Api-Bioxal® administered by trickling and sublimation. The study was carried out in a permanent apiary located in the province of Bergamo (Northern Italy) from October 2024 to February 2025 and involved ten A. mellifera colonies housed in Dadant-Blatt hives. The experimental protocol consisted of one OA trickling treatment followed by two OA sublimations and a control treatment with amitraz. Treatment-induced mite fall was recorded daily for 117 days; brood presence, ambient temperature and pollen influx were monitored throughout the study period, and colony strength was assessed at the beginning and end of the trial using the Liebefeld method. Differences between pre- and post-treatment measurements were analysed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. An overall mean of 563.6 Varroa mites per colony was recorded as treatment-induced mite fall. The highest efficacy of OA was observed when treatments were applied in broodless conditions, whereas the presence of capped brood markedly reduced acaricidal efficacy. No abnormal honey bee mortality or adverse effects on colony health were observed. Colony strength increased in 8 out of 10 colonies, with statistically significant differences between pre- and post-treatment assessments (p < 0.012). These results indicate that Varroa destructor populations remain susceptible to oxalic acid when treatments are properly timed in relation to brood presence. A combined protocol of OA trickling and sublimation may enhance varroosis control without negative effects on colony health. Further large-scale studies are required to confirm these preliminary findings and to support evidence-based adjustments to national Varroa control guidelines.",
    "Conversion of a thelytokous to a stable bisexual line by non-target effect antibiotic elimination of Rickettsia in Anastatus gansuensis.. Gong RN, Chen YM, Hu CC, Tariq H, Ao ZM, Wang JL, Biondi A, Bueno AF, Gugliuzzo A, Zang LS (2026). Heritable symbionts are key modulators of host biology, influencing reproduction and fitness. While antibiotic removal of symbionts is common, non-target effects on host fitness are often understudied. This is particularly true for Rickettsia, a widespread reproductive manipulator, and a stable, long-term (i.e., >7 generations) cured lineage in Hymenoptera has been lacking. This study aimed to fill this methodological gap by generating a cured bisexual lineage of parasitoid wasp with non-target effects of such treatments. Thus, we investigated not only the efficacy but also the non-target effects of three antibiotics: rifampicin, tetracycline, and sulfadiazine, administered at five concentrations (0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 1, and 10 mg/mL) in Rickettsia-infected thelytokous parasitoid Anastatus gansuensis (Hymenoptera: Eupelmidae). Survival, parasitism, emergence, and male rate were evaluated to determine the safety of antibiotic treatments, while Rickettsia titer reduction was used to assess elimination efficacy. Results showed that at a concentration of 0.01 mg/mL, tetracycline and rifampicin had minimal negative effects on host survival, parasitism, and emergence rates. However, prolonged exposure effectively eliminated Rickettsia, leading to the exclusive production of male offspring. Notably, short-term rifampicin feeding (0.01 mg/mL) across multi-generations successfully established a stable Rickettsia-cured bisexual line, confirmed via diagnostic PCR, quantitative PCR, and reproductive phenotyping over 10 generations. In contrast, sulfadiazine, previously effective against Wolbachia, had minimal impact on Rickettsia removal. This study provides a validated protocol for generating genetically stable aposymbiotic lines and a framework for assessing antibiotic specificity and non-target effects, enabling future studies of host adaptation and biological control in Rickettsia-cured parasitoids.",
    "Comparing tree swallow dispersal strategies in a continuous mainland environment.. Hallinger KK, Pegan TM, Andersen MJ, Ardia DR, Belmaker A, Chang van Oordt D, Ferretti V, Forsman AM, Gaul JR, Llambías PE, Orzechowski SC, Shipley JR, Stager M, Taff CC, Uehling JJ, Verhoeven MA, Vitousek MN, Wilson M, Yoon HS, Wrege PH, Winkler DW (2026). Dispersal is one of the most important aspects of animal behavior and can have far-reaching consequences for organismal ecology and evolution. Despite recent theoretical advances in understanding why individuals within the same population vary in dispersal behavior, relatively few studies have empirically evaluated the long-term causes and consequences of variable dispersal within natural populations. In this study, we used life history data collected over the course of 16 years to examine fitness outcomes in 867 known-age female tree swallows breeding in New York, USA, that differed in their dispersal status: \"immigrant\" females, defined as dispersers that hatched elsewhere, and \"local\" females, defined as non-dispersers that hatched within the study site and returned there after migration to breed. We also compared the life history responses of immigrant and local females to natural variation in weather, nest predation risk, and social environment at their breeding site. Local females were more likely to produce fledglings that recruited into the study area as adults. We also found several instances in which dispersal status interacted with an environmental metric to influence relative fitness, and these responses were largely consistent across life history measures. Overall, immigrant females were relatively resilient to variation in their extrinsic environment, while local females were highly sensitive to environmental conditions at the breeding site, performing relatively well when conditions were benign and faring relatively poorly as conditions became more stressful. We found little evidence that distance dispersed within a study site impacted female fitness, suggesting that the dispersal-associated differences in fitness that we observed operate mostly across broader spatial scales. Future work should undertake the direct and simultaneous measurement of behavior, physiology, and fitness of immigrant and local females across environmental contexts and should seek to understand whether and how context-dependent fitness variation of dispersers and non-dispersers scales up to influence larger ecological and evolutionary processes.",
    "PTTG1 regulates the TGF-β/Smad pathway to promote the growth and metastasis of gastric cancer cells.. Wang D, Geng H, Xia Z, Qiu C (2026). BACKGROUND: Pituitary tumor-transforming gene 1 (PTTG1) has been implicated in multiple malignancies; however, its precise role and regulatory mechanism in gastric cancer remain unclear. This study aimed to determine how PTTG1 regulates cell proliferation, migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway in gastric cancer. METHODS: PTTG1 expression in gastric cancer was evaluated using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets and subsequently validated by western blotting in gastric cancer cell lines. To investigate the biological functions of PTTG1, functional assays including CCK8, colony formation, and Transwell migration and invasion assays were performed following PTTG1 knockdown in SGC-7901 and HGC-27 cells. The effects on EMT were further examined by assessing EMT-related markers by western blotting. Tumorigenic and metastatic potential in vivo was determined using a nude mouse xenograft model. The regulatory influence of PTTG1 on the TGF-β/Smad pathway was analyzed by measuring the expression levels of TGF-β, Smad2, Smad3, and their phosphorylated forms. RESULTS: PTTG1 expression was significantly upregulated in gastric cancer tissues compared with normal gastric mucosa according to TCGA data and validation in cell lines. Silencing PTTG1 in SGC-7901 and HGC-27 cells markedly inhibited proliferation and colony formation (p < 0.01), and suppressed migration and invasion (p < 0.01). Western blotting revealed increased E-cadherin and reduced N-cadherin, α-SMA, and Vimentin expression after PTTG1 knockdown. In vivo, xenograft tumor growth was significantly reduced in nude mice injected with si-PTTG1 cells compared with controls (n = 6 per group; p < 0.05). Mechanistically, PTTG1 depletion attenuated TGF-β, phosphorylated Smad2, and phosphorylated Smad3 levels, indicating inhibition of the TGF-β/Smad pathway. CONCLUSION: PTTG1 promotes gastric cancer progression by activating the TGF-β/Smad axis to enhance cell proliferation, invasion, and EMT. These findings highlight PTTG1 as a potential diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target in gastric cancer.",
    "Biosynthetic OMVs with endogenous GM-CSF loading for ultrasound-triggered in situ cancer vaccination.. Zhang R, Zhang B, Duan S, Xu X, Jiang R, Zhao Y, Li Z, Zhang X, Yang S, Sang M, Zhang L, Zhang J, Wang Y, Zhang L (2026). Impaired dendritic cell (DC) recruitment, maturation, and antigen presentation within the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) critically limit the efficacy of cancer immunotherapies. Strategies attempt to restore DC function using systemically administered granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) are constrained by poor tumor accumulation and dose-limiting toxicity. Herein, we developed a biosynthetic, ultrasound-triggered in situ cancer vaccine based on a hybrid nanoplatform (OMVsGM-Lip@Ce6) that integrates GM-CSF-expressing bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVsGM) with pH/ultrasound-responsive liposomes encapsulating the sonosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6). In the acidic TME, the hybrid vesicles destabilize, enabling localized release of biosynthetically loaded GM-CSF. Subsequent local ultrasound irradiation activates Ce6 to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), inducing immunogenic cell death (ICD) and thereby promoting the in situ release of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). These endogenous danger signals, together with pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) intrinsically carried by OMVs, synergize with locally delivered GM-CSF to enhance DC recruitment, expansion, and maturation, ultimately facilitating efficient antigen presentation and priming of tumor-specific T-cell responses. This biosynthetic OMVs-based platform thus realizes spatially controlled GM-CSF delivery and self-adjuvanted in situ cancer vaccination, effectively remodeling the immunosuppressive TME and eliciting robust systemic antitumor immunity to overcome resistance to immunotherapy.",
    "Metformin inhibits non-small cell lung cancer via lncRP11-242D8.1.. Tian X, Qiao Z, Ma Y, Yang R, Zheng Y, He W, Xu Y (2026). OBJECTIVES: Metformin may exert anticancer effects in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by influencing long non-coding RNAs involved in the disease's pathology. The Study aimed to investigate the inhibitory effect of metformin on NSCLC by modulating the expression of lncRP11-242D8.1. METHODS: Inflammation and apoptosis levels in NSCLC were assessed at the molecular level using immunofluorescence, RT-qPCR, and ELISA. Metformin's effects on NSCLC in vitro were evaluated by CCK8, scratch wound healing, Transwell, colony formation, flow cytometry assays, etc. Bioinformatics analysis and molecular experiments were combined to investigate the mechanisms involving metformin and lncRP11-242D8.1. RESULTS: Low expression of lncRP11-242D8.1 is positively correlated with increased inflammation and decreased apoptosis, leading to poor prognosis in NSCLC. Treatment with metformin in the H1299 cell model improved this trend. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that metformin treats NSCLC by upregulating lncRP11-242D8.1 expression, which inhibits inflammation and promotes apoptosis, offering a new perspective for clinical treatment.",
    "Comparison of proteomes and biofunctional properties of male and female common adder (Vipera berus) venoms.. Schulte L, Engelhardt M, Eichberg J, Cabrera-Orefice A, Wölfel H, Damm M, Avella I, Kreuels B, Hardes K, Eble JA, Vilcinskas A, Lüddecke T (2026). Snake venom is an ecologically critical functional trait, primarily applied for foraging and accordingly shaped by selective pressures. Recent insights underpinned the high variability of snake venoms down to the intraspecific level, with regional, ontogenetic, and seasonal variation being mostly investigated. In contrast, sex-based venom variation has received considerably less attention so far, and its influence on venom compositions is poorly described. Here, we compare venom profiles and bioactivity from pooled male and female samples of Central European adders (Vipera berus) to provide insights into potential sex-based venom variation in this species. Proteomics, paired with SDS-PAGE and RP-HPLC, revealed highly similar venom profiles. Likewise, phospholipases A2 and proteases activity profiling, as well as bioassays targeting the effects of venom on the coagulation cascade and the viability of different mammalian cell lines revealed similar activity spectra. Our results do not suggest a noteworthy extent of sex-based intraspecific venom variation in V. berus. We further discuss our data in light of the species' venom composition at larger geographic scales and its clinical relevance. This work contributes to a clearer framework for understanding venom biology in the world's most widespread medically relevant venomous snake.",
    "Biological effectiveness of superficial X-ray in mammalian cells through precise dosimetry and Monte Carlo simulations.. Barghash R, Chailapakul P, Prebble AR, Leary D, Kato TA (2026). This study evaluates the radiobiological effectiveness comparing superficial X-rays to Cs-137 in V79 and U2OS cells cultured in T25 flasks using colony formation assays. Additional dosimetric care was given to maintaining equal absolute dose for all beam qualities, correcting for absorption and scattering in the flask, and quantifiable interpretation due to dose of the spatial differences in cell survival with significantly higher survival near the flask's edges. Ion chamber measurements quantified flask lid attenuation (6.9 %, 2.4 %, and 1.9 % for 50, 70, and 100 kVp), enabling dose correction for accurate survival analysis. CT-based Monte Carlo simulations revealed thicker flask walls and the meniscus effect created a 35 % dose reduction from flask center to edges, directly explaining the observed survival patterns. Monte Carlo simulation also predicted an increased secondary electron production at higher energies. These results emphasize the necessity of precise dosimetry in low-energy X-ray studies. Combined experimental and computational approaches enhanced reliability of radiobiological assessments. Survival curves yielded Relative Biological Effectiveness (RBE) values for 50 kVp X-ray of 1.45 (V79) and 1.64 (U2OS); 1.41 (V79) and 1.55 (U2OS) at 70 kVp; and 1.23 (V79) and 1.36 (U2OS) at 100 kVp, relative to Cs-137.",
    "Multimerization approach to improve a cell surface plectin binding cancer stem cell targeted peptoid drug‑lead.. Ansah CO, Udugamasooriya DG (2026). Cancer stem cells (CSCs) or tumor-initiating cells represent a drug-resistant subpopulation with self-renewal and metastatic capacity. There are no CSC-specific drugs that have been developed so far. Plectin is a cytoskeletal protein that uniquely translocates to the outer cell membrane (surface translocated plectin - STP) in CSCs and contributes to proliferation, migration, invasion, and metastasis. We previously identified an STP targeted peptoid-PCS2, and the dimeric version PCS2D1.2, which selectively binds to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) derived CSCs, displayed both in vitro and in vivo anti-cancer activity. The current study reports the identification of the minimum pharmacophore and the optimization of PCS2D1.2 to obtain an improved version of trimeric peptoid PCS2T3.9. Various multimerization strategies with linker optimization and truncation of non-important residues resulted in PCS2T3.9, which demonstrated 21-fold improvement of the cytotoxic activity against high STP expressing H358 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, while showing minimum effects on low STP expressing H460 cells. PCS2T3.9 had no cytotoxic activity on normal bronchial epithelial HBEC-3KT cells. Furthermore, PCS2T3.9 effectively suppressed colony formation and cell migration-hallmarks of CSC phenotype-specifically in H358 cells but not in H460 cells. These findings strongly correlate high STP expression with cancer stemness characteristics and confirm the selective targeting of PCS2T3.9 on CSCs, producing anti-cancer activity. The highly specific and selective cytotoxic effects of PCS2T3.9 on STP-enriched CSCs offer a significant therapeutic advantage by potentially minimizing off-target effects on normal tissues, establishing this peptoid as a promising candidate for CSC-specific NSCLC therapy development.",
    "Colorimetric/fluorescent dual-mode biosensor for Staphylococcus aureus based on inner filter effect between AuNPs and Si/CsPbBr(3) quantum dot materials.. Liu S, Zhang S, Zhang Y, Yan X, Feng K, Luo Y, Yao J, Liu T, Yuan Y, Yue T, Sheng Q (2026). Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), a prevalent foodborne pathogen, poses a serious threat to human health, highlighting the urgent need for reliable and sensitive detection methods. Given the limitations of single-mode sensors such as false positives/negatives, a colorimetric and fluorescent dual-mode biosensor based on quantum dot material was proposed for the evaluation of S. aureus in food. This sensor utilized CsPbBr3@SiO2 quantum dots as a stable fluorescent probe. The sensing mechanism relies on the inner filter effect, where gold nanoparticles effectively quench the fluorescence of CsPbBr3@SiO2, enabling rapid and highly sensitive biosensing. Under optimized conditions, the biosensor achieved a broad detection range of 1 to 106 colony-forming unit/mL (CFU/mL), with low detection limits of 103 CFU/mL for colorimetric mode and 0.54 CFU/mL for fluorescent mode. It also exhibited excellent selectivity and was successfully applied to analyze various food samples. This study demonstrates perovskite nanomaterials as a visual tool for detecting foodborne pathogens in complex matrices.",
    "Research note: Time of day and age affect hen activity patterns in two designs of cage-free aviaries.. Ma X, Siegford JM, Ambike V, Jacobs JA, Swanson JC, Widowski TM, Ali ABA (2026). The laying hen industry is transitioning to cage-free housing, including multi-tiered aviaries, yet research on how aviary configuration influences movement is limited. We examined activity patterns in hens acclimating to two aviary designs. We hypothesized that hen age, time of day (TOD), and aviary design would influence activity. A total of 2,464 Hy-Line Brown hens were placed in two aviary designs (N60 and STEP) at 16 weeks of age (WOA), each replicated across two rooms with four pens per room. The two designs varied in litter accessibility and nest placement. At 18, 28, and 59 WOA, two focal hens per pen (n = 32/WOA) were fitted with triaxial accelerometers. Activity was analyzed for four one-hour periods on the recording day: 1 hour after lights on (morning), 1 hour during noon feeding (noon), 1 hour without management events (afternoon), and 1 hour before lights off (evening). A generalized linear mixed model was used to test the effects of design, age, and TOD, with room and individual hen included as random effects. Horizontal activity showed a significant age × TOD × design interaction (p < 0.0001). Evening consistently had the highest horizontal activity, while morning was typically lowest, except in specific age × design combinations. Vertical activity also showed a significant three-way interaction (p < 0.0001). Vertical activity peaked at 28 WOA across TOD and designs and was lowest at 18 WOA across most TOD in both designs. In summary, horizontal and vertical activity patterns were influenced by the combined effects of age, TOD, and aviary design. The significant three-way interactions indicate that these effects were context-dependent, with movement patterns shaped by the interplay of daily routines, housing design, and age of hens rather than any single factor alone.",
    "Acute liver injury in hospitalized children: clinical and etiological profile from a tropical country.. Agrwal S, Kumari S, Pandey P, Attri K, Samanta A, Pal Yadav T, Chandra J (2026). BACKGROUND: Clinical spectrum of children presents with acute liver injury (ALI) is quite wide, ranging from asymptomatic enzyme elevation to severe hepatic dysfunction. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical and etiological profile and outcomes of children 1 month to 12 years presented with ALI at a tertiary care hospital in North India. METHODS: This prospective observational study enrolled 132 children with AL. Detailed clinical evaluation, liver function tests, and etiological workups were performed. The severity of ALI was classified based on liver enzyme levels, and patient's diagnosis and outcomes were assessed. RESULTS: Among the enrolled children (47.7% female, mean age 69.3 months), fever (85.6%) was the most common presenting symptom. ALI severity was classified as mild (29.5%), moderate (15.1%), and severe (55.3%). The leading cause of ALI was Acute Viral hepatitis (37.1%), followed by Enteric fever (21.9%) and Dengue fever. Non-Hepatotropic viruses such as Influenza, Adenovirus were identified in 11 (8.3%). Infants primarily presented with mild ALI related to viral infections, whereas children aged 1-5 years and >5 years had higher proportions of severe ALI. Follow-up investigations at two weeks showed improvement in 77.1% of patients, while 22.9% had persistent liver enzyme elevation. CONCLUSION: Infectious causes, particularly viral hepatitis, remain the predominant etiology of ALI in Indian children. Severe ALI was frequently associated with viral hepatitis, Enteric fever and dengue. In addition, Non-hepatotropic viruses are important cause of ALI. Consideration of these common illnesses is important to avoid unnecessary investigations and parental anxiety.",
    "Environmental conditions shape the global distribution of ant societies.. Pérochon E, Guénard B, Gippet JMW, Klaftenberger T, Ollier S, Bertelsmeier C (2026). Sociality has evolved several times and is a key strategy for overcoming environmental challenges and promoting ecological success. Yet, it remains unclear how environmental conditions shape global variation in social traits of animals. With their diverse societies and global distribution, ants are ideal to test whether environmental conditions influence the distribution of animal social traits worldwide. Here, we used trait data for a total of 3,299 ant species to explore how three key social traits (reproductive structure, colony size, and worker polymorphism) vary with environmental conditions globally. We show that trait compositions are strongly structured by biomes, indicating that habitat types, as well as environmental factors like temperature and seasonality, influence sociality. Our findings highlight the crucial role of the environment in shaping the global distribution of sociality in ants, contributing to a better understanding of how complex animal societies evolved.",
    "Failure of Endophthalmitis Prophylaxis: A Laboratory Model Comparing Antibiotics and Bacterial Loads.. Moon M, Mathews S, Mahjabin F, Karaiskos K, Libre PE (2026). PURPOSE: To assess by an in vitro model the influence of antibiotic agent and bacterial load upon the failure of intracameral endophthalmitis prophylaxis. SETTING: Microbiology laboratory. DESIGN: Bacterial growth comparison. METHODS: Bacteria were incubated with moxifloxacin, cefuroxime, ceftazidime or imipenem. Antibiotic concentrations were approximately twice those achieved by standard clinical intracameral doses. Bacterial loads were either low or high (0.0025 or 0.25 McFarland). The tested strains included 4 Enterococcus faecium, 7 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 8 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 3 Streptococcus pneumoniae, and 6 Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Samples were diluted by half every 2 hours to model the half-life of intracameral antibiotics. Bacterial broths were plated at 24 hours, and colonies were counted at 48 hours. Samples with >250 colony forming units/mL (CFU/mL) were deemed failures. RESULTS: Antibiotics that successfully eliminated a pathogen often failed when the bacterial load was 100 times greater. Moxifloxacin had no failures against low load pathogens. Moxifloxacin and ceftazidime both had significantly fewer failures than cefuroxime (p<0.01; p>0.02). Ceftazidime was far more effective than cefuroxime against gram negatives, but less effective against low load enterococci. CONCLUSIONS: High bacterial loads can multiply uncontrollably in the presence of antibiotics which are effective when the bacterial load is lower; this underscores the importance of uncontaminated equipment and ocular surface antisepsis. Broadest coverage against common postoperative endophthalmitis pathogens was demonstrated by moxifloxacin and ceftazidime.",
    "Slowpoke: An Automated Golden Gate Cloning Workflow for Opentrons OT-2 and Flex.. Malcı K, Meng F, Galez H, Franja Da Silva A, Caro-Astorga J, Batt G, Ellis T (2026). In synthetic biology, DNA assembly is a routine process where increasing demands for standardization, high-throughput capacity, and error-free execution are driving the development of accessible, automated solutions. Here, we present Slowpoke, a user-friendly and flexible workflow for Golden Gate-based cloning designed for the popular entry-cost, open-source liquid-handling platforms Opentrons OT-2 and Flex. Slowpoke automates the key steps of the DNA assembly process, including cloning, Escherichia coli transformation, plating, and colony PCR, requiring user intervention primarily for colony picking and plate transfers. To further simplify the usage, we developed a free graphical user interface (GUI), available at https://slowpoke.streamlit.app/, which enables rapid protocol generation through simple file uploads. We validated the workflow using two Golden Gate-based toolkits, the MoClo Yeast Toolkit (YTK), and SubtiToolKit (STK). High assembly efficiencies were achieved across platforms for basic transcript unit constructions: 17/17 positive colonies with YTK on OT-2, 11/12 on Flex, and 8/13 with STK on OT-2. High-throughput assemblies were also performed with six parts in Flex using YTK-compatible parts, and 55 out of 57 combinations resulted in correct constructs. These results confirm the robustness and adaptability of the workflow across toolkit complexity and automation platforms. The Slowpoke suite, including code scripts and templates, is freely available at https://github.com/Tom-Ellis-Lab/Slowpoke, offering an accessible and modular solution for automating Golden Gate cloning in synthetic biology laboratories.",
    "An analysis of farmers' experiences with deterrence methods and investment in mitigation of agricultural crop damage caused by geese.. Sørensen SL, Madsen J, Balsby TJS (2026). The number of geese foraging in agricultural fields and causing damage to crops is increasing. Farmers attempt to reduce damage using passive, active, auditory, and combined deterrent measures, accommodation fields and, increasingly, derogation shooting. For protected geese like the barnacle goose Branta leucopsis and huntable species outside the hunting season, it is a legal requirement within the EU that other deterrent measures have proven insufficient before a derogation permit can be granted. However, there is a lack of guidance regarding the effectiveness of different measures. Via in-person interviews with 54 Danish farmers experiencing problems with wintering barnacle geese we analyse farmers' experiences with deterrence methods to provide an overview of their effectiveness, defined by duration and area coverage. The information obtained is far more extensive than what could realistically be achieved through scientific experiments. We check the validity of responses by comparing reports with existing scientific evidence. Passive deterrents (e.g., scarecrows) cover a few hectares and have a duration effect of 4-6 days, but only until the geese habituate. Active measures (e.g., a person walking into the field) and auditory deterrents (firing scare shots) have high area effect but short duration. Largest area/duration effects are achieved using gas cannons, sound deterrents and derogation shooting. Intensified active deterrence or increased density of passive deterrents enhance effectiveness but require greater investments of time and resources. Effective derogation shooting requires that hunters can respond quickly when needed. Hunting lease agreements regarding hunters' contributions to deterrence and derogation can enhance cooperation and problem-solving. In addition, cooperation between neighboring farmers, including accommodation areas, furthers effectiveness. The cost of geese (yield loss plus time/materials) can have a sizeable impact on the farmers' operation profits. Lack of effort may be due to farmers either coping with the problem, having given up deterrence, or unawareness of more effective deterrence.",
    "Selective cytotoxicity of solamargine via oxidative stress and caspase-independent mechanisms in human glioblastoma cells.. Ribeiro AB, de Melo Junqueira M, Furtado RA, Bastos JK, Tavares DC (2026). IDH-wild-type glioblastoma (IDH-wildtype GB) is an aggressive and genetically heterogeneous tumor characterized by intrinsic resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, while surgical resection remains inherently limited by its diffuse infiltrative growth, leading to poor clinical outcomes. Natural products such as solamargine (SM), a steroidal glycoalkaloid with cytotoxic and antitumor properties, have emerged as potential adjuvant strategies. Here, we investigated the effects of SM on proliferation, clonogenic survival, morphology and migration of IDH-wildtype GB cell lines (U-87MG, U-251MG and T98-G) and non-tumoral astrocytes under normoxic and hypoxic conditions, as well as its interaction with temozolomide (TMZ). Under normoxia, SM reduced cell viability in a dose- and time-dependent manner, with IC₅₀ values between 5.04 and 9.53 μM and showed enhanced cytotoxicity under hypoxia. TMZ alone displayed modest activity, and its combination with SM produced predominantly antagonistic effects. Clonogenic assays confirmed the antiproliferative potential of SM, with significant inhibition of colony formation at 2.5 μM. SM induced marked morphological alterations but did not significantly impair migration in wound-healing assays. In U-87MG cells, SM triggered G₂/M cell-cycle arrest, increased intracellular reactive oxygen species generation, and elevated γH2AX protein expression, indicating oxidative stress-associated DNA damage. However, cleaved caspase-3 and p53 were not detected, suggesting a predominantly non-apoptotic mode of cell death. Together, these findings support SM as a promising candidate for IDH-wildtype GB therapy and underscore the need for further studies to clarify its mechanisms of action and optimize its therapeutic use.",
    "Evaluation of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy with Butyl toluidine blue O for inactivation of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans biofilm.. Tortamano ACAC, Kassa CT, Magalhães FD, Ferreira GF, de Holanda Lima S, Pavani C, Rodriguez VS, Kato IT, Wainwright M, Prates RA (2026). As an adjunctive intervention to mechanical periodontal treatment, antimicrobial photodynamic therapy aims to induce the production of reactive oxygen species, thereby reducing microbial infection. Butyl toluidine blue O, a novel photosensitizer from the phenothiazine family, was developed through physicochemical modifications of the structure of toluidine blue, demonstrating decreased aggregation and increased singlet oxygen production and lipophilicity. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of butyl toluidine blue O on Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans biofilm. A biofilm was grown on bovine dental samples, followed by the application of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy. The experimental design included the following groups: Control, Light, incubation with PS without irradiation (0), and three aPDT groups (1, 3, or 5 min of irradiation time duration). A laser with a wavelength of 660 nm and 100 mW of radiant power was employed. After the procedures, the samples were cultivated under microaerophilic conditions, counted, and converted into colony-forming units for analysis and comparison. The samples exhibiting statistically significant differences were analyzed through scanning electron microscopy. Antimicrobial photodymanic therapy with 5 min irradiation period achieved a 99.99% reduction in biofilm microbial load. In conclusion, the approach mediated by butyl toluidine blue O demonstrated efficacy against A. actinomycetemcomitans biofilm.",
    "Efficacy and safety of trilaciclib to prevent chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression in advanced solid tumors: a systematic review and meta-analysis.. Ahmed M, Umer M, Deeksha FNU, Shahid R, Siddiqi AR, Ahmad TZ, Panhwar H, Zahid S, Zia A, Azam B, Bajwa AY, Khan OA, Rehman AU, Faisal MS, Weerakoon N (2026). BACKGROUND: Trilaciclib is a cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor that has shown promise in mitigating chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression (CIM). This meta-analysis aims to provide a comprehensive and clinically relevant quantification of trilaciclib's effectiveness in reducing CIM and its potential impact on outcomes in adult patients with solid tumors. METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies evaluating trilaciclib administered along with chemotherapy in adult patients (≥ 18 years) with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Databases searched included PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and major trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov, EU Clinical Trials Register, ICTRP) up to May 21, 2025. Primary outcomes were incidence of grade 3/4 neutropenia, febrile neutropenia (FN), need for granulocyte-colony stimulating factors (G-CSF)/erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA), and need for red blood cell/platelet transfusions. Efficacy endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and objective response rate (ORR). Pooled odds ratios (OR) or hazard ratios (HR) were calculated using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed with the I2 statistic. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were conducted to explore the robustness of results and sources of heterogeneity. RESULTS: Ten studies with a total of 979 patients were included, with 586 receiving trilaciclib alongside chemotherapy and 393 receiving chemotherapy alone. Pooled analysis showed that trilaciclib decreased the incidence of grade 3/4 neutropenia by 79% (OR = 0.21; 95% CI: 0.08-0.52; I2 = 71%), febrile neutropenia (FN) by 75% (OR = 0.25; 95% CI: 0.14-0.46; I2 = 0%), grade 3/4 anemia by 60% (OR = 0.40; 95% CI: 0.28-0.57; I2 = 0%), and reduced ESA use by 56% (OR = 0.44; 95% CI: 0.26-0.77; I2 = 0%). Significant improvements were also observed in PFS (HR = 0.77; 95% CI: 0.66-0.90; I2 = 0%) and OS (HR = 0.58; 95% CI: 0.36-0.94; I2 = 72%). Trilaciclib use was not associated with a significant increase in the incidence of adverse events. CONCLUSION: Trilaciclib significantly reduced CIM and the need for hematopoietic support during chemotherapy. It also showed a positive impact on efficacy outcomes without compromising chemotherapy effectiveness or increasing toxicity. Overall, our findings support trilaciclib's evolving role as a promising adjunct to chemotherapy protocols in appropriately selected patients.",
    "Gene expression profiling to elucidate the promotive effects of the volatile organic compound 3-octanone on the mycelial growth of Ganoderma lucidum.. Horikawa S, Iizuka R, Umezawa K, Konuma R, Yoshida M (2026). To investigate the effects of fungal volatile organic compounds (FVOCs) on the mycelial growth of Ganoderma lucidum, and to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the growth-promoting effect of 3-octanone. G. lucidum was cultivated with 1-octen-3-ol, 3-octanol and 3-octanone for 7 days, after which colony diameter and mycelial dry weight were measured to assess their effects on mycelial growth. RNA-seq was used to investigate gene expression changes following 3-octanone exposure. While 1-octen-3-ol or 3-octanol inhibited mycelial growth in G. lucidum, 3-octanone promoted it. In total, 590 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including 162 upregulated and 428 downregulated genes, were identified following 3-octanone exposure. Functional annotation revealed that among the DEGs, 23 genes were related to fungal cell wall biosynthesis and remodeling, whereas 21 genes were involved in plant-derived polysaccharide degradation. Furthermore, significant expression changes were observed in genes related to secondary metabolism. Our results indicate that G. lucidum can use 3-octanone as a signal to recognize other fungi, potentially facilitating the expansion of its own territory within wood in nature.",
    "Magnetoreception in Cataglyphis hellenica ants.. Tenneriello C, Wegmann JW, Fleischmann PN (2026). Magnetoreception is the ability of animals to detect and use the geomagnetic field (GMF) for spatial orientation. Cataglyphis ants are experimental models for insect navigation and magnetoreception. At the beginning of their foraging life, Cataglyphis ants perform learning walks (LWs), explorative excursions around the nest, with pirouettes (tight turns about the ants' body axes). During a pirouette, an ant gazes to the nest entrance, an invisible hole in the ground. Until now, Cataglyphis nodus has been the only desert ant species shown to use the GMF to align their gazes to the nest entrance during LW pirouettes. In the present study, we show that Cataglyphis hellenica, phylogenetically distant from C. nodus, but inhabiting the same environment, also possesses a magnetic sense. When C. hellenica ants are exposed to an experimental alteration of the GMF (alteration of the horizontal component about 180° or + 120°), they gaze to the fictive position of the nest entrance. This study demonstrates that C. hellenica ants use the GMF to gaze back to the nest entrance, confirming the presence of magnetoreception in a second Cataglyphis species, in addition to C. nodus. This suggests that the use of the GMF for path integration is rather common than unique in Cataglyphis species.",
    "Fraxinellone Inhibited Immune Evasion and Cell Growth by Inactivating HIF-1α/STAT3/PD-L1 Signaling in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma.. Wang Q, Bian B, Zhang L, Duan P, Bian H, Zhang G, Li K (2026). Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), the predominant histological subtype constituting approximately 80% of all esophageal malignancies worldwide, represents a significant global disease burden with distinct geographical predilection. Fraxinellone (FRA) was reported to function as a tumor suppressor in several tumors, while the role of FRA in ESCC remains unclear. In the present study, we found that FRA treatment significantly inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation of ESCC cells. On the contrary, FRA treatment promoted cell apoptosis of ESCC cells by downregulating Bcl-2 protein and upregulating Bax and C-caspase3 proteins. Besides, FRA pretreatment suppressed proliferation and viability of CD8+ T cells but facilitated cell apoptosis in co-culturing system. Moreover, FRA pretreatment restrained immune evasion by attenuating CD8+ T cell activation. Mechanistically, FRA effectively inactivated HIF-1α/STAT3/PD-L1 signaling in ESCC cells and xenograft tumors. Ultimately, FRA treatment inhibited tumor growth in vivo. In conclusions, FRA inhibited ESCC cell growth and immune evasion by inactivating HIF-1α/STAT3/PD-L1 signaling in vitro and vivo. This study suggested that FRA may serve as a potential therapeutic agent for ESCC treatment.",
    "Beaked whale (Ziphiidae) foraging along Australia's Northwest Shelf.. Madhusudhana S, Erbe C, Sidenko E, McCauley RD (2026). Beaked whales are elusive deep-diving odontocetes, and their distribution and foraging ecology remain poorly documented in Australian waters. This study presents a passive acoustic monitoring (PAM)-based assessment of beaked whale foraging activity along Australia's Northwest Shelf-a continental shelf region with features typically conducive to beaked whale sustenance. The area is also of economic significance due to ongoing offshore oil and gas production, commercial fishing, and commercial shipping, raising concerns about potential impacts on these deep-diving cetaceans. This study collected year-long underwater acoustic datasets from three deep-water sites in the region. Using a semi-automated workflow based on correlogram visualizations, the study identified beaked whale foraging buzzes-short, rapid echolocation click trains associated with prey capture attempts. Analyses revealed year-round foraging activity, with significantly higher levels at night, but no strong spatial or seasonal variations across the study area. These findings suggest persistent use of the region by beaked whales despite offshore industry presence, underscoring the ecological significance of these deep-water habitats. This study highlights the value of PAM, combined with efficient analytical approaches, for monitoring cryptic species in data-limited, industrialized marine environments.",
    "Synergistic pharmacotherapy for epilepsy: NPY (3-36)-modified ZIF-90 nanoparticles co-delivering GW2580.. Cao P, Geng C, Ren X, Chu X, Zhai Y, Li W, Wu C (2026). Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders, with current antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) being ineffective in up to 30% of patients. Moreover, the therapeutic efficacy of existing AEDs is significantly limited by the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The neuropeptide Y2 receptor is a potential antiepileptic target, with NPY (3-36) acting as its selective agonist. GW2580, an inhibitor of the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor, has neuroprotective potential. In this study, a novel nanocomposite, NPY@ZIF-RG, was synthesized by covalently conjugating NPY (3-36) onto the surface of GW2580-encapsulated nano-Zeolitic imidazolate framework-90 (ZIF-90) via a simple post-modification. The biosafety of NPY@ZIF-RG was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. The BBB permeability and its effects on neuroinflammation and neuronal excitability were assessed. The therapeutic efficacy of NPY@ZIF-RG was explored using immunohistochemistry, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and behavioral tests in a mouse model of kainic acid-induced acute epilepsy. The results indicated that NPY@ZIF-RG exhibited excellent biocompatibility and efficient BBB penetration. Furthermore, it exerted beneficial therapeutic effects by inhibiting microglia-mediated inflammation and reducing excitatory glutamate release. NPY@ZIF-RG alleviated hippocampal neuronal loss and cognitive dysfunction by co-delivering GW2580 and NPY (3-36), which exerted synergistic neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects. This study provides a promising nanocomposite drug-delivery system for the treatment of epilepsy.",
    "Sensory Biology of the Franciscana (Pontoporia blainville, Pontoporiidae, Cetartiodactyla): Ontogenetic Modifications of Vibrissae and Vibrissal Crypts.. Krmpotic CM, Loza CM, Scarano AC, Andrés-Laube PF, Acuña F, Loureiro JP, Zanuzzi CN, Castro NN, Pombo MT, von Fersen L, Barbeito CG (2026). The transition of cetaceans from a terrestrial to an aquatic environment involved a crucial sensory adaptation in environments with limited visibility. Vibrissae, important mechanoreceptors, undergo an ontogenetic transformation in odontocetes. Although most lose them early in life, their follicles persist as innervated vibrissal crypts, suggesting a continuous sensory function. In some species, these crypts could function as mechanoreceptors, electroreceptors, or even be involved in magnetoreception. The Franciscana (Pontoporia blainvillei) is a species restricted to the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean. It currently faces high mortality rates due to incidental capture in gillnets, which has led to its current classification as Vulnerable. This research describes the histomorphology of vibrissae and crypts in different developmental stages. The samples were processed using routine histological techniques, immunohistochemistry, and scanning electron microscopy. In neonates, the emerging and innervated vibrissae probably are important for lactation. Subsequently, the vibrissal hair is lost or involutes , being replaced in juveniles and adults by an innervated pseudohair that likely maintains a mechanoreceptive function, although its micromorphology also suggests a potential electroreception. The maturation of the echolocation system, which allows for a broader diet, coincides with these changes in the vibrissae. This suggests that the initial mechanoreceptive structures, linked to lactation, evolve to complement hearing and foraging within low-visibility environments.",
    "Forest stand characteristics drive the macronutrient composition of Vaccinium winter forage for cervids.. Felton AM, Juvany L, Hedwall PO, Felton A, Erbrech J, Sayn A, Morel J, Wallgren M, Jarnemo A, Schönbeck L, Spitzer R (2026). Shrubs of the genus Vaccinium serve as foundation species in boreal ecosystems as they define much of the structure of the ground vegetation and play key roles in many ecosystem services and processes. For example, Vaccinium myrtillus (bilberry) and Vaccinium vitis-idaea (cowberry) constitute staple foods for several species of large herbivores (Cervidae, deer) in Northern Europe. However, changes to the tree layer from forestry practices have resulted in declines in habitat suitability and the abundance of these shrubs over recent decades. Here, we assess whether related changes to tree basal area and species composition also affect the macronutrient composition of these shrubs, and if so, how such alterations may influence food selection by moose (Alces alces). We sampled bilberry and cowberry twigs during wintertime in five study areas dispersed latitudinally in Sweden, using 65 forest stands dominated by Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) or Norway spruce (Picea abies) that varied in age and site fertility, while also taking into account soil C:N, pH, and moisture. We found that the macronutrient composition of bilberry and cowberry forage was significantly altered by forest density and tree species composition. In denser and more spruce-dominated forests (i.e., lower understory light), forage contained less nonstructural carbohydrates, but more protein and lignin, compared to shrubs growing in more open and pine-dominated forests. We also found that the forage available in such shaded environments was closer to the presumed nutritional target balance of moose. Our results illustrate that management decisions influence the macronutrient composition of understory shrubs in a way that may be important for herbivore foraging choices. We suggest that a larger variation in forest structure, both within and among stands across the landscape, will provide cervids with greater variation in forage qualities, since even small differences in forest structure can increase the nutritional variation of the forage. We discuss our results in the context of plant resource allocation, herbivore nutritional balancing and game and forest management.",
    "Enhanced Photon Extraction through Optimized Waveguide Geometry for Zincblende InAsP/InP Nanowire Quantum Dots Emitting in the Telecom Range.. Bucci G, Gzyl T, Musiał A, Zannier V, Beltram F, Rudno-Rudziński W, Sęk G, Sorba L (2026). InAs x P1-x quantum dots (QDs) embedded in InP nanowires (NWs) have recently emerged as a promising platform, offering good control over QD size, composition, and density through Au-catalyzed vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) growth. A unique advantage of this approach is the possibility of directly growing a waveguide around the QD, exploiting precise control of NW radial growth. Usually, InAs x P1-x NW-QDs are grown along the <111> direction with a wurtzite (WZ) crystal phase, where waveguides are typically realized using selective-area epitaxy combined with VLS (SAE-VLS), requiring preparation and prepatterning of the substrates. In the case of growth along the <100> direction, the growth of defect-free zincblende InAs x P1-x NW-QDs occurs at larger catalyst nanoparticle diameter compared to the WZ counterpart, with tunable emission over the telecom bands. Here, we show that in this system, efficient InP waveguides can be realized around the QDs without the need for SAE-VLS, solely by balancing axial and radial growth contributions during the NW growth. Employing the finite-difference time-domain simulations to optimize the NW-QD geometries allows us to experimentally investigate the interrelation between the growth parameters and the waveguide morphology. Microphotoluminescence measurements of the optimized structures confirm their improved emission properties and one order of magnitude enhanced QD emission intensity in the telecom range.",
    "Complete mitochondrial genome sequence of Dolichovespula kuami (Hymenoptera: Vespidae).. Pi BK, Choi MB, Ha YH, Kim CJ, Euo SS (2026). This study is part of an ongoing systematic research on the Korean Vespidae fauna. The complete mitochondrial genome of the social wasp D. kuami collected in South Korea was sequenced and annotated. The circular genome was 15,671 bp long and comprised 13 protein-coding genes, 22 transfer RNA genes, and two ribosomal RNA genes. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that D. kuami formed a monophyletic clade with other Dolichovespula species, indicating its distinctiveness despite being the sister group to D. flora. These findings confirm the taxonomic status of D. kuami and provide valuable genomic data for future phylogenetic studies of the Vespidae family.",
    "Characterization of a bZIP Transcription Factor ZipD in Aspergillus flavus.. Jeong DE, Cho HJ, Park HS (2026). Aspergillus flavus produces aflatoxin B1, a Group 1 carcinogen that causes severe economic and agricultural losses and can lead to invasive aspergillosis in humans. During its growth, A. flavus develops hyphae that form a continuous mycelium, which is associated with host colonization and toxin production. Transcription factors are considered regulators of fungal development and pathogenicity. Among these families, bZIP proteins are associated with growth, metabolism, and stress tolerance. In A. fumigatus, the bZIP transcription factor ZipD regulates calcium signaling pathways and cell wall integrity. However, the ortholog of zipD in A. flavus has not been characterized. To address this gap, we generated a deletion mutant and a complemented strain of zipD in A. flavus. The zipD deletion mutant showed reduced colony growth and conidia production, but increased sclerotia formation. The ΔzipD strain exhibited hypersensitivity to osmotic stress-related agents, cell wall stress-related agents, and high calcium concentrations. Additionally, ΔzipD showed reduced conidial colonization in pathogenicity assays using corn, soybean, and soybean brick compared to the wild-type strain. All of these phenotypes were restored in the complemented strain. These results suggest that zipD functions as a regulator of growth, developmental processes, and pathogenic traits in A. flavus.",
    "Welfare assessment of turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo gallopavo) on farm.. EFSA Panel Animal Health and Animal Welfare (AHAW), Nielsen SS, Alvarez J, Boklund A, Dippel S, Dorea F, Figuerola J, Herskin MS, Michel V, Miranda Chueca MA, Nannoni E, Nonno R, Stahl K, Berk J, Marchewka J, van Staaveren N, Balmos OM, Fabris C, Mosbach-Schulz O, Van der Stede Y, Vitali M, Rojo Gimeno C, Velarde A, Riber AB (2026). This Scientific Opinion assesses the welfare of turkeys of all ages (Meleagris gallopavo gallopavo) on farm in relation to the type and condition of the litter, type and availability of enrichment (including covered veranda and outdoor range), space allowance, concentrations of ammonia and carbon dioxide, effective environmental temperature, group size, nest conditions, lighting conditions and hatchery conditions, by using 19 welfare consequences and associated animal-based measures (ABMs) for their assessment. In addition, the risks posed by the practices of flock thinning and removal of hens, mutilations (i.e. beak trimming, desnooding and toe trimming), artificial insemination (including semen collection) and feed restriction are assessed, with the latter two practices only in turkey breeders. The welfare consequences of breeding is assessed. Recommendations to prevent and/or mitigate relevant welfare consequences in fattening and breeder turkeys include increasing space allowance compared to the currently provided space, avoiding feed and water deprivation of newly-hatched poults for more than 48 h, and providing enrichment such as elevated platforms, straw-bales and a covered veranda. It is recommended to maintain dry litter conditions, i.e. below a threshold of 35%-40% humidity. Beak trimming, desnooding and toe trimming as well as the associated welfare consequences can be avoided if the recommended housing and management practices are implemented, e.g. increasing space allowance and providing suitable enrichment. It is recommended to discontinue flock thinning and avoid quantitative feed restriction, the latter currently practised in breeder toms. Also, it is recommended to place more emphasis on leg health and less on weight gain in genetic selection. The selected ABMs to monitor relevant welfare consequences at the slaughterhouse are total mortality, plumage damage, carcass condemnation, wounds, breast blisters and footpad dermatitis.",
    "The complete mitochondrial genome of Apis cerana-southern China (Hymenoptera: Apidae) and insights into the phylogenetics.. Ding X, Yu X, Chen J, Su R, Li J (2025). The mitochondrial genome provides crucial information for understanding the evolution and phylogeny of various Apis cerana populations. Apis cerana-Southern China is a unique ecological type of Asian bee, A. cerana, primarily found in the coastal mountains of South China. Here, we used PacBio-HiFi sequencing to obtain the complete mitochondrial genome of A. cerana-Southern China and infer the phylogenetic relationships between A. cerana-Southern China and other A. cerana ecotypes. The mitochondrial genome of A. cerana-Southern China contains 16,137 bp and includes 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 22 tRNA genes, 2 rRNA genes, and an AT-rich region. The overall base composition is as follows: A (42.41%), C (9.59%), G (6.18%), and T (41.82%). The combined percentage of A and T (84.23%) is significantly higher than that of G and C. Among the 37 genes, 23 were located on the majority strand, while the remaining 14 were located on the minority strand. The phylogenetic tree based on the 13 PCGs showed that the genetic distance between A. cerana-Southern China, A. cerana-Central China, and A. cerana-Aba was closer. The complete mitochondrial genome sequence reported here would be useful for further phylogenetic analysis and conservation genetic studies in A. cerana-Southern China.",
    "State-Dependent and Social Modulation of Circulating Glucocorticoids in a Nomadic Songbird, the Red Crossbill (Loxia Curvirostra).. Vernasco BJ, Moore IT, Cornelius JM, Watts HE (2026). Glucocorticoids facilitate the integration of environmental information and coordination of organismal responses to perturbations. Circulating glucocorticoids are hypothesized to depend on an individual's environment and condition (i.e., state) to facilitate surviving challenges while minimizing fitness costs. Studies specifically focused on sources of individual variation in circulating glucocorticoids are critical to understanding state-dependent modulation of glucocorticoids and integrated phenotypes more broadly. Such studies can also provide insight into the evolution and adaptive significance of circulating glucocorticoids. Here, we repeatedly sample individuals before and during food restriction to identify how and when food availability and intrinsic differences (i.e., body condition and telomere length), including those of social partners, covary with glucocorticoids in captive Red Crossbills (Loxia curvirostra), a nomadic songbird that specializes on foraging for conifer seeds. Conifer seeds are ephemeral resources produced during unpredictable, but locally synchronous, masting events. Fluctuating food availability and social cues, change the behavior and glucocorticoid physiology of Red Crossbills. Pairs consisting of an adult and juvenile were food restricted using an environmental manipulation known to induce socially mediated changes in glucocorticoid signaling. Baseline and stress-induced glucocorticoids were measured before and during food restriction. Amongst adults, stress-induced glucocorticoids declined following food restriction and positively covaried with telomere length, independent of food availability. These results support the hypothesis that the acute glucocorticoid response is adaptively modulated based on environmental conditions and individual differences in state as measured by telomere length. Under food restriction, juvenile baseline glucocorticoids negatively covaried with body condition and the telomere lengths of adult social partners. The covariation between adult telomere lengths and juvenile baseline glucocorticoids suggests that telomere lengths of adults may relate to adult phenotypes, a hypothesis supported by the covariation between adult telomeres and stress-induced glucocorticoids. Further, as patterns were absent before food restriction, our results demonstrate how environmental challenges can reveal the importance of intrinsic differences to organismal responses and social cues. This study leverages a non-model organism experiencing an ecologically relevant environmental challenge to exemplify how intrinsic differences, including those of social partners, can modulate an endocrine mediator of organismal responses to environmental perturbations.",
    "Environmental enrichment as a mitochondria-targeting systems strategy across neurodegenerative diseases and retinal dystrophies.. Rusciano D, Gagliano C, Avitabile A, Maya-Vetencourt JF (2026). Mitochondrial dysfunction is a central contributor to neurodegenerative disorders affecting both the central nervous system and the retina, where impaired energy metabolism, oxidative stress, and defective cellular resilience converge to drive progressive neuronal loss. Environmental enrichment (EE), a multimodal non-pharmacological paradigm, has emerged as a powerful modulator of brain and retinal plasticity in preclinical models, promoting adaptive responses that support mitochondrial function and neurotrophic signaling. This review synthesizes evidence indicating that EE influences mitochondrial quality control, redox homeostasis, synaptic resilience, and neuroimmune balance across a range of experimental models of neurodegeneration and retinal dystrophy. While these effects converge on shared downstream pathways, important disease-, cell-type-, and context-specific differences exist, and mechanistic generalization across systems requires caution. Human studies remain limited, heterogeneous, and often focused on functional outcomes rather than direct biological endpoints, resulting in modest and variable effect sizes. Rather than proposing EE as a stand-alone therapy, we frame it as a system-level, disease-modifying context that may enhance endogenous protective capacity and potentially complement pharmacological, genetic, or rehabilitative interventions, pending disease-specific validation. Forward-looking perspectives, including digitally mediated and AI-supported EE-inspired approaches, are discussed as conceptual strategies whose biological relevance will depend on future studies integrating functional outcomes with validated molecular and metabolic biomarkers. Together, the available evidence positions EE as a biologically grounded, non-invasive framework for promoting neuro- and retino-protective resilience, while underscoring the need for rigorously designed translational and clinical studies to define its therapeutic boundaries and mechanisms of action.",
    "DSN1 drives breast cancer progression via cell cycle regulation: diagnostic and therapeutic implications.. Liu D, Luis MA, Sherilyn H G D, Zhu X, Zhang X, Fang Y, Lin X, Tang S, Cai F (2025). AIM: Breast cancer is the most prevalent form of cancer among females and carries a substantial societal impact. DSN1, a component of the MIS12 complex, plays a critical role in centromere assembly, distribution, and stability. While DSN1's role in tumors has been investigated, its specific function in breast cancer remains unclear. METHODS: First, we utilized bioinformatics techniques to explore DSN1 expression in breast cancer and conducted functional enrichment and correlation analyses. Subsequently, we assessed the clinical relevance of DSN1 through immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, we examined how DSN1 affects the growth of breast cancer cells by conducting CCK8 and colony formation tests. Cell cycle and apoptosis changes were assessed using flow cytometry. Moreover, we examined key genes related to cell cycle and apoptosis to further elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Finally, we screened potential drugs targeting DSN1 by drug sensitivity and molecular docking analyses. RESULTS: Bioinformatics analysis revealed that DSN1 is highly expressed in breast cancer, making it a potential diagnostic marker. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that the DSN1- overexpressed group was enriched in cell proliferation-related pathways. Cellular experiments confirmed that DSN1 promotes breast cancer proliferation by affecting cell cycle pathways, involving key molecules such as CCNB1, CCND1, CKD1, CDK4, and CDK6. Drug sensitivity analysis showed that the DSN1 high expression group was resistant to drugs such as Epirubicin, Cyclophosphamide, Ribociclib, and Palbociclib, but relatively sensitive to tamoxifen and lapatinib. CONCLUSIONS: DSN1 contributes to breast cancer progression by modulating cell cycle pathways, making it a potential diagnostic and therapeutic target with clinical applicability.",
    "Potential Distribution of Linepithema humile (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) in South Korea: An Ensemble Species Distribution Modeling Approach.. Namgung H, Kim H (2026). Linepithema humile is a well-known invasive alien species that was first detected in 2019 at the cargo handling area of Busan Station in South Korea and has since established a population near the discovery site. Despite sufficient time for potential spread, no additional occurrence records have been reported outside the initial detection site. To predict its potential distribution across South Korea, we constructed species distribution models (SDMs) using occurrence data from its native range in South America and invasive range in North America. Modeling was conducted with the BIOMOD2 platform using five algorithms (ANN, GBM, MARS, MAXENT, and RF) and six environmental variables (Bio03, Bio04, Bio13, Bio16, Bio18, and the mean annual cumulative soil temperature degree-days above 15.9°C). Model performance was evaluated with Kappa, ROC, and TSS, and only models meeting thresholds (Kappa ≥ 0.7, ROC ≥ 0.7, and TSS ≥ 0.5) were used for ensemble modeling via EMmean, EMwmean, and EMca methods. Projection accuracy was assessed using chi-square tests based on occurrence data not used in model training. The predicted potential distribution included southern and southwestern coastal areas, which was consistent with the record in Busan. This study demonstrates the utility of SDMs trained on occurrence data from outside Korea in predicting the potential distribution of L. humile with limited domestic records and highlights high-risk areas beyond Busan. Such approaches may support early detection and management strategies in the initial stages of biological invasion.",
    "Diversity and Pathogenicity of Fungi Associated with Dieback and Trunk Cankers in Pecan Orchards of Sonora, Mexico.. Torres-Valenzuela KB, Rangel-Montoya EA, Valenzuela-Solano C, Hernandez-Martinez R (2026). Pecan (Carya illinoensis) is a major economic crop in Mexico. The states of Chihuahua and Sonora contribute approximately 80% to the national production. Recently, symptoms of trunk diseases, including necrotic lesions in the xylem, cankers, dieback, and shoot blights, have been observed in pecan orchards in Sonora. This study aimed to determine the presence and identity of fungi responsible for these symptoms. A survey was conducted between 2021 and 2022 in eleven orchards near Hermosillo, Sonora. Fungi were isolated from necrotic tissue on PDA medium, yielding around 150 isolates. Based on colony morphology, 50 isolates were selected for molecular characterization using the translation elongation factor 1 alpha (tef1-α) gene, the nuclear ribosomal DNA-internal transcribed spacer (ITS), and, for some isolates, the β-tubulin gene. The fungi identified included Pseudofusicoccum stromaticum, Lasiodiplodia exigua, L. brasiliensis, Diaporthe caatingaensis, Eutypellla microtheca, and several Fusarium spp. The optimal growth temperature for most isolates was 30°C, with none exhibited growth at 40°C, although some Lasiodiplodia and Pseudofusicoccum isolates showed limited growth at 37°C. Following pathogenicity studies, the Lasiodiplodia species produced the largest lesions on pecan cv. Wichita, followed by P. stromaticum, while D. caatingaensis and E. microtheca exhibited intermediate virulence. The least virulent were D. caatingaensis and Fusarium spp. isolates. This study contributes to understanding the phytosanitary status of pecan orchards in Mexico and lays the groundwork for developing management strategies to control these fungi.",

    "Optimisation of the parasitism rate of Diachasmimorpha longicaudata (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) in Ceratitis capitata (Diptera: Tephritidae).. Amaral MCA, Dos Santos ZC, Castellani MA, Pérez-Maluf R, Alvarenga CD, Da Costa DR, Dos Santos MM, Leite SA, Moreira AA (2026). Fruit flies are the most serious problem in fruit production worldwide, causing severe losses in production and fruit quality. The use of parasitoids, especially Diachasmimorpha longicaudata (Ashmead) (Hymenoptera, Braconidae), is an important tool for suppressing the fruit fly population. The objectives of this study were to determine the exposure time, density, and ideal larval instar of Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann) (Diptera: Tephritidae) and to verify whether the parasitoid's previous experience affects its interaction with the host insect and the influence of these factors on the parasitism rate. In three bioassays, fly larvae were placed in 'parasitism units' to test different methods of exposure to female parasitoids. The variables included the previous experience of the female parasitoid with oviposition, the exposure time (30, 60, 120, 240, and 480 min) of the larvae to the parasitoid and the number (5, 10, 15, and 20) and instar (second and third) of the fly larvae. The flies and parasitoids that emerged were quantified, and the parasitism rate and sex ratio of the parasitoids were calculated. The results of the present study indicate that to increase the parasitism rate of D. longicaudata, third-instar larvae of C. capitata must be grouped into parasitism units of 20 larvae and exposed to a single female of the parasitoid for 8 h.",
    "Mosquito direct skin feeding bioassay: 15 years of experience and a standardised approach in Mali.. Sylla D, Hume JCC, Goodman H, Sacko A, Kwan JL, Fofana A, Maiga MHA, Katile A, Doucoure M', Kone M, Coulibaly B, Guindo A, Diallo M, Doumbia M, Kone SM, Zeguime A, Goita S, Sidibe M, Sidibe S, Dembele Y, Sissoko K, Djiguiba B, Sankare S, Diarra SDK, Poudiougo OA, Traore B, Diarra Y, Sylla L, Tembely B, Traore AS, Kamate B, Baber I, Imeru A, Higbee E, Muratova O, Omaswa F, Wu Y, Yaro AS, Healy SA, Sagara I, Traore CS, Doumbo OK, Coulibaly MB, Duffy PE (2026). BACKGROUND: New malaria control tools are urgently needed. Transmission-blocking vaccines (TBVs) target sexual parasite stages in mosquitoes to prevent disease spread. TBV testing requires specialised mosquito transmission assays, such as the Direct Skin Feeding (DSF) bioassay. DSF is a xenodiagnostic tool that mimics parasite transmission to mosquitoes as it naturally occurs but has not previously been scaled up nor standardised for use in clinical trials. METHODS: DSF bioassays were performed on large cohorts of participants, including children five years and older, during observational and interventional studies conducted over a 15-year period at sites around Bamako, Mali. Human, mosquito and parasite parameters were monitored to assess DSF safety and acceptability, vector performance, and individual- and population-level transmission dynamics. Standardised procedures developed for DSF included mosquito colony maintenance, mosquito preparation for DSF, feeding procedures, quality control metrics, ethical approaches and volunteer follow-up. RESULTS: From 2011 through 2025, 37,984 DSF bioassays were performed on 2,796 rural study participants aged 5 years and older, at two Mali study sites. DSFs were well-accepted and safe, with a low refusal rate (0.8% of subjects in vaccine studies) and rare adverse events (AE) that met grading criteria (11 subjects; 0.032%). The few immediate and short-term skin reactions that met AE grading criteria were mild or moderate in severity, all resolving within 48 h. DSF infrastructure was progressively scaled up to a capacity of 120 assays per day requiring 36,000 female mosquitoes per week. Rates of DSF positivity were highest in studies where feeds were conducted on individuals with known Plasmodium falciparum parasitaemia (average 18.4%) vs studies where feeds were conducted on all participants irrespective of blood smear status (average 1.6%). CONCLUSIONS: The DSF bioassay is a xenodiagnostic tool to detect transmissible malaria parasites, and a scalable and safe method for evaluating TBV efficacy. DSF offers several advantages including close mimicry of naturally occurring transmission, simplicity of performance and standardisation, and scalable throughput to support late-stage vaccine trials. While parasite transmission rates measured by DSF were low overall at study sites in Mali, sufficient transmission endpoints are generated to assess efficacy of interventions that interrupt transmission, supporting the DSF bioassay as a surrogate efficacy endpoint for TBV studies.",
    "Non-technical skill performance during remote, international, augmented-reality neonatal resuscitation protocol simulations: a feasibility study.. Rojas M, Yun R, Rama A, Plane J, Arancibia C, Paredes P, Penna A, Zhao Y, Caruso TJ (2026). BACKGROUND: Neonatal resuscitation requires mastery of technical and non-technical skills (NTS). The Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) emphasizes ventilation, along with effective leadership, teamwork, and situational awareness. Simulation-based education is central to NTS training but is resource-intensive with limited access in low- and middle-income countries. Augmented reality (AR) medical simulations offer a scalable, remote solution with fewer logistical barriers. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, single-arm feasibility study evaluating a remote AR medical simulation for assessing NTS during neonatal resuscitation. Instructors based in Northern California (Stanford School of Medicine) remotely facilitated pediatric and anesthesiology residents in Santiago, Chile (University of Chile) as team leaders in an NRP scenario delivered using an AR medical simulator. The primary outcome was NTS performance measured with the Anesthetists' Non-Technical Skills (ANTS) tool. Secondary outcomes included the Behaviorally Anchored Rating Scale (BARS), system usability via the System Usability Scale (SUS), and ergonomics via the ISO 9241 - 400 scale. RESULTS: Thirty-four residents completed all sessions. Participants demonstrated adequate NTS performance, with ANTS scores 2.5-2.9 (scale 1-4) and BARS scores 5.2-5.4 (scale 1-9), similar to those observed in traditional, in-person simulations. SUS responses indicated high usability, and ergonomic results suggested minimal physical or cognitive burden. CONCLUSIONS: This feasibility study shows that participants demonstrated measurable NTS performance during remote, international AR neonatal resuscitation simulations, as assessed using ANTS and BARS.",
    "ISG15-driven immune modulation and tumor progression in breast cancer metastasis: insights from single-cell and spatial transcriptomics.. Shao H, Tang H, Lin H, Xu Y (2026). BACKGROUND: Cancer stem cells (CSCs) play a crucial role in breast cancer (BRCA) progression and lymph node metastasis. This study aimed to elucidate how CSCs reshape the immune microenvironment during metastatic dissemination, with a particular focus on macrophage and T-cell regulation. METHODS: A mouse orthotopic BRCA model was established to obtain primary tumor (BRCA_PT) and lymph node metastatic (BRCA_LNMT) tissues. Single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics were used to characterize cellular heterogeneity, marker genes, and intercellular communication. TCGA-BRCA data were analyzed for differential expression, functional enrichment, and immune cell infiltration. In vitro, 4T1-S CSCs were used to assess self-renewal, migration/invasion, ISG15-mediated signaling, and interactions with macrophages and T cells. ELISA, western blotting, sphere formation, colony formation, CCK-8, Transwell, luciferase reporter assays, and ChIP were performed. In vivo, subcutaneous and orthotopic mouse models were used to evaluate the effect of ISG15 on tumor growth and lymph node metastasis. RESULTS: Bioinformatic analyses revealed an elevated proportion of CSCs in BRCA_LNMT, where CSCs likely induced M2 macrophage polarization through TAM-mediated communication. ISG15 was highly expressed in metastatic tumors and associated with M2 polarization and reduced T-cell activation. In vitro, ISG15 enhanced CSC self-renewal and invasiveness, promoted IL-10-mediated M2 polarization, and upregulated PD-L1 via JAK-STAT signaling to suppress T-cell activity. In vivo, ISG15 silencing significantly inhibited tumor growth and lymph node metastasis. CONCLUSION: ISG15 in BRCA CSCs promotes lymph node metastasis by driving M2 macrophage polarization and suppressing T-cell activation, highlighting a critical role for ISG15-mediated immunomodulation and a potential therapeutic target.",
    "USP7 protects histone H1.2 from proteasome-mediated degradation to facilitate DNA repair and pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms progression.. Ye M, Xu L, Yu P, Pan J, Shi X, Xue B, He N, Hu P, Liu M, Lu X, Xu Y, Xu Y, Tang Q (2026). Ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7), a deubiquitinase, is involved in tumor progression. However, its roles in pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (pNENs) remain unclear. The main objective of this study was therefore to investigate the molecular mechanism of how USP7 promoted pNEN progression. Proteomics and ubiquitin-omics were used to identify the substrates for USP7. We investigated the roles of USP7 and histone H1.2 in DNA repair in pNEN cells using comet assays and γ-H2AX immunofluorescence. The synergistic effects of cisplatin and the USP7 inhibitor, P005091, were evaluated using CCK-8, colony formation, and EdU assays. Western blot analysis was conducted to characterize the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. In vivo, the efficacy of the combination therapy was tested in xenograft models. The results showed a significant increase in USP7 levels in the tissues and cells of pNENs. Furthermore, USP7 was found to promote the proliferation, migration, and invasion of pNENs both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, USP7 facilitated DNA repair through its interaction with histone H1.2 and the activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. The combination of cisplatin and P005091, a USP7 inhibitor, synergistically inhibited tumor growth and DNA repair in both in vitro and in vivo models, without exhibiting significant toxicity. In conclusion, USP7 was a key regulator of DNA repair in pNENs. The combination of cisplatin and P005091 therefore holds promise as a therapeutic strategy for pNENs.",
    "Temperature-driven shifts in foraging behaviour during larval development in a dragonfly.. Hogreve J, Johansson F, Suhling F (2026). Predatory performance of dragonfly larvae is influenced by a multifaceted interplay of external factors such as temperature, prey density and interspecific competition, and life history traits like age and size. We investigated the relative impact of these factors and traits on the prey-capture behaviour of Sympetrum striolatum larvae i.e., the number of strikes, captures and capture success. The larvae were observed three times over a five-week period under a combination of three temperature levels, two prey densities, and with or without a conspecific competitor. To access the ontogenetic effects on foraging behaviour the larvae were reared from hatching and their size measured before each trial. Higher temperature, particularly for young and small larvae, and prey density significantly increased prey-capture behaviour. The life history traits strongly affected strikes, captures, and capture success and these effects were stronger than the external factor prey density or competition. These results underscore the crucial role of ontogeny on foraging performance. Future studies and predictive models of foraging behaviour should incorporate life history to better understand foraging dynamics. Our study highlights the importance of integrating developmental biology into understanding behaviour under environmental change, rather than focusing solely on external variables.",
    "SRP54-related congenital neutropenia: a multidisciplinary effort.. Borg Azzopardi D, Vella A, Ceci Bonello E, Farrugia D, Gerada E, Gatt A (2026). A previously healthy Caucasian man in his 30s presented with a 9-week history of productive cough, fever and dyspnoea, initially treated as pneumonia with transient improvement. Examination revealed coarse right-sided crepitations and finger clubbing. Laboratory testing demonstrated persistent severe neutropenia and elevated inflammatory markers, while imaging showed persistent right middle lobe consolidation. Further history revealed recurrent respiratory infections, diarrhoea and poor dentition since childhood, with medical records showing possible neutrophil migration defect. The patient received 6 weeks of broad-spectrum antibiotics and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, resulting in resolution of consolidation and modest neutrophil recovery. Acquired causes of immunosuppression were excluded through microbiological and immunological workup. Stool testing confirmed pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. Genetic testing identified a pathogenic heterozygous signal recognition particle-54 mutation, consistent with Shwachman Diamond-like syndrome. Given the risk of leukaemic transformation, the patient was referred for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. This case underscores the need for a multidisciplinary approach to manage rare neutropenic syndromes.",
    "Helminths in Magellanic Penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus) Nest Soil in One of the Southernmost Breeding Colonies at Martillo Island, Tierra del Fuego, Argentina.. Montangero M, Harris S, Martín AS (2026). This study provides the first record of helminth prevalence associated with Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) at the southernmost limit of their distribution, in the Beagle Channel, Argentina. Using a noninvasive and indirect nest soil sampling approach, we detected multiple helminth morphotypes, including nematodes, cestodes, trematodes, and acanthocephalans. Nematodes were the most frequently encountered group. Helminth load was greater during chick rearing than in the postbreeding period, likely due to increased fecal deposition and favorable environmental conditions. Parasite occurrence also varied across colony erosion zones shaped by penguin activity and natural processes, suggesting that microhabitat characteristics influence helminth persistence. These findings underscore the utility of soil sampling for monitoring temporal patterns of parasite exposure, particularly in remote wildlife populations, highlighting the need for continued surveillance of penguin health. Future research integrating direct parasitological and molecular techniques will improve taxonomic resolution and advance the understanding of parasite transmission dynamics.",
    "Organ-specific in vitro models for prediction of hazard assessment of nanomaterials.. Camassa LMA, Elje E, Shaposhnikov S, Anmarkrud KH, Skaare Ø, Espevik T, Nilsen AM, Ryan L, Rundén-Pran E, Zienolddiny-Narui S (2026). Organ-specific multicellular in vitro models are used to mimic the lung-blood-brain axis, and to assess the nanomaterials (NMs) safety in humans. We employed a triculture lung model, a whole-blood model, an astrocytes-neurons coculture to examine health outcomes by three cerium dioxide (CeO2) NMs and silver (Ag) nanowires. Endpoints included cytotoxicity, gene expression, genotoxicity, inflammatory markers at the air-liquid interface (ALI), complement activation, and secondary toxicity in astrocytes-neurons coculture. Post-exposure, CeO2-3.5 nm high-dose decreased cell viability, no DNA damage was detected. At epithelial-macrophages interface, CeO2-50 nm upregulated surfactant protein A (SPA), cell surface death receptor (FAS), and heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1), whereas CeO2-3.5 nm downregulated SPA. Ag-nanowires upregulated HMOX1, macrophage inflammatory protein-1β (MIP-1β), granulocyte colony-stimulator factor (G-CSF), chemokine C-X-C-motif ligand 1 (CXCL1). At endothelial side, CeO2-50 nm and - 3.5 nm, and Ag-nanowires upregulated HMOX1. In whole-blood model, CeO2-3.5 nm high-dose reduced terminal complement complex (TCC) proteins, while CeO2-50 nm and Ag-nanowires increased them. Nanomaterials activated CD11b+ on granulocytes and monocytes. Ag-nanowires conditioned-medium (CM) on astrocytes-neurons coculture, decreased cell viability. CeO2-50 nm CM upregulated IL1β, NFκB, and HMOX1. Overall, CeO₂-3.5 nm exhibits lung toxicity; CeO₂-50 nm CM triggers inflammatory response and Ag-nanowires CM may induce cytotoxicity in brain cells.",
    "Deep learning predicts and in vitro experiments validates the synergistic anti-liver cancer effect of vincristine and lenvatinib: Mechanism involving apoptosis induction via the TNF-α/Caspase-8 pathway.. Wang W, Zhao Y, Li M, Wei M, Wu L, Wei J (2026). Resistance to lenvatinib has become a major obstacle in the clinical treatment of liver cancer, highlighting the significant research value and translational potential of developing synergistic drug combinations. In this study, deep learning models (MARSY and MatchMaker) were employed to predict potential synergistic partners for lenvatinib, with vincristine identified as a promising candidate. In vitro experiments confirmed that the combination synergistically inhibited the proliferation, migration, and clonogenic formation of liver cancer cells: CCK-8 and colony formation assays demonstrated a significant reduction in cell viability and clonogenic ability, while wound healing and Transwell assays indicated effective suppression of cell migration. The synergistic effect was quantitatively validated using the ZIP model. Furthermore, flow cytometry and Western blot analyses confirmed that the combination effectively induced apoptosis. Mechanistic studies revealed that the co-treatment led to excessive accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), which activated the TNF-α/Caspase-8 signaling pathway, thereby inducing apoptosis in liver cancer cells. The cytotoxicity and pro-apoptotic effects were significantly attenuated by the ROS scavenger NAC. These findings provide a solid preclinical foundation for the further development of this combination therapy and underscore the importance of the \"computational prediction-mechanistic validation\" strategy in advancing cancer drug discovery.",
    "Nurturing care for early childhood sleep interventions with tailored care: the NEST Approach.. Boran P, DelRosso LM (2026). Early childhood insomnia (ECI) affects 20-30 % of children aged 6-36 months, making it the most common sleep disturbance in this age group. Current interventions often focus on independent sleep through extinction-based behavioral methods, with less emphasis on broader socioecological influences such as caregiving quality and feeding practices. This paper introduces a conceptual model to reframe ECI interventions using the World Health Organization endorsed Nurturing care framework (NCF), which includes five components: good health, adequate nutrition, safety and security, responsive caregiving and opportunities for learning. Sleep is essential for health, and early childhood represent a critical window for shaping lifelong sleep patterns. Breastfeeding helps integration of all five components while responsive caregiving, supports the other four components. Sensory-motor nourishment fosters a sense of safety and early learning opportunities promote self-regulation. The model outlines actionable strategies under each NCF components, offering guidance for researchers and supporting adaptation across diverse settings, viewing sleep health as part of a broader caregiver ecosystem rather than isolated behavioral problem.",
    "Beaked whale dive behavior and acoustic detection range off Louisiana using three-dimensional acoustic tracking.. Frouin-Mouy H, Frasier KE, Hildebrand JA, Snyder ER, Wiggins SM, Garrison LP, Soldevilla MS (2026). Understanding abundance and trends of beaked whales in the heavily industrialized Gulf of America (formerly Gulf of Mexico), is critical for management but challenging with visual-based distance-sampling due to their elusive surface behavior. Acoustic-based distance-sampling methods rely on accurate modeling of detection probability as a function of distance from a recorder, requiring population-specific diving and acoustic behavior parameters, which is currently lacking for Gulf populations. To address this, we used passive acoustic tracking with two 4-channel High-Frequency Acoustic Recording Packages (HARPs) deployed off Louisiana (~1100 m depth) in 2021. Echolocation clicks detected on both recorders were localized in 3D to characterize acoustic and diving behavior. These data informed a Monte Carlo cue-based simulation to estimate the probability of detection by a near-seafloor single-sensor HARP. A trial-based approach also estimated detection probability as a function of range to a single-channel sensor deployed at the site. Results show species-specific differences. Goose-beaked whales (Ziphius cavirostris), were detected for longer periods during foraging dives (n = 24 dives, mean: 20.5 min; range: 7-42) compared with Blainville's (Mesoplodon densirostris, n = 2 dives, 13.6 min; 11-16) and Gervais' (Mesoplodon europaeus, n = 24 dives, 12.7 min; 7-19) beaked whales. Maximum dive depths also differed, with some goose-beaked whales foraging at or near the seafloor. Descent and ascent rates were similar within species but differed among them (1.34/1.40 m/s for goose-beaked and 1.15/1.19 m/s for Gervais' beaked whales). Source level and broadband directivity index were estimated at 225 dBpp re 1 μPa-1m and 26 dB for goose-beaked whales, and 218 dBpp re 1 μPa-1m and 20 dB for Gervais' beaked whales. Estimates were not possible for Blainville's beaked whales due to limited data. In both the Monte Carlo simulation and trial-based approach, detection probability declined sharply with ranges, reflecting the highly directional beam of beaked whale echolocation clicks.",
    "Antibiofilm activity of three-dimensional bacterial nanocellulose scaffolds containing antimicrobial agents.. Kressin FK, Stahelin IA, Souza GDR Jr, Cesca K, Mazzon RR, Sabino-Silva R, Goulart TS, Teixeira CDS, Garcia LDFR, Almeida J (2026). Studies have focused on the use of alternative scaffolds for Regenerative Endodontic Procedures (REPs) because current materials still pose significant technical limitations. The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the antibiofilm activity of three-dimensional bacterial nanocellulose (BNC) scaffolds incorporated with 0.12% chlorhexidine digluconate (BNC/CHX), 1% amoxicillin (BNC/AMOX), and 1% clindamycin (BNC/CLI). BNC scaffolds without an antimicrobial agent composed the control group (BNC/C). BNC scaffolds were immersed in a multispecies culture of E. faecalis, A. naeslundii, and S. sanguinis, which served as a substrate for biofilm growth. After 24 hours, 7, and 15 days, the mean value of colony-forming units (CFUs) was determined. Multispecies biofilm formation on the BNC scaffolds was assessed under Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM). For the biofilm cell viability test, the mean value of CFU/mL for each sample was determined, and the data were normalized by taking the base-10 logarithm (log10) of each CFU/mL value. Data were analyzed by Two-way ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni's post-hoc multiple comparisons (α=5%). In the 24h period, BNC/AMOX demonstrated significantly lower CFUs mean values than BNC/CHX, BNC/CLI, and BNC/C (p<0.05). CFUs mean values increased throughout the experimental periods, with no significant difference compared to the other groups (p>0.05). SEM and CLSM analysis revealed, in the initial periods, a lower number of microorganisms in the experimental groups compared to the control group. BNC scaffolds containing 1% amoxicillin and 1% clindamycin demonstrated greater antimicrobial activity against a multispecies biofilm within the initial periods of incubation. Estudos têm investigado o uso de scaffolds alternativos para Procedimentos Endodônticos Regenerativos (PERs), uma vez que ainda existem limitações técnicas significativas nos materiais atualmente empregados. O objetivo deste estudo in vitro foi avaliar a atividade antibiofilme de scaffolds tridimensionais de nanocelulose bacteriana (BNC) incorporados com 0,12% de digluconato de clorexidina (BNC/CHX), 1% de amoxicilina (BNC/AMOX) e 1% de clindamicina (BNC/CLI). Scaffolds de BNC sem agente antimicrobiano compuseram o grupo controle (BNC/C). Os scaffolds de BNC foram imersos em uma cultura multiespécies de E. faecalis, A. naeslundii e S. sanguinis, servindo como substrato para o crescimento do biofilme. Após 24 horas, 7 e 15 dias, determinou-se o valor médio de unidades formadoras de colônia (UFCs). A formação de biofilme multiespécies nos scaffolds de BNC foi avaliada por Microscopia Eletrônica de Varredura (MEV) e por Microscopia Confocal de Varredura a Laser (CLSM). Para o teste de viabilidade celular do biofilme, o valor médio de UFC/mL de cada amostra foi determinado e os dados foram normalizados pela transformação logaritmo de base 10 (log₁₀) de cada valor de UFC/mL. Os dados foram analisados pelos testes de ANOVA de dois fatores, seguida do teste de comparações múltiplas post-hoc de Bonferroni (α=5%). No período de 24h, o BNC/AMOX apresentou valores médios de UFCs significativamente menores do que BNC/CHX, BNC/CLI e BNC/C (p<0,05). Os valores médios de UFCs aumentaram ao longo dos períodos experimentais, sem diferença significativa em relação aos demais grupos (p>0,05). A análise por MEV e CLSM revelou, nos períodos iniciais, um número menor de microrganismos nos grupos experimentais em comparação ao grupo controle. Scaffolds de BNC contendo 1% de amoxicilina e 1% de clindamicina demonstraram maior atividade antimicrobiana contra o biofilme multiespécies nos períodos iniciais de incubação.",
    "Isolation and characterization of actinobacteria of the genus Streptomyces under salt stress conditions.. Kadirova G, Akhmedova Z, Shonakhunov T, Khusanov T, Ibragimov A (2026). This study presents a comprehensive characterization of actinobacteria isolated from soils subjected to both anthropogenic pollution and secondary salinization. As a result of microbiological screening, two promising strains were selected - Streptomyces violaceorubidus strain N3 and Streptomyces rochei strain N4 - which demonstrated high salt tolerance, active colony and biomass formation, and pronounced antagonistic activity against several phytopathogenic fungi. Molecular genetic identification based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing, followed by phylogenetic analysis, confirmed the taxonomic affiliation of the isolates. Experimental data showed that both strains produce the phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), exopolysaccharides (EPS), and the enzyme ACC deaminase, both under normal conditions and under salt stress (300 mM NaCl). Under saline conditions, an increase was observed in IAA production (by 31-34%), EPS synthesis (by 39-47%), and ACC deaminase activity (up to 42.8 nmol α-ketobutyrate/mg protein/h). The revealed physiological and biochemical traits suggest that S. violaceorubidus N3 and S. rochei N4 have high potential as microbial inoculants for enhancing plant resistance to abiotic (salt stress) and biotic (phytopathogens) environmental factors.",
    "Chlorhexidine is Superior to Ozonized Water in the Reduction of the Oral Cavity Microbiota of Horses.. Fernandes MD, Ribeiro GSN, Joaquim JGF, Ferraz SM, Fonteque JH (2026). In equine husbandry, oral cavity procedures are commonly performed and may be associated with complications, including extraoral diseases, potentially resulting from bacterial contamination and inadequate antisepsis. Bacterial resistance to antimicrobials is a major issue for healthcare professionals, including veterinarians that may misuse these pharmaceuticals. Therefore, developing novel methods for antisepsis is desirable. This study aims to test the effectiveness of a 100 µg/ml ozonized injectable water solution versus 0.12% chlorhexidine mouthwash. Fifty adult equines had swab samples collected from their oral cavities, to make cultures and isolate the main microorganisms present. Half of the animals then had their mouths washed with 0.12% chlorhexidine and the other half were treated with the 100 µg/ml ozonized solution mouthwash. Following these treatments, another swab sample was obtained from each animal, and the culture repeated. The number of colony-forming units (CFUs) and the number of times a microbe genus was present were counted. The genera isolated were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Klebsiella, Escherichia, Streptococcus, and Pseudomonas, as well as yeast cells. The first 3 were the most prevalent, present in over 70% of the animals. The authors concluded that in healthy horses, a single mouth rinse with a 100 µg/ml ozonized solution was less effective than 0.12% chlorhexidine for reducing CFU count and presence. This study confirmed the known efficacy of chlorhexidine and its superiority to ozonized water. It also highlighted the importance of performing procedures antiseptically.",
    "Insecticidal and repellent activity of cinnamic acid derivatives: investigating alternative products to control imported fire ants (Formicidae: Hymenoptera).. Shah FM, Khan IA, Ali A (2026). Trans-cinnamic acid and its derivatives were investigated against Solenopsis invicta Buren (RIFA), Solenopsis richteri Forel (BIFA), and reproductively functional hybrid (HIFA) for their repellency and toxicity. A range of serial concentrations starting from 156 µg/g to the failure of treatments were evaluated. Removal of treated sand in a digging bioassay was used as the criterion for repellency. Treatments were considered active until the removal of treated sand became similar to that in the ethanol control. Based on sand removal, trans-cinnamic acid, benzyl cinnamate and phenethyl cinnamate failed at 156 µg/g, whereas isoamyl cinnamate was active at 19.5, 19.5, and 39 µg/g against RIFA, HIFA, and BIFA workers, respectively. Isopropyl cinnamate and η-butyl cinnamate were active at 19.5, 39, and 39 µg/g against RIFA, HIFA, and BIFA workers, and ethyl cinnamate at 9.8, 19.5, and 39 µg/g against HIFA, RIFA, and BIFA, respectively. DEET failed at 31.25, 62.5, and 15.6 µg/g against RIFA, BIFA, and HIFA, respectively. Ethyl cinnamate, with LC50 value of 54.8, 60.9, and 70.4 µg/g showed toxicity, followed by isopropyl cinnamate (LC50 = 71.1, 69.3, and 74.7 µg/g), η-butyl cinnamate (LC50 = 128.2, 86.1, and 134.2 µg/g) and isoamyl cinnamate (LC50 = 95.8, 142.1, and 139.2 µg/g) against RIFA, BIFA, and HIFA workers, respectively. Fipronil was more toxic with LC50s of 0.43, 0.33, and 0.51 µg/g against RIFA, BIFA, and HIFA workers, respectively. Trans-cinnamic acid, benzyl cinnamate, and phenethyl cinnamate did not cause any mortality at 156 µg/g. In residual bioassays, isoamyl and η-butyl cinnamate at 312 μg/g suppressed the digging activity for more than 3 wk. Different formulations of active cinnamates be further evaluated under field conditions.",
    "Latitude and communal living are associated with the evolution of joint territory defense in New World songbirds.. Arashanapalli S, Freeman BG (2026). There is great variation across species in how many individuals participate in territorial defense. Here, we test the hypotheses that joint territorial defense by pairs or family groups is more common in songbird species that (1) nest in tropical latitudes, (2) exhibit weak sexual selection, (3) maintain long-term social bonds, (4) defend year-round territories, (5) nest cooperatively, and (6) are sedentary. We conducted the first broad-scale test of these hypotheses by performing 3177 playback experiments across the Americas to measure territorial defense behaviors for 264 species. We found support for three of our six predictions: tropical species, cooperative nesters, and species with long-term social bonds are indeed more likely to jointly defend territories, but other variables were unrelated to joint territorial defense. Latitudinal zone was the strongest predictor, suggesting that tropical environments select for joint territory defense above and beyond the life history traits we included in our analysis. The remaining traits that predicted territorial defense describe aspects of communal living, though the association with long-term social bonds was marginal. Overall, we document a strong latitudinal gradient wherein joint territorial defense is consistently more common in the tropics even when accounting for different life history traits of tropical birds.",
    "Enhanced Proliferation and Activation of Natural Killer Cells by Deer Antler Velvet Extract, YC-1101, and Its Synergistic Antitumor Effects in CT26 Syngeneic Mouse Model.. Lee JY, Lee J, Yeon D, Yoon JS, Hwang SH, Baek SH, Park KH, Song A, Jeong J, Seo JW, Kang J, Park HJ (2026). Deer antler velvet (Cervus elaphus L.) is a traditional material in oriental medicine, extensively utilized for its anti-aging, antioxidant, and immune-boosting properties. Our prior research revealed that enzyme-derived deer antler velvet extract (YC-1101) stimulated the immune system by activating macrophages and augmenting splenocyte proliferation. In this study, we investigated the effect of YC-1101 on the proliferation, activation, and cytotoxicity of natural killer (NK) cells, emphasizing activation-receptor upregulation, cytokine secretion, and antitumor efficacy. Our findings demonstrated that YC-1101 treatment markedly enhanced NK cell proliferation in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner by preserving mitochondrial function. NK cells expanded through YC-1101 treatment exhibited a significant increase in surface expression of activating NK receptors, NKG2D, and NKp44. Additionally, levels of immune-related cytokines like tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor were substantially elevated in the YC-1101-treated group compared with control. Notably, NK cell activation induced by YC-1101 intensified cytotoxicity against various cancer cell lines, and combining YC-1101 with immune checkpoint inhibition synergistically enhanced antitumor activity. Collectively, our results indicate that integration of YC-1101 with expanded NK cells could be a promising approach to augment cancer treatment efficacy.",
    "Ceftazidime/avibactam and aztreonam combined with an aminoglycoside combat metallo-β-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae.. Karunanidhi A, Singh N, Watkins JV, Smith NM, Zang Y, Shan X, Espinoza G 2nd, Li J, Lang Y, Bulitta JB, Bulman ZP (2026). There is an urgent need for additional therapeutic solutions to treat serious bacterial infections caused by metallo-β-lactamase (MBL)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae. Aztreonam, when partnered with ceftazidime/avibactam, has in vitro activity against most MBL-producing K. pneumoniae, but clinical outcomes may be suboptimal. The purpose of this study was to determine if aminoglycosides can enhance the pharmacodynamic activity of ceftazidime/avibactam plus aztreonam against MBL-producing K. pneumoniae. K. pneumoniae isolates harboring MBL genes (blaNDM, blaVIM, and blaIMP) were evaluated in time-kill assays (n = 4 isolates) and the hollow fiber infection model (HFIM, n = 2 isolates). Clinically relevant doses of antibiotics were simulated in the HFIM, and observed antibiotic exposures represented the upper end of the expected patient plasma concentrations. Resistance was tracked during the HFIM, and confocal microscopy was used to assess cell morphology following antibiotic exposure. Both ceftazidime/avibactam + aztreonam and plazomicin were effective individually at reducing viable bacterial counts of susceptible MBL-producing K. pneumoniae, particularly in the HFIM. Combination regimens with aminoglycosides (amikacin or plazomicin) occasionally demonstrated synergy using traditional definitions based on viable colony counting, but they were able to consistently reduce bacterial turbidity and the emergence of filamentous cells that were observed during exposure to ceftazidime/avibactam + aztreonam. Combinations between ceftazidime/avibactam, aztreonam, and an aminoglycoside are a potentially promising therapeutic strategy to combat the rising threat posed by MBL-producing K. pneumoniae.",
    "Infantile Congenital Nevus With Atypical Proliferative Nodules and NTRK Gene Fusion.. Xue S, Song X, Zheng M, Li M, Cheng S, Lu C, Bao J, Fu F, Liu Q (2026). Infantile congenital melanocytic nevus (CMN) is a rare type of benign skin lesion originating from neural crest cells. A proliferative nodule (PN) may develop within CMN, and in some cases, atypical proliferative nodules (APNs) with distinct histopathological features may arise, complicating clinical diagnosis and management. This report describes a case of a giant infantile CMN with APN and novel genetic findings, including TPR::NTRK1 gene fusion and MCL1 amplification. An 8-day-old male presented with a large, uniform, hairless black lesion on the plantar skin. Histological examination revealed nevomelanocytes arranged in a nest-like pattern within the epidermis and dermis. The PN displayed distinct boundaries, with spindle-shaped and oval cells exhibiting pleomorphism, and diffuse infiltration into the subcutaneous fascia and skeletal muscle. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated diffuse positivity for HMB45, Melan-A, and S-100 in nevus cells. In the PN, pan-TRK was positive, CD99 showed weak and focal expression, P16 was retained, and PRAME was negative. Genetic analysis revealed a TPR::NTRK1 gene fusion and MCL1 amplification, suggesting a molecular basis for the atypical features observed in the nodule. This case highlights the role of TPR::NTRK1 fusion in driving abnormal melanocyte proliferation and the potential contribution of MCL1 amplification to tumor progression. These findings provide insights into the genetic underpinnings of APN in CMN and suggest potential therapeutic targets for high-risk lesions.",
    "Individual and Environmental Factors Influencing Influenza Transmission: A Multilevel Analysis.. Nazia N, Pullenayegum E, Loeb M (2026). BACKGROUND: Influenza transmission is influenced by both individual characteristics and community-level drivers. Understanding how these drivers jointly influence transmission is important to predicting outbreaks and guiding influenza prevention strategies. Our study aimed to assess individual and colony-level influences, including vaccination and environmental factors, on influenza transmission in the Hutterite communities. METHODS: We analyzed data from 3271 individuals in 46 Canadian Hutterite colonies during the 2008 influenza season. Weekly PCR-confirmed Influenza A and B outcomes were examined in relation to demographic, vaccination, geographic, and weather variables using multilevel Bayesian hierarchical models in Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations (INLA), which accounted for colony clustering and temporal autocorrelation. RESULTS: Of the 3271 participants, 239 (7.3%) had PCR-confirmed influenza (128 Influenza A and 111 Influenza B cases). Older age was found to be protective, especially for Influenza B, while males had slightly lower odds than females. Individual vaccination showed little effect, while colony assignment to influenza vaccination was associated with a lower risk of Influenza A and overall Influenza (A/B). Higher weekly mean temperatures were associated with lower odds of Influenza A but with higher odds of Influenza B. Precipitation showed weak associations, and geographic factors such as elevation and distance to the nearest city suggested possible protective effects, but results were imprecise. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that influenza risk in Hutterite colonies is associated with local environmental and geographic characteristics in addition to the individual drivers. Incorporating the community-level environmental setting in influenza surveillance may improve preparedness for future outbreaks.",
    "Conjoined Parasitic Twins (Cephalo-Thoracopagus Parasiticus) in a Free Ranging Northern Bat (Eptesicus nilssonii): A Micro-CT Anatomic and Genetic Survey.. Meyer J, Laine VN, van der Kooij J, Richter B, Handschuh S, Gumpenberger M (2026). The detailed anatomical situation of male stillborn cephalo-thoracopagus twins in a wild ranging northern bat (Eptesicus nilssonii) is described by means of full body micro-CT scans in high resolution with three-dimensional computational reconstruction. The external anatomy was characterised by supernumerary wings and legs and marked cranial disfiguration. The most striking features of the internal anatomy were the presence of two hearts with different characteristics, three lungs with two tracheas, three kidneys as well as a doubled liver. Vascular aberrations and other organ deformities are described in detail. The monozygotic origin of the present parasitic conjoined twin was shown by genetic sequencing, analysis and relatedness calculations based on individual tissue samples from the autosite and the parasite. As the free ranging 1 year old mother of this twin returned every year to the same well monitored nursery colony in Norway to give birth to its pups, we can present the life history of the mother bat including the reproductive data of five more consecutive years. This enabled us also to evaluate the birthing process of the conjoined twin in the light of physiological behavioural birthing data.",
    "A novel mutation in colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) causing CSF1R-related disorder (CSF1R-RD).. Sonti AN, Joe E, Berry JV, McDonnell M, Sajjadi SA, Sheik-Bahaei N, Amezcua L, Feigenbaum D, Lew MF, Blurton-Jones M, Head E, Ringman JM (2026). CSF1R-related disorder (CSF1R-RD) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder linked to mutations in the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) gene. Over 200 mutations and diverse clinicoradiographic phenotypes have been described thus far. This case series presents three patients with two CSF1R mutations (I827N and S840C) of which the S840C mutation is novel. We detail their clinical presentations, diagnostic evaluations, and the autopsy findings for one case associated with the I827N mutation, offering new insights into the pathology of this disease.",
    "Assessment of factors affecting timing of discharge in pediatric cancer patients with febrile neutropenia.. Üstün C, Aydın B, Kurucu N, Yalçın B, Varan A, Kutluk T (2025). BACKGROUND: Febrile neutropenia is a common cause of hospital admissions among pediatric cancer patients. To optimize personalized approaches for hospitalization and antibiotic treatment, risk stratification has been proposed. This study aimed to explore the impact of clinical and laboratory parameters on risk stratification for patient discharge. METHODS: This prospective study included pediatric lymphoma and solid tumor patients who were hospitalized due to febrile neutropenia between June 2018 and June 2019. Patient characteristics, primary oncological diagnosis and disease status, comorbid conditions, time elapsed after the last course of chemotherapy, use of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) prophylaxis, presence of port catheter, infection type, fever values/duration, physical examination findings, and duration of neutropenia were collected. Laboratory investigations including complete blood counts, acute phase reactants at the onset of the episode, culture results were also recorded. RESULTS: The study examined 142 febrile neutropenic episodes from 88 consecutive patients. The median age of the study group was 6.8 years, with 19.3% of cases being lymphoma and 80.7% having solid tumors. The median hospital stay was 7 days. Factors associated with longer hospitalization periods included a lymphoma diagnosis, presence of comorbid conditions, bone marrow involvement, and febrile neutropenic period during hospitalization. Patients presenting with fever ≥ 39 °C at admission, poor general appearance, hypotension, prolonged capillary filling time, and severe infection signs had longer hospital stays. In febrile neutropenic episodes, absolute monocyte count ≤ 100 cells/mm3, platelet count ≤ 50,000/mm3, and prolonged neutropenia delayed discharge time. Patients with microbiologically defined infections, especially those with positive catheter cultures, also had delayed discharge. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of lymphoma, poor general condition at admission, presence of microbiologically defined infection, thrombocytopenia, delayed recovery of absolute neutrophil counts, and prolonged fever duration were significant factors in determining the treatment duration and predicting discharge time.",
    "Adjunctive GM-CSF therapy enhances host defense against systemic Candida auris infection in immunosuppressed mice.. Mattos EC, Das Gupta K, Quintanilla D, Hautau H, Ibrahim AS, Singh S (2025). INTRODUCTION: Candida auris is an emerging, multidrug-resistant fungal pathogen associated with high mortality in immunocompromised individuals. Resistance to current antifungal drugs emphasizes the need for new therapeutic approaches. We investigated granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) as a standalone immunotherapy and in combination with a sub-therapeutic dose of micafungin in an immunosuppressed mouse model of systemic C. auris infection. METHODS: Immunosuppressed ICR CD-1 mice (4-6 weeks old) were infected with C. auris and treated daily via intraperitoneal injection with PBS (placebo), murine GM-CSF (0.2 or 2 μg), micafungin, or both. Treatments began 24 h post-infection and continued through day 4 (GM-CSF) or day 7 (micafungin). Survival, tissue fungal burden, histopathology, and immune cell frequencies in spleen and kidneys were assessed. GM-CSF effects on neutrophil and macrophage antifungal functions were evaluated in ex vivo assays. RESULTS: GM-CSF monotherapy significantly improved survival (30-32% vs. 0% in controls), extended median survival time, and reduced fungal burden in the kidney, heart, and brain. Although the combination therapy yielded the highest survival rate, it did not differ significantly from GM-CSF alone. Histopathological examination confirmed decreased fungal load and tissue damage in GM-CSF-treated mice. Additionally, GM-CSF augmented macrophage and neutrophil populations in spleen and kidney, enhanced fungal uptake and killing via reactive oxygen species and neutrophil extracellular traps. DISCUSSION: GM-CSF augments antifungal immunity and represents a promising adjunctive immunotherapy against MDR C. auris infection.",
    "Spatiotemporal Variation in Marine Mammal Antipredator Behaviors Resulting From a Predation Pinch Point.. Hale CM, Jouma'a J, Brown A, Robinson PW, Holser RR, Costa DP, Beltran RS (2026). Predator-prey relationships are fundamental aspects of ecological systems that determine the behavior and distribution of animals across time and space. Variation in predation risk can be used to explore when and why individuals perform antipredator behaviors. In marine environments, it is difficult to observe predation and antipredator behaviors. Fortunately, biologgers have long been used to study the distribution and dive behaviors of northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) on their twice-yearly foraging trips. Here, we analyzed the horizontal and vertical movements of 353 adult female seals across 17 years to investigate how they move through a \"predation pinch point\"-an area where predators and prey co-occur due to habitat features. Specifically, we explored the diel timing of departure from and arrival to the colony and spatial concentrations in benthic diving (diving close to/along the seafloor). Benthic diving and temporal concentrations in movement to and from the colony may serve antipredator functions, such as minimizing detection and ambush by predators. We found that only the timing of departure from and not arrival to the colony showed any significant temporal pattern. Seals tended to depart during the late afternoon or at night but arrived throughout the day. Spatially, there were consistent patterns of benthic dives during the first and final parts of their trips as seals crossed the continental shelf. By combining dive, location, bathymetry, and predator data, we were able to identify how seals modified behaviors that likely help them avoid predators. These findings illustrate how animals respond to varying levels of predation risk and can be used to develop more precise dynamic landscapes of fear.",
    "Space Use and Movements During Egg Laying Associated With Nest Fate and Female Survival in Eastern Wild Turkeys.. Goodman PE, Bakner NW, Gulotta NA, Ulrey EE, Collier BA, Chamberlain MJ (2026). Reproduction is a fundamental aspect of a species' life history that is energetically costly, yet critical for population sustainability and genetic diversity. Wild turkeys exhibit high rates of nest loss and female mortality during reproduction, prompting females to make decisions related to spatial and movement decisions during nesting. Using GPS data from eastern wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris ), we assessed female movements and space use during laying and evaluated potential impacts of those metrics on nest success and female survival during incubation. We used a Bayesian logistic regression to estimate nest success and female survival based on space use, daily movements, and range overlap with conspecifics during the laying period. We found that with each increase of ~700 m in average daily distance traveled during laying, there was a 1.73% decrease in the probability of nest success. We also found that having a greater number of conspecific females with overlapping core areas had a positive influence on nest fate. Specifically, an increase of 1 overlapping female (one standard deviation) was associated with a 4.76% increase in the probability of nest success. Conversely, we found weak support that female survival was positively related to increasing average daily distances traveled. Our findings suggest that female wild turkeys perceive reproductive advantages to sharing space with conspecifics during the laying period. Conversely, our findings suggest that movements of female wild turkeys within their reproductive period may only weakly influence metrics of reproductive success during both laying and incubation.",
    "Spherical petal-like ZnO-NiO p-n junction as an excellent ROS scavenger to inhibit the proliferation and migration of ovarian cancer cells.. Liu S, Cheng Y, Xiong B, Li X, Zhu J, Long C, Yuan S, Cheng Z, Wang L (2026). Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) have been identified as secondary intracellular messengers that exacerbate ovarian cancer progression. Eliminating ROS from the tumor microenvironment presents a compelling strategy for ovarian cancer treatment. In this study, we synthesized a unique spherical petal-like ZnO-NiO p-n junction and evaluated its effectiveness as a ROS scavenger, aiming to curb the proliferation and migration of ovarian cancer cells. Through Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assays, colony formation tests, and Transwell co-culture experiments, we observed that the ZnO-NiO junction curtails ovarian cancer cell proliferation and migration, all while ensuring negligible toxicity to normal human granulosa KGN cells. The anti-cancer efficacy of ZnO-NiO was further validated in vivo, employing an ovarian cancer peritoneal metastasis model. Techniques such as in vivo imaging system (IVIS) imaging, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, and Ki-67 immunostaining collectively attested that ZnO-NiO markedly obstructs ovarian cancer growth and metastasis. Notably, ZnO-NiO eradicated the heightened ROS levels induced by ovarian cancer cells within normal cells. Collectively, these findings underscore the potential of ZnO-NiO as a novel therapeutic avenue for ovarian cancer. They also amplify the promise of ROS-scavenging nanoparticles in clinical contexts. The pioneering work on ZnO-NiO not only heralds a promising intervention against ovarian cancer but also stimulates future explorations in ROS-centric cancer therapies.",
    "Food-web structures link multi-scale processes in complex landscapes.. Harris HAL, Tonkin JD, Murray TJ, Maloney RF, McIntosh AR (2026). Complex landscapes are challenging to study because both the higher level contextual and interacting lower level mechanistic processes underpinning their ecological characteristics occur simultaneously. However, food-web structures can provide process insight in such landscapes by identifying these processes in specific contexts. Here, we used stable isotopes to identify spatially separate resources and infer resource flows underpinning food-web structures in a braided river. We found that river resources used by mobile consumers, including birds and fish, were spatially heterogeneous. Consumer resource use was related to four key structural food-web attributes: (1) spatiotemporal variation in foraging, (2) subsidies, (3) omnivory, and (4) ontogenetic niche shifts. Thus, both physical heterogeneity (contextual physical processes) and adaptive characteristics of consumers (mechanistic processes) were likely contributing to important food-web structures. Identifying these food-web structures in landscapes, across scales of resource use and spatial distribution, provides a way to identify processes and scales likely contributing to food-web stabilization.",
    "FOLR1 Mediated by ITCH Promotes Paclitaxel Resistance by Suppressing Pyroptosis in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma.. Zhang G, Song Y, Liu H, Xiao J, Zeng S, Li W, Tan G, Wang X (2026). Paclitaxel is a frequently employed chemotherapeutic agent for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients, and tumor cell resistance to paclitaxel poses a significant challenge to NPC treatment. This study investigated the impact and potential mechanisms of folate-receptor 1 (FOLR1) on paclitaxel resistance in NPC cells. Levels of FOLR1 in NPC tissues and cells were measured using RT-qPCR. Protein expression was analyzed by Western blot. IC50 of paclitaxel-treated NPC cells was assessed by CCK-8. EdU and Colony formation assay detected cell proliferation. Apoptosis and pyroptosis were evaluated utilizing flow cytometry. Expression and localization of ITCH and FOLR1 were detected by immunofluorescence staining. Interaction between ITCH and FOLR1 was tested by co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP). The immunoprecipitation assay evaluated FOLR1 ubiquitination levels. An NPC xenograft model was constructed in nude mice. FOLR1 was overexpressed in NPC and correlates with a poor prognosis in NPC patients. Low levels of cell pyroptosis and elevated FOLR1 expression were strongly associated with paclitaxel resistance in NPC. Knockdown of FOLR1 reduced the chemoresistance of 5-8 F/paclitaxel cells to paclitaxel. ITCH was associated with FOLR1 and enhanced its degradation through ubiquitination. ITCH reduced paclitaxel resistance in NPC cells via downregulation of FOLR1. FOLR1 increased resistance to paclitaxel by suppressing pyroptosis in NPC through an NLRP3-dependent mechanism. FOLR1 inhibited pyroptosis by inhibiting the mTOR pathway and promoting autophagy. Lowering FOLR1 expression suppressed tumor growth and boosted paclitaxel sensitivity in mice. FOLR1 plays a significant role in promoting chemoresistance of NPC cells to paclitaxel through NLRP3 signaling.",
    "Evolutionary streamlining of GPCRs in Hymenoptera and their protentional functional roles in host exploitation.. Zhang S, Fang M, Wang L, Liu H, Liu T, Gao H, Tan A (2026). Parasitic wasps (Hymenoptera) are important biological control agents, yet studies on the function and evolution of their G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) remain limited. To address this gap, we systematically identified GPCRs in seven representative hymenopteran species based on evolutionary relationships, and found notable contraction compared to basal hymenopterans. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis revealed extensive contraction in Family A GPCRs and methuselah-like (mthl) genes. Among the species analyzed, Gregopimpla kuwanae was selected for detailed experimental studies due to its relatively large size and suitability for laboratory manipulation. Temporal gene expression analysis in G. kuwanae showed that opsins and biogenic amine receptors exhibit low expression during the larval stages, likely reflecting adaptations associated with its parasitic lifestyle. Moreover, transcriptomic comparisons before and after initial host feeding in G. kuwanae showed 63 GPCRs showing higher expression before feeding, suggesting their involvement in host detection and feeding initiation. Notably, we found that short neuropeptide F (sNPF) and its receptor are highly expressed in females before their initial host-feeding experience, and RNAi knockdown of either gene significantly reduced both feeding motivation and intake, confirming their key function in parasitic feeding behavior. Together, our study elucidates how a streamlined GPCR repertoire supports essential life-history traits in parasitic wasps and provides a framework for leveraging these receptors in targeted biological-control strategies.",
    "PSMC4 promotes low-grade glioma progression and predicts poor prognosis.. Ming W, Yunhui S, Dongjuan C, Yanhong Z, Huijie B, Hui Z, Liquan Q, Zhongliang D, Liping W (2026). BACKGROUND: Low-grade gliomas (LGG) are aggressive brain tumors with high rates of recurrence and poor prognosis. PSMC4, a proteasome subunit, plays a role in various cancers, but its function in LGG remains poorly understood. This study explores PSMC4's impact on LGG progression. METHODS: PSMC4 expression in LGG patients was analyzed using data from TCGA, CGGA, and GEO. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression models assessed survival outcomes. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) identified key pathways affected by PSMC4. Immune infiltration was evaluated using the TIMER database. In vitro, SHG44 cells were transfected with shRNA targeting PSMC4, and assays for cell proliferation, migration, clonogenicity, and invasion were performed. In vivo xenograft assays were also conducted. RESULTS: High PSMC4 expression was linked to higher tumor grade and poor prognosis in LGG patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed shorter overall survival for patients with high PSMC4 expression. ROC curve analysis confirmed the diagnostic value of PSMC4 for predicting poor prognosis. GSEA identified pathways like Notch, Toll-like receptor, and VEGF signaling that may be regulated by PSMC4. In vitro, PSMC4 knockdown significantly reduced SHG44 and T98 cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while clonogenic assays showed decreased colony formation. In vivo, PSMC4 knockdown led to smaller tumor volumes in xenograft models, confirming its role in tumor progression. CONCLUSION: PSMC4 overexpression promotes LGG progression and may be an independent marker of poor prognosis. Targeting PSMC4 can reduce tumor growth and metastasis, providing a promising strategy for LGG treatment. Further research on its regulatory mechanisms and clinical implications is warranted.",
    "Bicuculline reversal of aminoglycoside O-nucleotidyltransferase EanT-1-mediated kanamycin resistance.. Wang J, Yu M, Zhang M, Meng Z, Yang P, Cui X, Yu Z, Wang Y, Zong G (2026). BACKGROUND: Kanamycin, an aminoglycoside, is an effective broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent against bacterial infections. However, the clinical efficacy of aminoglycosides has been overshadowed by the emergence of resistance mechanisms involving enzyme-mediated covalent modifications. Aminoglycoside nucleotidyltransferases (ANTs) inactivate aminoglycosides via AMP group transfer. Elucidating their molecular mechanisms and identifying effective inhibitors are critical for combating antimicrobial resistance. METHODS: Exiguobacterium sp. PL221A was isolated from hospital sewage under selection with 16 mg/L aminoglycosides. Following genomic sequencing using the Oxford Nanopore and BGISEQ-500 platforms, the eanT-1 gene encoding an ANT was identified, cloned, and expressed in Escherichia coli DH5α. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) against kanamycin were determined. Protein-ligand interactions between Eant-1 and kanamycin, virtual mutations of EanT-1, and inhibitor screening were assessed using the MaXFlow platform. To evaluate the catalytic mechanism, eant-1 mutants were expressed in vitro and their kinetic parameters were characterized. The impact of bicuculline on MICs and time-kill curves was also evaluated. RESULTS: Strain PL221A exhibited notable resistance to neomycin, kanamycin, and gentamicin (all MICs > 128 mg/L). Heterologous expression indicated that EanT-1 confers kanamycin resistance. Mutation of residues D43A and D98A abrogated enzymatic activity, whereas alanine substitutions at R51 and T100 had no apparent effect. Bicuculline, an isoquinoline alkaloid compound, was identified as an effective EanT-1 inhibitor, showing stronger binding affinity (-8.72 kcal/mol) for EanT-1 than kanamycin (-7.51 kcal/mol) and an ability to occupy aspartate residues critical for electrophilic polarization. Its hydroxyl-free alkaloid scaffold may prevent adenylation, enabling competitive binding with kanamycin at the catalytic site and inactivating EanT-1. Additionally, the combination of kanamycin and bicuculline effectively inhibited the growth of eanT-1-expressing bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: The ANT encoded by eanT-1 in Exiguobacterium sp. PL221A mediates resistance to kanamycin, which can be counteracted by the alkaloid bicuculline through inhibition of its catalytic activity.",
    "An intelligent monitoring system for forecasting and anomaly detection in precision beekeeping.. Huet JC, Bougueroua L, Metidji SA (2026). Bees play a vital ecological role as pollinators, contributing to biodiversity, forest regeneration, and agricultural productivity. In recent years, precision beekeeping has emerged as a promising approach to support hive management through sensor-based monitoring. However, existing systems often lack predictive capabilities, limiting their usefulness in anticipating disruptive events that threaten colony health. To address this gap, we present BeeViz, an intelligent monitoring system that combines time series forecasting and anomaly detection to enhance decision-making in apiculture. The system integrates sensor networks, cloud infrastructure, and AI-based data processing modules to continuously track key hive parameters (temperature, humidity, and weight) and generate short-term forecasts and real-time alerts. Preliminary results show that the system can effectively detect anomalies and generate short-term forecasts for key hive parameters, with promising accuracy across different metrics. By enabling proactive interventions, BeeViz supports more resilient and sustainable beekeeping practices, paving the way for collaborative learning and data-driven hive management.",
    "Learning-aided Artificial Bee Colony with neural knowledge transfer for global optimization.. Saini G, Jadon SS, Chaube S (2026). A critical challenge in swarm intelligence is the effective utilization of knowledge gained during the search, a process often confounded by the risk of negative knowledge transfer. To address this, we introduce the Learning-Aided Artificial Bee Colony (LA-ABC), a novel framework guided by a Neural Knowledge Transfer mechanism for global optimization. Our framework establishes a co-evolutionary mechanism between the search process of the ABC algorithm and an online neural knowledge learning engine. LA-ABC operates on a dual-pathway architecture, probabilistically arbitrating between foundational swarm exploration and a knowledge-transfer pathway. In this second pathway, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) learns a predictive, non-linear model from a dynamic archive of historically successful solutions. This approach enables the model to interpret the complex context of successful moves, thereby preventing the negative knowledge transfer where a beneficial pattern in one region of the search space could be detrimental in another. This learned intelligence is then operationalized through a generative operator that transfers validated positive knowledge to create high-quality candidate solutions. The process transforms the ABC from a memoryless explorer into an intelligent agent that learns to navigate the fitness landscape with high efficacy. The superiority of the LA-ABC framework is demonstrated through comprehensive benchmarking on 23 standard test functions, the competitive IEEE CEC 2019 suite, and a real-world photovoltaic parameter extraction problem. Our proposed neural knowledge transfer approach significantly outperforms 12 state-of-the-art algorithms, including ABC, L-SHADE, JSO, L-DE, L-PSO, KL-variants, and RL variants with the significance of these improvements validated by rigorous statistical tests (Wilcoxon, Bonferroni-Dunn, Friedman, and ANOVA). Ultimately, LA-ABC provides a robust new paradigm for integrating reinforcement learning and knowledge transfer within evolutionary computation.",
    "The first mitochondrial genome for Sterictiphorinae (Hymenoptera: Argidae) and insights into argid phylogeny.. Park B, Hwang UW (2026). The family Argidae is a significant group of agricultural and forest pests, yet its mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) diversity remains only partially understood. To expand current knowledge, we sequenced and characterized, for the first time, the mitogenome of Sterictiphora koreana Lee and Wei 2017 involving in subfamily Sterictiphorinae, an endemic species in Korea. Comparative analyses with four argid species (one Sterictiphorinae and three Arginae) reveal a conserved gene arrangement generally matching the basal hymenopteran form, except for one or four tRNA gene translocations. Whole mitogenomes, protein-coding genes (PCGs), tRNAs, and rRNAs of Arginae, show higher AT content than those of Sterictiphorinae. GC skew values range from - 0.376 to - 0.110 for all four argid species, though a subset of PCGs, tRNAs, and rRNAs in Arge aurora exhibit positive. Phylogenetic analyses based on nucleotide sequences of the 13 PCGs strongly support the monophyly of Argidae within superfamily Tenthredinoidea. Divergence time estimation suggests Argidae originated around 166.38 Ma in the Middle Jurassic, with subsequent diversification occurring from the Early Cretaceous to Eocene. These findings enhance our understanding of mitogenome evolution in Argidae and provide a foundation for broader investigations in symphytan phylogenetics and taxonomy.",
    "CSF1R mutations in an Italian population of early-onset dementia: a case series.. Pancaldi B, Mastrangelo A, Zilioli A, Ruggeri E, Vacchiano V, Pasini E, Busi G, Parchi P, Spallazzi M, Capellari S (2026). The diagnostic approach to subjects with early-onset dementia (EOD) is often challenging due to the broader range of possible etiologies as compared to late-onset dementia cases. Pathogenic variants in CSF1R gene have been increasingly reported in subjects with EOD, mostly clinically mimicking behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). Here we screened for variants in CSF1R gene in a large cohort of dementia patients consecutively referred for genetic analysis to an Italian tertiary center between 2005 and 2024 (n = 2163). Sequence of CSF1R gene was determined with next-generation sequencing through either a dedicated panel or whole-exome sequencing. Pathogenic variants or variants of uncertain significance with higher evidence of pathogenicity were found in four participants (one female); three of these were not previously reported. Clinical data were collected, including brain magnetic resonance imaging and neuropsychological assessment. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of neurofilament light chain (NfL) protein were measured. A family history of dementia was present in one subject. Mean age at onset was 51.5. Seizures were the presenting symptom in two cases and later appeared in other two. Two subjects presented with behavioral disturbances, resembling early bvFTD. Neuropsychological assessment revealed executive and language impairment in most cases. Anterior-predominant atrophy, symmetric white-matter involvement, and serpentine calcifications were the most common imaging abnormalities. High CSF NfL levels were found in all cases, with two of them showing markedly elevated values. CSF1R-related disease should be considered in EOD subjects, especially those presenting with executive/language deficits, seizures, white matter involvement, and markedly elevated CSF NfL levels.",
    "Human prestige psychology can promote adaptive inequality in social influence.. Morgan TJH, Watson R, Lenfesty HL, Brand CO (2026). Human hunter-gatherer groups were commonly thought to be broadly egalitarian, with increasingly formal hierarchical social structures hypothesized to spread following the introduction of agriculture. However, this view is being challenged by mounting evidence for social hierarchies in several foraging populations. Nonetheless, the processes by which such hierarchies emerge, and whether human hierarchies are homologous with non-human systems of dominance, remains unclear. Here we examine the role of prestige, the tendency to freely confer status and influence on skilled or esteemed individuals and a proposed component of human-unique cultural psychology, in generating unequal patterns of social influence. Through a combination of cultural evolutionary modelling, human experimentation, and evolutionary simulations, we find that human prestige psychology generates highly unequal influence hierarchies, and that the \"prestige sensitivity\" we measure empirically in human participants closely matches the predictions of our evolutionary simulations, suggesting it is an evolved psychological adaptation. Nonetheless, unlike non-human dominance hierarchies, the processes involved are non-coercive, being driven by individuals freely seeking high quality information. We thus conclude that social hierarchies plausibly have a deep evolutionary history in our lineage, with prestige enabling hierarchies to be mutually beneficial as opposed to coercive.",
    "uPAR Is Regulated via miR-561-3p and Affects the Progression and Aggressiveness of CRC Cells.. Yang X, Wang X, Sang L (2025). OBJECTIVE: Urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), its receptor uPAR, and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1), constitute the plasminogen urokinase activation system that is thought to be associated with the malignant biology of cancer cells. Nevertheless, the regulation mechanism of uPAR expression in colorectal cancer remains unclear. METHODS: The effect of uPAR and miR-516-3p on CRC cells was explored through Methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay, colony formation, Transwell, and Apoptosis assays. Dual-luciferase reporter assays, reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), and Western blot assay were carried out to determine that uPAR is directly regulated by miR-561-3p. Levels of protein expression were analyzed by Western blot assay. RESULTS: In the study, we showed that uPAR was upregulated in serum samples from CRC patients and associated with the more advanced stage and distant metastasis in patients with CRC. In CRC cells, uPAR promotes cell growth, migration, and invasion, while inhibiting cell apoptosis. In addition, the expression of uPAR is negatively regulated by miR-561-3p through binging its 3' UTR. CONCLUSION: uPAR is downregulated by miR-561-3p, contributing to tumorigenesis in colorectal cancer.",
    "Assessing honeybee colony health using temperature time series.. Arias-Calluari K, Colin T, Latty T, Myerscough M, Altmann EG (2026). Honeybees face an increasing number of stressors that disrupt the natural behaviour of colonies and, in extreme cases, can lead to their collapse. Quantifying the status and resilience of colonies is essential to measure the impact of stressors and to identify colonies at risk. In this article, we present and apply a methodology to efficiently diagnose the status of a honeybee colony based on a metric of its thermoregulatory capacity. This metric is derived from data-informed analysis of time series, specifically the hive's core temperature in relation to environmental temperature. Healthy honeybee colonies have a remarkable ability to control temperature near the brood area. Our method exploits this fact and quantifies the status of a hive by measuring how resilient they are to extreme environmental temperatures, which act as natural stressors. After analysing 22 hives during different times of the year, including three hives that collapsed, we find the statistical signatures of stress that reveal whether honeybee colonies are stable or are at risk of failure. Based on these analyses, we propose a simple scale of hive status (stable, warning and collapse) that, once calibrated, can be used to diagnose hive status from a few temperature measurements. Our approach offers a lower cost and practical bee-monitoring solution, providing a non-invasive way to track hive conditions and trigger interventions to save colonies from collapse.",
    "DNA methylation reflects tissue and caste identity but not parasitism-induced changes in a social insect.. Blasi G, Darras H, Foitzik S (2026). The role of DNA methylation in regulating transcriptional activity and post-transcriptional modifications in insects, particularly in social insects, remains debated. Social insect castes, primarily determined by differential gene expression, exhibit pronounced phenotypic differences in morphology, life history traits and behaviour. In some ants, parasites induce divergent phenotypes, but the role of DNA methylation in this remains poorly understood. In this study, we examined DNA methylation patterns across different tissues (brain and fat body) and castes (queens and workers) in the ant Temnothorax nylanderi. We also compared healthy workers with those infected with the cestode Anomotaenia brevis, which is associated with changes in lifespan, morphology and behaviour. Our results reveal significant differences in gene body methylation across tissues, which were positively linked to gene expression. We also observed caste-specific differences in DNA methylation, particularly in the fat body. Surprisingly, however, we detected no differences in DNA methylation between cestode-infected and healthy workers, despite pronounced differences in transcriptional activity, suggesting that other epigenetic mechanisms exert stronger regulatory control over parasite-induced transcriptional changes. The pronounced differences in DNA methylation between tissues and castes, partly associated with transcriptional variation, warrant further investigation into their functional role, including the modulation of alternative splicing.",
    "Multiple weak biases support adaptive choices without prior experience: a self-supervised strategy.. Versace E, de Bivort BL (2026). From social interaction to foraging, the survival of newborn animals depends on their ability to make adaptive decisions without prior experience. While ethological research focused on strong innate biases, recent empirical evidence shows that early preferences are often weak, transient and variable. After reviewing these findings, we introduce a novel model that explains how multiple weak biases can support adaptive choices in naive, inexperienced animals. We propose a self-supervised strategy in which naive animals combine internal predispositions with environmental structure to guide behaviour. First, predispositions target features that are rare in the background but common in relevant stimuli (e.g. red colour, upward movement), thus reducing false positives. Second, the evolution of multiple weak biases allows animals to increase accuracy of decisions using co-occurring cues (e.g. colour, sound and movement). Weak biases are advantageous as they prevent strong responses to misleading partial matches. Requiring the co-occurrence of multiple rare cues supports effective choices in complex environments with many misleading stimuli. This simple self-supervised strategy offers a new framework for understanding early decision-making, with implications that span across behavioural ecology, developmental psychology, comparative cognition and artificial intelligence, where decision-making with sparse evidence is a crucial challenge.",
    "Flower constancy in pollinators: a bouquet of agendas shapes interactions among mutualistic partners.. Grüter C (2026). Plant-pollinator interactions have become a major research area because of their impact on key ecosystem services. One pollinator behaviour of particular importance is flower constancy, the tendency to temporarily focus on one flower species during a foraging trip, thereby promoting cross-pollination. The costs and benefits of flower constancy for plants and pollinators are varied, complex and far from understood. This review aims to synthesize studies spanning the last decades, from both plant and pollinator perspectives. Flower constancy is often viewed as an epiphenomenon of pollinator cognition, but there is increasing recognition that pollinators show remarkable behavioural flexibility in their flower choice, often in response to ecological and social factors. Plants usually benefit from flower constancy, which reduces pollen loss and interspecific pollen transfer. However, in some situations, pollinator inconstancy can be advantageous owing to increased visits from pollinators shared with co-flowering plants, a process called facilitation. The fitness consequences of pollinator behaviour for rare or invasive plants are intriguing yet little understood, with important implications for plant conservation. Rather than seeing flower constancy as a strategy imposed on pollinators by cognitive constraints, this review emphasises that plants and pollinators pursue varied agendas depending on their ecological context and lifestyle.",
    "Identification of repopulated microglia-associated genes in microglia depleted/repopulated mice after spinal cord injury.. Xue S, Hu D, Li L, Sun Y, Wei X, Xiao Y, Jiang Q, Qi C, Fu H (2026). This study aimed to investigate the effects of repopulated microglia on neural repair and functional recovery and identify repopulated microglia-associated repair-promoting genes after spinal cord injury (SCI) in mice following depletion of microglia via the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) inhibitor PLX3397. Mice were divided into control, sustained microglial depletion, and microglial depletion/repopulation groups according to being treated standard or PLX3397 diet. Mice in all groups were subjected to a complete spinal cord crush injury. Comprehensive assessments were performed using behavioral scoring, immunofluorescence staining 21 days post-injury, and RNA sequencing 21 days post-injury. Results demonstrated that PLX3397 effectively eliminated approximately 95 % of microglia in the mouse spinal cord. Upon drug withdrawal, microglia rapidly repopulated and exhibited a pro-regenerative phenotype. Repopulated microglia significantly promoted post-injury motor functional recovery, increased neuronal survival, and reduced glial scar formation. Transcriptomic analysis identified genes associated with repopulated microglia, which were enriched in immune response, complement activation, phagocytosis, and cytokine signaling pathways. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis of these associated genes further pinpointed key genes, includingIl1b,Ccr2, and Il15. This study reveals that repopulated microglia may exert neuroprotective effects by modulating the immune microenvironment. The 336 repopulated microglia-associated genes identified in this study, and the identified key genes that are preferentially upregulated in repopulated microglia may represent novel therapeutic targets for SCI.",
    "Torpor in a passerine bird expands the scope of avian heterothermy.. Barratt A, Welbergen JA, Moore BD, Hunt A, Turbill C (2026). Torpor is a controlled physiological state of reduced metabolism and typically body temperature (Tb) used by some endothermic animals to reduce their resting energy expenditure1,2 and increase survival during unfavorable environmental conditions.3,4,5,6 Passerine birds, the largest avian order, have long been considered limited to shallow reductions of Tb (min. Tb usually >30°C; undocumented <23°C) during part of their rest phase,7,8 with deeper and longer torpor restricted to a few non-passerine bird groups.9 Here, we used temperature telemetry to record the skin temperature (Ts; as a close proxy for core Tb) of free-living white-backed swallows (Cheramoeca leucosterna; 15 g) during winter in inland Australia. This species is an aerial foraging passerine bird that roosts in burrows. On most nights, we measured only shallow reductions in Ts; however, during and after rainfall events, tagged birds remained inactive in their burrows during the daytime and employed bouts of torpor that were relatively deep (min. Ts: 18.8°C) and long (max.: 17.5 h). The depth of torpor and extension of torpor beyond the nocturnal rest phase expand the known capabilities for heterothermy within passerine birds. For aerial foraging swallows, torpor is presumably an important adaptation for reducing starvation risk during weather events that reduce prey availability. Our findings have implications for understanding avian thermoregulatory strategies, the evolution of torpor, and how endothermic animals cope with extreme weather events. They also highlight the power of biologging to reveal previously unknown physiological capabilities and provide insight into the adaptive importance of animal responses to natural environmental conditions.",
    "Smart insurance analytics: A novel ensemble feature selection approach to unlock health insurance coverage predictions in Sierra Leone.. Olawade DB, Osborne A, Soladoye AA, Oluwadare OE, Awogbindin EO, Wada OZ (2026). BACKGROUND: Predicting health insurance uptake remains a critical challenge for policymakers and insurance providers seeking to optimise coverage strategies and resource allocation. In Sierra Leone, health insurance uptake remains extremely low, and understanding determinants is vital for universal health coverage goals. OBJECTIVE: To develop and evaluate an innovative ensemble feature selection methodology for health insurance uptake prediction, establishing new performance benchmarks through systematic comparison of multiple machine learning algorithms using comprehensive validation strategies. METHODS: This study employed supervised machine learning to predict health insurance uptake among 15,574 women using data from the 2019 Sierra Leone Demographic and Health Survey (SLDHS). We implemented an ensemble feature selection approach that requires consensus across Adaptive Ant Colony Optimisation, Recursive Feature Elimination, and Backwards Elimination techniques. Seven algorithms were systematically compared: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and LightGBM. SMOTE addressed class imbalance, whilst validation employed nested 5-fold cross-validation, 10-fold cross-validation, and hold-out testing to prevent information leakage. RESULTS: Random Forest achieved exceptional performance with 0.9973 accuracy, 0.9973 precision, 0.9973 recall, 0.9973 F1-score, and perfect 1.0000 ROC AUC on hold-out testing. XGBoost delivered comparable results with 0.9914 across all metrics and 0.9998 ROC AUC. Backward Feature Elimination consistently yielded superior results across ensemble methods. However, the near-perfect performance warrants cautious interpretation and requires external validation to confirm generalizability. CONCLUSIONS: This research establishes new performance benchmarks for health insurance prediction, significantly exceeding existing literature, which has direct implications for health insurance policy and practice in Sierra Leone. The innovative ensemble feature selection methodology provides a robust framework for enhancing prediction accuracy across healthcare applications, offering immediate practical value for stakeholders. Future work should prioritize external validation, explainability analysis, and temporal stability assessment to ensure practical deployment readiness.",
    "Niacin Modulates Immune Responses in a Phase I Dose-Escalation Clinical Trial of Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma.. Poon CC, Hagen KM, Sarkar S, Mirzaei R, Silva C, Ueno A, de Robles P, Roldan-Urgoiti G, Yong VW (2026). BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Glioblastoma, a highly aggressive and uniformly lethal brain tumor, resists current treatments and immunotherapies by creating a potently immunosuppressive microenvironment. The objective of this study was to determine whether niacin modulates systemic immunity in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. METHODS: In a first-in-human phase I clinical trial (NCT04677049), we investigated the immunologic effects of niacin administration alongside standard-of-care surgery and chemoradiation in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. RESULTS: Niacin treatment increases the frequencies of circulating memory T cells and natural killer cells while decreasing nonclassical monocytes. Furthermore, niacin elevated serum levels of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-12p70 and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and reduced growth-regulated α protein. DISCUSSION: These data demonstrate that niacin induces systemic immunomodulatory effects in patients with glioblastoma, shifting the immune landscape toward an antitumor profile and supporting further evaluation of niacin as a potential therapeutic adjunct. TRIAL REGISTRATION INFORMATION: This ongoing study was registered as NCT04677049 on March 1, 2021, with the first patient enrolled on March 18, 2021. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class IV evidence that niacin dose escalation modulates immune response in patients with glioblastoma treated with standard of care, including maximal safe resection, concurrent radiation and temozolomide, and adjuvant temozolomide administration. This is a Class IV study because it is an open-label trial with no blinding or comparison group.",
    "Genome and transcriptome-based identification and expression profiling of chemosensory gene families across developmental stages and tissues in Sirex noctilio (Hymenoptera: Siricidae).. Postma A, Klynsmith L, Duong TA, Allison JD, Smidt W, Waterhouse RM, Lesny P, Oeyen JP, Petersen M, Martin S, Liu S, Zhou X, Ziesmann T, Donath A, Mayer C, Misof B, Niehuis O, Peters RS, Podsiadlowski L, Coetzee MPA, Joubert F, Slippers B (2026). The Sirex woodwasp (Sirex noctilio; Hymenoptera: Siricidae) is among the most destructive invasive pests affecting Pinus plantations worldwide. Chemosensory systems offer promising targets for pest control strategies. The identification and characterization of chemosensation genes in non-model, economically significant insects such as S. noctilio, is an important first step towards the development of such control methods. Here we sequenced and assembled a draft genome of S. noctilio and performed RNA-sequencing of 15 olfactory and non-olfactory tissues to study the expression patterns of chemosensation-related genes. Specific genes, such as SnocOR16 and SnocSNMP1, displayed tissue- and sex-specific expression patterns, making them particularly intriguing for their potential roles in chemosensation and oviposition. As woodwasps and their related lineages form a sister group to the majority of other Hymenoptera, including Apocrita, insights into their gene repertoires are crucial for tracing the evolutionary history of chemosensory multigene families of this ecologically and economically significant insect order. This study enhances our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying S. noctilio chemosensation, paving the way for further research in chemical ecology and the functional characterization of S. noctilio chemosensation genes.",
    "Effectiveness of experimental composites containing antimicrobial agents for orthodontic applications.. Malavasi CV, da Silva EM, Rodrigues FP, Guimarães JGA, Portela MB, Cabral-Oliveira GG, Poskus LT (2026). This study evaluated the effectiveness of experimental composites containing antimicrobial agents such as nisin (N) and stannous fluoride (SnF2) against S. mutans, for orthodontic applications. First, the antimicrobial agents were added at varying concentrations (%) into a base material consisting of methacrylate monomers and inorganic particles, forming the groups: control (C), N4% (N4), N7% (N7), N10% (N10), SnF20.6% (SnF20.6), SnF21.5% (SnF21.5), SnF2 3% (SnF23), and N4% + SnF2 0. 6% (N4SnF20.6). The degree of conversion (DC%) and colony-forming units (CFU) were evaluated. Brackets were bonded onto the enamel of bovine incisors using these composites, and the enamel hardness was measured at distances of 500, 550, and 600 µm from the bracket, before and after the cariogenic challenge. The shear bond strength was also investigated, and the composite remnant on the enamel was assessed using the ARI score. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance and Tukey's test (α = 0.05). Of all the groups, only N10 led to lower DC% (p < 0.05). CFU was significantly reduced for all groups when compared to C (p < 0.05), with SnF2 showing the highest inhibition for all concentrations. After the cariogenic challenge, for all distances from the brackets, the decrease in hardness was lower for all experimental composites than for C (p < 0.05). SBS was lower only for the N4SnF20.6 when compared to C. Adhesive failure was more frequent, with the composite remnant covering less than 50% of the adhesive area. In conclusion, adding those antimicrobial agents effectively inhibited S. mutans and protected enamel around brackets without compromising most mechanical properties. However, the highest nisin concentration (10%) adversely affected the degree of conversion, and the combination of nisin and stannous fluoride reduced bond strength.",
    "RB-BC: A Novel Ribociclib Derivative Targeting p53-Mediated Apoptosis and Inhibition of Tumor Growth in Breast Cancer.. Zhang B, Asan K, Wang M, Song M, Song X, Wang S, Zhou Y, Yang Z, Lin H, Wang J, Yu X, Wang X, Ji J (2026). Breast cancer persists as the most prevalent malignancy and principal contributor to cancer-associated mortality among women worldwide, exhibiting marked disease heterogeneity and therapeutic resistance. Consequently, the development of novel therapeutic agents remains imperative. Ribociclib, a cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor, has emerged as a focus in adjuvant breast cancer research due to its mechanism of cell cycle arrest induction. Building upon this rationale, we designed and synthesized a novel Ribociclib derivative, RB-BC, systematically investigating its anti-neoplastic efficacy and molecular mechanisms in breast cancer through an integrated in vitro and in vivo experimental system. The compound's anti-proliferative effects were quantitatively assessed via 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation assays, and colony formation assays. Functional characterization through cell adhesion assays, scratch wound healing assays, and Transwell invasion assays demonstrated RB-BC's dose-dependent suppression of tumor migration and invasion. Mechanistic analyses, conducted via RNA sequencing and Western blotting, revealed that its anti-tumor activity primarily stems from the activation of the p53 pathway, which induces caspase-3-mediated apoptosis in breast cancer cells. Machine learning algorithms identified p53-associated genetic signatures, and subsequent bioinformatics analyses elucidated their significant correlation with immune cell infiltration dynamics in the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, RB-BC effectively suppressed tumor growth in vivo and significantly disrupted angiogenesis in the chick chorioallantoic membrane assay. In summary, the Ribociclib-derived compound, RB-BC, demonstrates compelling potential as a candidate therapeutic agent for breast cancer.",
    "Survival and life history of Psix saccharicola (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae) in frozen host eggs and after cold storage as pupae.. Esmaeili Sardary A, Michaud JP, Ranjbar F, Nasiri Y, Salari Rafsanjanipoor S, Motesaddi Zarandi M, Amiri H, Jalali MA (2026). Psix saccharicola Mani (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae) is a key parasitoid of stink bugs eggs in Iranian pistachio orchards, especially Acrosternum arabicum Wagner (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae). Cold storage of host and parasitoid life stages can facilitate parasitoid production and assist application timing in augmentation programs. We tested the suitability of A. arabicum eggs stored at -20 °C and -80 °C for periods of 0 to 90 d for parasitism by P. saccharicola. The fecundity of F1 females declined with duration of host egg storage, more so at -80 °C than at -20 °C, and so did immature survival and sex ratio. Duration of egg storage, but not temperature, affected the survival of F2 parasitoids. The 24-h fecundity of F2 females, their progeny survival and sex ratio, did not differ from controls even when parental host eggs were stored for 60 d at -20 °C, but the sex ratio was reduced by storage for 15 d at -80 °C. Parasitoid storage as pupae at either 6 °C or 8 °C for 0 to 28 d (with 2 h daily at 27 °C) had no effect on 24-h fecundity, percent parasitism, or sex ratio, but survival declined with storage time, falling to ca. 30% and 50% after 28 d at 6 °C and 8 °C, respectively. Progeny sex ratio of the F2 generation declined progressively with storage duration at 6 °C, but not at 8 °C, whereas other fitness measures were unaffected. We conclude that the use of frozen host eggs and refrigerated pupae could facilitate the rearing and augmentation of P. saccharicola against stink bug pests of pistachio.",
    "Evaluating the effectiveness of caffeine-based baits against two pest ant species.. Lee CC, Lin PC, Lin CC (2026). The black cocoa ant, Dolichoderus thoracicus (Smith, 1860) (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) is a pest species capable of reaching high population densities in diverse habitats. In Taiwan, infestations are associated with intrusions into residential homes, damage to electrical equipment, and decreased agricultural productivity. Although baiting programs using borax-based or boric acid-based ant baits have been implemented, these efforts often yield unsatisfactory results. This study evaluated the potential of caffeine, a naturally occurring bioactive compound, as an active ingredient in ant baits for controlling D. thoracicus and Anoplolepis gracilipes (Smith, 1857). Laboratory bioassays demonstrated that hydrogel baits containing 1.0% caffeine resulted in 100% worker mortality in D. thoracicus colony fragments within 15 days (mean survival time = 3.06 days) and complete queen mortality within 5 days (mean = 2.89 days), outperforming baits containing 0.5%, 1.5% caffeine, or 3.0% borax. These findings demonstrate that the exceptionally high attractiveness of a 1.0% caffeine bait can induce substantial worker mortality through direct consumption, leading to complete elimination of laboratory colonies of D. thoracicus despite limited trophallaxis. Additionally, the 1.0% caffeine bait was also highly effective against A. gracilipes. In conclusion, ant bait formulated with an intermediate dose of caffeine provides an optimal balance between bait acceptance and toxicity, making it a promising tool for managing D. thoracicus and other pest ant species, although further field validation is warranted.",
    "Potential of Beauveria bassiana in the control of Euschistus crenator (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) and selectivity to the parasitoid Telenomus podisi (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae).. da Silva PHM, Carneiro GA, Polanczyk RA (2026). BACKGROUND: The combination of entomopathogenic fungi (EPFs) with natural enemies represents a promising strategy for more sustainable management programs within the context of integrated pest management (IPM). This study aimed to evaluate the pathogenicity of EPF isolates on 2nd-instar nymphs of Euschistus crenator, through daily mortality and estimation of lethal time, in addition to investigating the selectivity of the most efficient isolates with respect to the egg parasitoid Telenomus podisi, an important natural enemy of stink bugs in soybean crops. RESULTS: All isolates were pathogenic to E. crenator, with LCMAP106, UFSM-01, and the commercial strain PL63 (BOV) of Beauveria bassiana promoting 83.75%, 75% and 87.5% mortality, respectively, after 10 days. The biological parameters of the offspring of females of T. podisi exposed to these isolates were evaluated. The exposure did not affect parasitism or survival, although it did influence the sex ratio, emergence and egg-to-adult cycle. This study also confirmed, for the first time, the parasitism of E. crenator eggs by T. podisi. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate the potential of different fungal isolates in controlling E. crenator and indicate that T. podisi can be used in conjunction with EPFs, as its ability to parasitize pest eggs and interrupt their biological cycle was not affected. © 2026 The Author(s).

    "Drivers and consequences of nest ectoparasite pressure in tit nestlings.. Arce SI, Garrido-Bautista J, Cascão CG, Vilhena ISC, Arjona JM, Cabral AR, Marengo F, Girão J, Moreno-Rueda G, Ramos JA, Norte AC (2025). Ectoparasites impose significant costs to their hosts and modulate their life-history traits. We evaluated the prevalence and abundance of louse flies, blowflies, fleas and mites in great tits (Parus major) and blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) breeding in nest boxes in Central Portugal during two consecutive breeding seasons and assessed: (a) the potential physiological consequences of infestation for nestlings; (b) how nest box re-use and presence of anthropogenic materials in nests affected the ectoparasite abundance; (c) how host reproductive parameters were related to ectoparasitism; and (d) how different nest-dwelling arthropod groups, including ectoparasites, and their diversity correlated. Tit nestlings reared in nests with more blowflies showed symptoms of anaemia, such as lower haemoglobin levels and high erythrocyte maturation index, and tended to grow less. Nestlings from nests with higher number of obligatory parasitic mites had increased polychromasia, and blue tits tended to have lower probability to fledge. Great tit nestlings from nests with fleas also had increased polychromasia compared with those from non-infested nests. Nest box re-use increased the probability of infestation by louse flies and obligatory parasitic mites. In both tit species, broods that were reared later in the season had higher abundance of blowflies and obligatory parasitic mites in their nests. In great tit nests, anthropogenic materials were negatively correlated with flea abundance, and positively correlated with the abundance of Histeridae coleopterans. In great and blue tit nests, obligatory parasitic mites were less abundant when nests showed a higher abundance of Staphylinidae coleopterans and Collembola. Overall, this study shows strong negative effects of nest ectoparasite pressure, particularly blowflies and obligatory parasitic mites, on physiological and fitness measures of hole nesting birds.",
    "Early multimodal behavioral cues in autism: a micro-analytical exploration of actions, gestures and speech during naturalistic parent-child interactions.. Mastrogiuseppe M, Famà FI, Bruschetta R, Leonardi E, Campisi A, Aiello S, Carrozza C, Ruggeri A, Baieli S, Campisi S, Turriziani L, Di Rosa G, Lombardo MV, Tartarisco G, Capirci O, Pioggia G, Ruta L, Nest Team (2026). Early signs of autism often emerge through distinct developmental pathways, particularly in communication, social interaction, and play. While naturalistic parent-child interactions during free play are ideal for observing spontaneous social behaviors, few autism studies have adopted this ecological and developmental approach. To address this gap, we used a fine-grained microanalytic method to examine motor, gestural, and vocal behaviors in young children, integrating machine learning to explore how combinations of these traits distinguish early autistic neurodivergence. We analyzed video recordings of 58 autistic and non-autistic children (aged 13-40 months) engaged in naturalistic parent-child play. A frame-by-frame micro-coding scheme was applied to capture actions, gestures, speech, and their multimodal integration. Clear differences emerged between neurotypical (NT) and autistic (ASC) children. NT children displayed more gestures, particularly deictic and conventional-interactive, greater gesture-gaze coordination, more functional object play, and more frequent multi-word utterances. In contrast, ASC children showed fewer deictic and conventional-interactive gestures and greater use of instrumental gestures, reduced gesture-gaze coordination, a higher reliance on vocalizations rather than words, and increased object manipulation compared to functional play. Feature selection using ANOVA F-tests identified a core set of key predictors most frequently and independently selected across folds of cross-validation: Alternate Gaze, Reaching, and Instrumental Gesture. Higher values of Alternate Gaze were associated with NT classification, while elevated frequencies of Reaching and Instrumental Gestures were linked to ASC classification. A logistic regression classifier trained on these features achieved over 85% accuracy in distinguishing the two groups. These findings underscore the value of an ecologically valid, and developmentally informed approach to identifying early behavioral markers of autism, supporting earlier recognition and the design of more personalized, strengths-based interventions.",
    "Environmental fungal contamination on the fur of healthy captive meerkats: Implications for human health.. Chupia V, Suriyasathaporn W, Nomsiri R, Pirintr P (2025). BACKGROUND: Meerkats (Suricata suricatta), which belong to the suborder Feliformia, are commonly found in zoos and are increasingly kept as exotic pets. Owing to their close contact with humans, there is concern regarding their potential role as reservoirs for zoonotic fungi, particularly dermatophytes. However, data on fungal species associated with the skin and fur of meerkats remain limited. AIM: To identify dermatophytes and other fungal species present on the skin and fur of meerkats at Chiang Mai Night Safari, Chiang Mai, Thailand, in 2022, which may have implications for human health. METHODS: Skin and fur samples were collected from 21 meerkats using the brushing/McKenzie technique. Samples were cultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar at 25°C for 14 days. Fungal identification was based on both macroscopic characteristics (colony morphology, color, and texture) and microscopic features observed in lactophenol cotton blue-stained teased mount preparations. This study aimed to detect dermatophytes and identify other potential fungal contaminants at the genus level. RESULTS: No dermatophytes were detected. However, various other fungi, including Aspergillus spp. (61.9%), Cladosporium spp. (52.38%), and Penicillium spp. (28.57%), were found. CONCLUSION: Predominant fungal contamination was observed on the skin and fur of meerkats. Some identified fungal species are associated with diseases in humans, which can vary in severity based on immune status. Therefore, keeping meerkats as pets is not recommended in homes with children, older adults, or immunocompromised individuals.",
    "The ameliorative effects of Myrmecodia sp. as an antibiotic growth promoter in broiler chicken with avian pathogenic Escherichia coli infection.. Lisnanti EF, Lokapirnasari WP, Al-Arif MA, Hestianah EP, Hidanah S, Moses IB, Yuliani MGA, Baihaqi ZA, Dameanti FNAEP, Khairullah AR, Hendrawan VF, Rehman S (2025). BACKGROUND: Broiler livestock supports the fulfillment of animal protein in a country where the meat price is affordable for the wider population. However, its progress faces numerous challenges, with colibacillosis, induced by APEC, being a significant concern due to its detrimental impact on production levels, as evidenced by elevated morbidity and mortality rates. Exploring natural antibacterial substances, such as ant nest extracts, presents promising avenues for combating APEC. AIM: This study investigated the potential of Myrmecodia sp. extract as a natural feed additive to improve performance and immune responses in APEC-challenged broiler chickens. METHODS: The effects of varying concentrations of Myrmecodia extract (15% and 30%) at 0.1% concentration and infusions (1% and 2%) were evaluated against a zinc bacitracin control using a completely randomized design with seven treatments and four replications. Growth performance indicators, including feed intake, total body weight, feed conversion ratio (FCR), feed efficiency, and immune markers (leukocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes, granulocytes, erythrocytes, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelets, malondialdehyde, and superoxide dismutase levels) were measured. RESULTS: Results showed that 15% extract improved FCR by 1.47%, while 30% extract further boosted feed intake and weight gain. Infusion treatments also demonstrated positive effects: the 20 ml infusion improved FCR and stabilized leukocyte and platelet counts, while the 10 ml infusion enhanced overall performance, reduced blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels, and positively impacted lipid profiles. CONCLUSION: Myrmecodia sp. has the potential to serve as a natural alternative to antibiotic growth promoters in broiler production. However, these results should be interpreted with caution, and further confirmation is required.",
    "Tachinid endoparasitoid flies do not rely on domesticated viruses, unlike multiple hymenopteran lineages.. Oukkal S, Guinet B, Hebert PDN, Janzen D, Hallwachs W, Fleming AJ, Charlat S, Varaldi J (2026). Viral domestication, the co-option of integrated viral genes for host functions, has been repeatedly documented in endoparasitoid Hymenoptera. Whether this phenomenon extends to other parasitoid insects remains to be assessed. Here, we tested this hypothesis in tachinid flies, the largest group of non-hymenopteran parasitoids. To this end, we investigated patterns of viral endogenization in 52 genomes, including 37 newly sequenced species. Similarly to hymenopteran endoparasitoids, tachinid genomes were found to display numerous endogenous viral elements (EVEs), primarily derived from insect-infecting viruses with either DNA or RNA genomes. However, the majority of integrated sequences were species-specific, with no evidence of major ancient gene domestication events. In addition, the EVE content did not differ between dipteran parasitoids and their free-living Diptera counterparts. These findings contrast with the recurrent viral domestication observed in endoparasitoid Hymenoptera. This pattern is discussed in light of important attributes of tachinid flies including their lack of venom and perforating ovipositor, and their avoidance of the host immune system.",
    "20(R)-Ginsenoside Rg3 Suppresses P-Glycoprotein-Mediated Multidrug Resistance in A549/Taxol Cells by Targeting MDM2-IκB-α Signaling Axis.. Yang Y, Zhang W, Xie Z, Gao Y, Zheng Y, Li Z, Xu X, Zuo D (2026). Overexpression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells is one of the primary causes of multidrug resistance (MDR), but the molecular mechanism remains obscure. Murine double minute 2 (MDM2) has been implicated in drug resistance across multiple cancer types. In this study, we investigated the potential mechanism of MDM2 on P-gp-mediated MDR of NSCLC and explored the potential therapeutic effects of 20(R)-ginsenoside Rg3 (Rg3). Western blot, RT-PCR, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were applied to analyze the expression of critical signaling markers. The drug accumulation in resistant cells was measured using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Bioinformatics analysis, co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP), and immunofluorescence were conducted to confirm the protein-protein interactions. MTT, colony formation, EdU, and in vivo cell line derived xenograft (CDX) models were applied to validate therapeutic agents and molecular mechanisms. We demonstrated that MDM2 acted as a positive upstream regulator of P-gp, and the inhibition of MDM2 by Rg3 increased the sensitivity of resistant cells to taxol treatment both in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, we uncovered that MDM2 bound to IκB-α, facilitating its ubiquitination degradation, which subsequently promoted NF-κB pathway activation to drive the high expression of P-gp. Notably, Rg3 blocked this process by inhibiting MDM2. Moreover, interference with the NF-κB pathway reversed the regulation of P-gp expression by MDM2. Our findings elucidate the molecular mechanisms of Rg3 in the treatment of P-gp-mediated MDR in NSCLC. This study also provides a new strategy to overcome P-gp-mediated MDR by inhibiting the MDM2-IκB-α signaling axis.",
    "Coagulation factor V as a novel regulator of tumor immunity in melanoma.. Wang Z, Shi H, Zhuang M, Li J, Zhang C, Li N, Jiang G (2026). BACKGROUND: Recent advances in melanoma treatment, including targeted therapies and immunotherapies, have improved patient outcomes. The discovery of molecular targets is crucial, enabling more precise treatment strategies that address specific genetic mutations. Our study delves into the multifunctional role of coagulation factor Coagulation Factor V (F5) in melanoma. METHODS: The melanoma data about gene expression, clinical information, prognosis, and immune infiltration were obtained from TCGA database. The A2058 cell were used to examine the effects of F5 in the behavior of tumor cells in vitro. RESULTS: Our results revealed that F5 expression levels in melanoma patients are significantly correlated with prognosis, with lower expression levels associated with poorer outcomes. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis further revealed a strong association between F5 expression and diverse immune cell populations and chemokines. In addition, overexpression of F5 in the melanoma cell line A2058 significantly inhibited cell migration, proliferation, and colony formation capacity, while upregulating the expression of multiple immune chemokines. CONCLUSIONS: These findings go beyond the traditional view of F5 as a coagulation factor and reveal its importance in immunomodulation and tumor biology.",
    "Displacement threatens local knowledge: plant foraging in a cross-cultural context in the Gomal area, NW Pakistan.. Aziz MA, Malik A, Hasan M, Abidullah S, Ullah A, Ullah Z, Abbasi AM, Pieroni A (2026). In the context of human displacement, it is essential to study how local knowledge is reshaped, eroded, or transformed. This study sheds light on how wild plant reports are articulated after migration, retained, and kept; the research explores specifically the ethnobotanical knowledge linked to wild food plants of five ethnic communities, namely the Bettani, Ormur, Mehsud, and Miani populations living in the Gomal area of NW Pakistan, of which three are displaced communities. The study aims to record the knowledge of wild food plants and their use among generations in these communities. To better determine the impact of displacement, we have analysed the data along two trajectories: (a) cross-geographically comparing the recorded wild food plant reports with the available published literature in NW Pakistan and (b) conducting a cross-cultural comparison of the local plant knowledge among the considered groups (displaced ones: Mehsud, Ormur, and Powanda; autochthonous: Bettani and Miani) residing in the Gomal area. Via semi-structured interviews with a hundred study participants (twenty for each ethic group), the study revealed the use of 69 wild food taxa, showing a remarkable diversity of food uses, with Ormur and Powanda exhibiting several idiosyncratic reports. The research highlights that displacement may have disrupted potential pathways of knowledge transmission among the Mehsud, Ormur, and Powanda; however, local plant knowledge about their past environment remains part of the collective memory of these communities. Moreover, post-migration exposure to a new ecological system has become a challenge for the newcomers, necessitating adaptation to rearticulate their relationship with nature and plants. The broken paths have a profound impact on plant knowledge transmission to youngsters, as social structures and gatherings have been significantly altered or disrupted; these were the primary means of interaction between youngsters and their elders. The exposure to urbanisation compounds the issue of displacement, and the erosion of knowledge systems has come at the expense of hands-on experiences among the selected groups. Notably, the local plant nomenclature of Ormur is also highly threatened. We advocate incorporating local plant knowledge into local educational curricula, which may be crucial for the sustainability of natural knowledge and have profound impacts on mitigating the effects of socioecological change.",
    "Synergistic Influence of Bacterial Proliferation and EPS Secretion on Porous Media.. Zhu Y, Wang Q, Lu Y, Ma S, Wu Y (2026). Bio-clogging is critical to the efficiency of soil aquifer treatment. In this study, we utilized a percolation column device to investigate the dynamic evolution of biofilm and the corresponding responses changes of three typical hydraulic properties with the column within the percolation column. The results showed that the biofilm development exhibited five-stage growth morphology: bacterial stage, colony stage, biofilm with filamentous EPS stage, biofilm with mesh EPS stage, and dense biofilm stage. The hydraulic conductivity exhibited nonuniform decay across five stages: initial fluctuation period, swiftly declining period, accelerated declining period, gently decreasing period, and equilibrium stabilizing period. Both bacteria and EPS contribute to the attenuation of the infiltration properties. Due to its hydrophilic nature, EPS played a more prominent role in storing and dispersing water. As such, significant changes in water holding capacity and material transport mechanism occurred at EPS secretion onset. From 0-18 h, bacterial colonization slightly enhanced water retention, accompanied by a gradual rise in the hydraulic dispersion coefficient. After approximately 18 h, substantial EPS production markedly increased water-holding capacity and transformed the dominant transport mechanism from convection to dispersion.",
    "Sleep and infant development in the first year.. O'Connor C, Ventura S, Proietti J, O'Sullivan MP, Boylan GB, Neonatal Sleep Talks (NEST) group (2026). The trajectory of sleep in the first year of age is highly dynamic and correlates with developmental progress from the neonatal to the infantile period. During this critical period of brain growth, sleep facilitates neural maturation and memory consolidation. This review article examines the current evidence regarding the relationship between sleep and neurodevelopment in the first year of age. Over the first year, total sleep time decreases, nocturnal sleep consolidates with less nocturnal awakenings, and daytime sleep decreases. The dominant sleep state shifts from active sleep in neonates to non-rapid eye movement sleep at 12 months. Specific electroencephalogram (EEG) features include tracé alternant in neonates and sleep spindles and K complexes in infants. Characteristics of sleep spindles serve as biomarkers for neurodevelopmental outcomes. Adequate sleep duration is associated with enhanced white matter development. Healthy sleep parameters are linked to improved memory, language, executive function, sensorimotor skills, and overall cognitive development, whereas abnormal sleep during infancy is associated with cognitive, behavioral, and emotional disturbances. Developmental brain disorders and certain medical conditions are also associated with sleep disruption, indicating a bidirectional relationship. Sleep evolves rapidly in the first year of age, and adequate quantity and quality of sleep are critical for neurodevelopment. IMPACT: Sleep evolves significantly and rapidly during the first year, serving critical and active processes for neuromaturation. These sleep changes occur concurrently with major neurodevelopmental progress. Certain medical conditions, environmental exposures, and socioeconomic factors can disrupt sleep, potentially resulting in neurodevelopmental delay. Additionally, neurodevelopmental disorders are frequently associated with disruption in normal sleep architecture, suggesting a bidirectional relationship between sleep disruption and abnormal neurodevelopment. Future research should explore the neurodevelopmental consequences of medical and socioeconomic conditions that disrupt sleep. It is also essential to identify interventions to mitigate cognitive and behavioral disturbance arising from sleep disruption and to protect sleep health.",
    "Improving precision agriculture using integrated bio-inspired optimization models for crop recommendation in Rajasthan, India.. Goel L, Kumar N, Jain S, Agrawal Y (2026). This study introduces two novel hybrid nature-inspired optimization algorithms designed to enhance artificial neural network (ANN) performance in crop recommendation, leveraging remote sensing data from Landsat 8 and 9 platforms. The first hybrid approach combines the Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) with the Hunger Games Search (HGS) algorithm, promoting an improved balance between exploration and exploitation through gravitational dynamics and competitive resource-seeking strategies. The second hybrid integrates Electric Eel Foraging Optimization (EEFO) with Crested Porcupine Optimization (CPO), leveraging the foraging adaptability of electric eels and the defensive spatial strategies of crested porcupines to refine search efficiency and convergence stability. These hybrid algorithms were applied to classify crops across Kharif and Rabi seasons in Rajasthan, India. Experimental results reveal that the GSA-HGS hybrid achieves classification accuracies of 95.32% for Kharif and 94.99% for Rabi seasons, while the EEFO-CPO hybrid attains 94.09% and 94.94%, respectively. These findings demonstrate the potential of bio-inspired optimization strategies to support intelligent crop recommendation systems and advance precision agriculture practices in data-scarce agricultural regions.",
    "A conjugal gene drive-like system efficiently suppresses antibiotic resistance in a bacterial population.. Kaduwal S, Stuart EC, Auradkar A, Washabaugh S, Meyer JR, Bier E (2026). Antibiotic resistance (AR) is an escalating public health threat, necessitating innovative strategies to control resistant bacterial populations. One promising approach involves engineering genetic elements that can spread within microbial communities to eliminate AR genes. Previously, we developed Pro-Active Genetics (Pro-AG), a CRISPR-based gene-drive-like system capable of reducing AR colony-forming units (CFU) by approximately five logs. Here, we advance this technology by integrating Pro-AG into a conjugative transfer system, enabling efficient dissemination of an anti-AR gene cassette between two bacterial strains. Additionally, we characterize a complementary homology-based deletion (HBD) process, a CRISPR-driven mechanism that precisely removes target DNA sequences flanked by short direct repeats. Our findings reveal that Pro-AG and HBD are differentially influenced by the bacterial RecA pathway and that HBD components can be delivered via plasmids or phages to selectively delete Pro-AG cassettes. This built-in safeguard prevents uncontrolled spread of a gene cassette and mitigates unanticipated side effects. These refinements enhance the efficiency and flexibility of Pro-AG, expanding its potential applications in microbiome engineering, environmental remediation, and clinical interventions aimed at combating antibiotic resistance. More broadly, this work establishes a proof-of-principle for microbiome engineering strategies that could be leveraged to improve health and restore ecological balance.",
    "Decoding the chemical burden: 2020-2025 insights into pesticide toxicity, risk assessment, mitigation strategies, and future prospects in honey bees (Apis spp.).. Singh S, Zexian C, Mehboob F, Wu S (2026). Honey bees are vital ecological and economic pollinators whose services and hive-derived products support global food production and ecosystem health. However, their populations have declined sharply in recent decades, with pesticides emerging as one of the most critical chemical stressors. Although multiple bee taxa exhibit species-specific sensitivities to pesticides, the present review focuses specifically on honey bees (Apis spp.) and synthesizes studies published between 2020 and 2025 to evaluate the detrimental impacts of pesticides on honey bee health and the underlying mechanisms. We summarize the major environmental exposure pathways and the key toxicity processes, including acute and chronic effects, neurotoxicity, oxidative stress, immunosuppression and transcriptomic and epigenetic alterations. These molecular and physiological disruptions, collectively, contribute to colony-level consequences such as impaired foraging behavior or memory, reduced reproductive fitness, brood abnormalities, and eventual colony collapse. We also examine how pesticide exposure interacts synergistically with other environmental stressors such as pathogens, poor nutrition, and climate extremes. Recent advances in detection and risk assessment, including omics-based biomarkers and computational models, are also highlighted, alongside key strategies that can be implemented to mitigate pesticide impacts. By integrating the most recent multidisciplinary evidence, this review provides an updated, comprehensive framework that identifies critical knowledge gaps and outlines future research priorities essential for safeguarding pollinators in an era of increasing chemical and environmental pressures.",
    "Chronic neonicotinoid exposure disrupts survival, development, digestive enzymes, and gut microbiome in honeybee queen larvae (Apis mellifera L.).. Gao Q, Wu Y, Huang J, Xu S, Chen R, Jiang H, Huang Y, He Q, Wang Y, Xiao J, Cao H (2026). Honeybee queens (Apis mellifera L.) are essential for colony sustainability, most study mainly focused on the acute toxicity of chemical insecticides. This study investigated the chronic effects of three prevalent neonicotinoids on honeybee queen larvae development, digestive physiology, and gut microbiota. It was determined that exposure to elevated concentrations (10-40 mg/L) significantly increased larval mortality (up to 41.70%), which reduced both capping and emergence rates, with imidacloprid causing a 43.80% decline in emergence at 40 mg/L. Chronic exposure (1-25 mg/L) to clothianidin notably decreased birth weight by 11.40% and altered thoracic and abdominal morphometrics. Moreover, imidacloprid and clothianidin suppressed amylase activity by up to 94%, while acetamiprid enhanced it by nearly 60%. Additionally, 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed significant shifts in gut microbiota composition, characterized by increased abundance of Firmicutes and decreased Bacteroidota, despite minor changes in overall diversity. Functional predictions indicated alterations in carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and membrane transport pathways. These findings demonstrate that chronic neonicotinoid exposure disrupts metabolic and microbial homeostasis in honeybee queen larvae, posing a serious threat to honeybee colony fitness, which is important and provides essential evidence for ecological risk assessment and the development of safer pesticide application strategies in apiculture and crop protection.",
    "Isolation, characterization, and host specificity of Solenopsis invicta virus 6 (Cripavirus porteri), a dicistrovirus from the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta.. Valles SM, Zhao C, Porter SD, Becnel JJ (2026). Solenopsis invicta virus 6 (SINV-6; Cripavirus porteri) is a recently discovered dicistrovirus from the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta. SINV-6 was detected in all stages of S. invicta including eggs, pupae, larvae, adult workers, male and female sexual alates, and queens. Electron microscopic examination of negatively stained samples from particles purified from SINV-6-infected fire ant workers revealed isometric particles with a mean diameter of 34.2 ± 2.1 nm. Field surveys of S. invicta nests in Alachua County, Florida, showed that the virus was present year-round. SINV-6 nest prevalence ranged from 37.5% in February to 100% in November. Among 171 nests surveyed throughout the year and over the 6-year period, 106 (62%) tested positive for SINV-6. Intra-colonial SINV-6 infection incidence and virus titer among worker ants exhibited a positive relationship. SINV-6 exhibited tissue tropism toward the abdomen where > 99% of SINV-6 was detected. Among the major tissues of the abdomen, the alimentary canal (crop, midgut, hindgut) contained 87.6% of SINV-6 with the midgut and hindgut accounting for 58.0 ± 28.7% of the total. Small quantities of SINV-6 were detected in fat body (8.4 ± 0.4%) and Malpighian tubules (4.0 ± 0.4%). SINV-6 infection did not have a significant impact on brood production in S. invicta over a 26-day period when held in the laboratory compared with uninfected control colonies. The host range of SINV-6 appears to be broad with the plus genome strand detected in six species of ants and the honey bee (Apis mellifera).",
    "Integrated transcriptomic analysis reveals mitochondrial dysregulation and macrophage heterogeneity associated with MTHFD2 in glioblastoma.. Tu B, Ji Y, Tan Z, Cheng S, Zhang Y (2026). BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive brain tumor with therapeutic resistance and poor prognosis. Mitochondrial dysfunction has emerged as a critical driver of tumor progression and immune modulation, yet mitochondrial gene alterations and their cellular specificity in GBM remain unclear. METHODS: Transcriptomic datasets (TCGA-GBM, GSE66354) were analyzed to identify differentially expressed mitochondria-associated genes using MitoCarta3.0. Prognostic mitochondrial DEGs (MitoDEGs) were determined by Cox regression, and a nomogram was constructed for survival prediction. Single-cell RNA sequencing was applied to explore mitochondrial gene expression in cellular populations, particularly macrophages. Functional enrichment and pseudotime analyses were conducted to define macrophage subpopulations, while in vitro assays validated the role of MTHFD2 in glioblastoma cell behavior, macrophage migration and the expression of IL-6 and CCL2. RESULTS: MTHFD2 was identified as a diagnosis mitochondrial hub gene strongly correlated with GBM diagnosis. Single-cell analysis revealed elevated mitochondrial activity and MTHFD2 expression in tumor-associated macrophages. A distinct MTHFD2-high macrophage subpopulation displayed immune-activated and metabolically reprogrammed pathways, representing a terminally differentiated state linked to tumor progression. Functional assays showed that silencing MTHFD2 suppressed glioblastoma cell proliferation, invasion, colony formation, and reduced macrophage migration and the expression of IL-6 and CCL2. CONCLUSION: Mitochondrial dysfunction mediated by MTHFD2 in macrophages plays a key role in GBM progression and immune heterogeneity. MTHFD2 represents a potential diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for modulating GBM immune infiltration.",
    "Antibacterial and mineralising properties of silver complex fluoride on enamel caries: An in vitro study.. Xu GY, Yin IX, Zhao IS, Lung CY, Lo EC, Chu CH (2026). OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the antibacterial and mineralising effects of silver complex fluoride (SCF) on enamel. METHODS: Sound human enamel blocks were prepared and subjected to Streptococcus mutans-induced demineralisation to create artificial caries. Blocks were treated with SCF, 38% silver diamine fluoride (SDF), or deionised water and underwent a 21-day pH-cycling. Biofilm morphology, viability, and quantification were analysed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), and colony-forming unit (CFU) counting. Remineralisation effects were assessed by SEM, micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), Knoop microhardness, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). RESULTS: SEM images showed dense bacterial biofilm on water-treated enamel, but minimal growth on SCF- or SDF-treated surfaces. CLSM indicated higher dead/live cell ratios in SCF (0.75 ± 0.22) and SDF (0.83 ± 0.25) groups than water (0.43 ± 0.22; p < 0.001). Log CFU values for SCF, SDF, and water were 6.90 ± 0.09, 6.74 ± 0.23, and 7.78 ± 0.13, respectively (p < 0.001, SCF, SDF < Water). Lesion depths (μm) were 91 ± 36, 89 ± 24, and 186 ± 34 (p < 0.001; SCF, SDF < Water), while mineral loss (gHA pcm⁻³) was 0.43 ± 0.13, 0.40 ± 0.14, and 1.32 ± 0.21 (p < 0.001; SCF, SDF < Water) for SCF, SDF, and water, respectively. Knoop hardness was significantly higher in SCF (70 ± 2) and SDF (72 ± 7) than water (25 ± 6; p < 0.05). XRD confirmed well-crystallised hydroxyapatite in SCF- and SDF-treated enamel but not in water-treated samples. CONCLUSION: SCF demonstrates antibacterial and mineralising properties comparable to SDF. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Adoption of SCF may expand silver-based caries prevention by improving patient acceptance without compromising appearance.",
    "In Vitro and In Planta Evaluation of Bacillus Strains Against a Strain of Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli in Mung Bean Sprouts.. Chahar M, Kroupitski Y, Gollop R, Shemesh M, Sela Saldinger S (2026). Edible sprouts, including mung bean sprouts, are nutritionally valuable but have frequently been associated with foodborne outbreaks. Control measures like seed disinfection have not fully prevented outbreaks. This study evaluated the ability of spore-forming Bacillus strains isolated from mung bean sprouts to inhibit E. coli O55:H7 colonization during seed sprouting. Several Bacillus isolates added to the germinating seeds reduced E. coli populations in sprouts by 4.0-5.4 log CFU/g compared to untreated controls. While some strains impacted sprout growth, highly antagonistic isolates, such as MBm1 and MBm6, demonstrated robust activity with no adverse effects. Notably, in vitro antagonistic activity on agar plate did not consistently predict inhibition of E. coli in sprout colonization assays, whereas colony morphology was a better predictor for in planta activity. Bacillus strains formed complex biofilms on agar and sprout surfaces, suggesting biofilm-mediated antagonism. Fluorescence microscopy confirmed reduced E. coli attachment and growth in the presence of antagonistic Bacillus strains. These findings indicate that Bacillus strains may serve as effective biocontrol agents to enhance sprout safety, and that multistrain formulations may be required for broader protection. Further research is needed to validate efficacy against diverse pathogens under commercial conditions.",
    "Scorpio fuscus venom as a promising anticancer agent against colorectal cancer.. Karakurt S, Gokcek-Sarac C, Kandir S, Bilgiseven IM, Yagmur EA, Celebioglu HU (2026). Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, underscoring the urgent need for novel and effective therapeutic agents. Conventional treatments, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery, are often associated with significant adverse effects, prompting the exploration of alternative therapeutic strategies. This study aimed to evaluate the anticancer effects of Scorpio fuscus venom (SFV) on human colorectal cancer models using integrated in vitro and in vivo approaches. SFV constituents were characterized using gel electrophoresis, followed by high-performance liquid chromatography and UV-visible spectrometry. Identified peptides were subjected to structural modeling and in silico docking analyses against selected proteins associated with colorectal cancer and apoptosis-related pathways. The cytotoxic effects of SFV were assessed in human CRC cell lines (DLD-1, HT-29, and CaCo-2) and a healthy colon epithelial cell line (CCD-18Co) using Alamar Blue assays after 48-h treatment, and half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC₅₀) values were determined. SFV treatment resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in cancer cell viability, accompanied by decreased migratory capacity and colony formation ability. Apoptotic responses were further evaluated by flow cytometry and gene expression analyses, indicating modulation of apoptosis-associated genes. For in vivo validation, subcutaneous and orthotopic xenograft colon cancer models were established in mice. SFV administration led to reduced tumor growth compared with control groups. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed altered expression patterns of selected tumor-related markers in SFV-treated tumors. Gene expression profiling demonstrated ≥ twofold changes in 51 genes, including downregulation of BAK1 and TRAF3, and upregulation of BIRC2, BIRC3, BIRC6, CASP8, TNFRSF8, TNFRSF11, and BOK. Collectively, these findings indicate that SFV exerts significant antitumor effects in colorectal cancer models and support its potential as a promising anticancer agent, warranting further mechanistic and translational investigation.",
    "Effect of Stockholm Convention Listing on Temporal Trends of Halogenated Flame Retardants in Herring Gull Eggs in Canada (2008-2023).. Vanderlip HL, Hughes KD, Orihel DM, Friesen VL, R de Solla S, Letcher RJ, Martin PA, Lavoie RA, Eng ML, Provencher JF (2026). Halogenated flame retardants (HFRs) are chemical additives used in many household and commercial products. Due to their persistence, long-range transport, bioaccumulative potential, and toxicity, several HFRs were listed for elimination or restrictions under the international Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (SC-POPs). To understand how levels of HFRs in the environment have changed since being listed under the SC-POPs, herring gull (Larus argentatus) eggs were collected from 17 colonies across Canada (Laurentian Great Lakes, Niagara and St. Lawrence rivers, and Atlantic and Arctic regions) from 2008-2023. Eggs were analyzed for SC-POPs-listed HFRs; total-α-hexabromocyclododecane (HBCDD), Σpolybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs; sum concentration of 11 tri- to hepta-BDE congeners), BDE-209, and ΣDechlorane Plus (DP; sum concentration of syn- and anti-isomers). Overall, no significant temporal changes in concentrations of the four target classes of HFRs were found for most comparisons across colonies (75%, 51/68). Significant declines were found for 13% of class-colony comparisons while BDE-209 concentrations increased significantly at one colony. Evidence of a significant influence of the SC-POPs on concentrations was equivocal, with 6% of trends declining with the year of nomination, year of listing, or before the year of nomination, and 4% of trends showing increases. Despite more than a decade of regulation for some of these compounds, herring gulls continue to be exposed to HFRs, presumably from sources such as stockpiles, discarded products, or re-release from environmental reservoirs. Continued multi-site monitoring of HFRs is required to fully assess the effectiveness of regulations that may take several decades to show consistent evidence of reduced exposure in gulls.",
    "The virulence regulator Rv3425 mediates stress adaptation and promotes intracellular survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosis avirulent strain.. Zhu W, Reheman A, Dang G, Wang Y, Cai H, Yang X, Liu M, Naeem MA, Chen X (2026). Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis), the etiological agent responsible for tuberculosis, possesses a gene family encoding proteins characterized by Pro-Glu/Pro-Pro-Glu motifs, collectively referred to as the PE/PPE family. Despite being a member of this family, the biological function of Rv3425, which encodes PPE57, remains poorly understood. In the current study, we investigated the role of Rv3425 in stress adaption in vitro and in the virulence of M. tuberculosis avirulent strain in cellular and murine infection models. We found that Rv3425 enhances the stress resistance of M. tuberculosis under conditions of 0.05% SDS, pH3.0 or hydrogen peroxide treatment in vitro. The knockout of rv3425 resulted in a phenotypic alteration of the mycobacterial colony morphology from the typical rough and dry appearance to an atypical smooth and moist phenotype. Further, Rv3425 localizes to the host cell nucleus, the knockout of rv3425 attenuated the survival of M. tuberculosis in THP-1 cells and in C57BL/6 mice. The transcriptional analysis identified 1370 differentially expressed genes that were enriched in cytokines production and associated signaling pathways. Notably, Rv3425 significantly suppressed the expression of IFN-α while promoting the expression of IFN-γ in infected mice. T-cell recall (IFN-γ) assay showed that Rv3425 substantially increased the antigenicity of M. tuberculosis. Altogether, we found that Rv3425 enhances survival of M. tuberculosis avirulent in macrophages and mice, and exerting immunomodulatory effects, indicating that Rv3425 is a potential target for the development of new diagnostic techniques or therapeutic strategies against tuberculosis.",
    "Stanford's Hopkins Marine Station: insights into the purpose, promise and peril of field stations.. Denny M (2026). Hopkins Marine Station, Stanford University's marine science center, exemplifies five attributes that could be said to characterize field stations in general: history, location, isolation, focus and fragility. Founded in 1892, the Marine Station has a long history of notable research on subjects ranging from the biochemistry of photosynthesis to developmental biology, intertidal ecology and comparative physiology. Five Nobel laureates have been influenced by classes they attended at Hopkins, and the nearly 700 undergraduate research projects conducted at the Marine Station have sparked seminal studies on subjects as disparate as marine pollution and climate change. Current research spans topics from environmental DNA to the conservation of fisheries and the biomechanics of foraging whales. The Marine Station's scientific and educational goals are facilitated by its location on the edge of Monterey Bay and its isolation from the university's main campus, which combine to encourage a sense of intellectual community and a productive focus on the marine environment and its inhabitants. However, Hopkins' location and isolation do pose their own risks. As with most field stations, isolation from the main campus has at times made the Marine Station vulnerable to closure when money was tight, and owing to its proximity to the shore, sea-level rise poses an existential threat. In these times of rapid environmental and societal change, it is important to recognize both the value and the fragility of field institutions such as Hopkins Marine Station.",
    "Oxidizing pollutants can disrupt nestmate recognition in ants.. Jiang NJ, Bhat BA, Briceño-Aguilar E, Lehmann A, Ulrich Y, Hansson BS, Knaden M (2026). Eusocial hymenoptera recognize nestmates based on colony-specific profiles of cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs). While these profiles contain a variety of alkanes, the less abundant alkenes are crucial for nestmate recognition [F. R. Dani et al., Chem. Senses 30, 477-489 (2005)]. However, due to their carbon-carbon double bonds, alkenes can easily become degraded by oxidants. One of those oxidants, ozone, that usually reaches concentrations of 10 ppb in nonurban areas and ca 30 ppb in cities nowadays has been reported to often exceed 100 ppb in highly polluted regions, with levels above 200 ppb occasionally reported. Here, we show that short exposure to such elevated levels degrades alkenes in CHC profiles of all six investigated ant species and compromises nestmate recognition in five of them. Furthermore, a separate experiment with long-term exposure to such ozone levels corrupted brood care behavior within ant colonies, resulting in the death of larvae. The oxidizing pollutants like ozone have already been shown to corrupt interactions of flowers and their pollinators [B. Cook et al., J. Chem. Biol. 46, 987-996 (2020)] as well as sex pheromone communication in multiple species of flies [N. J. Jiang et al., Nat. Commun. 14 (2023)]. Our data suggest that the detrimental effects of oxidant pollutants may be even more far-reaching by jeopardizing the functionality of eusocial colonies.",
    "Loss of IL1RA promotes prostate cancer growth and metastasis by activating Akt signaling pathway.. Zhang C, Yu J, Ji T, Zhao K, Chen M (2026). BACKGROUND: Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL1RA) blocks the interaction between IL-1 and its receptors. It modulates inflammatory responses, cell proliferation, and the invasion of cancer cells. In this study, we examined the biological functions of IL1RA and the mechanisms that influence its effects on prostate cancer (PCa). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed RT-qPCR and Western blot analyses to evaluate IL1RA expression levels in various cell lines. For functional studies, we employed MTT, colony formation, soft agar, wound healing, and transwell migration and invasion assays. Then, we analyzed Western blots to elucidate the underlying mechanisms involved. Xenograft mouse models were ultimately established after the overexpression of IL1RA. RESULTS: IL1RA was expressed at higher levels in prostate epithelial cells compared with the PCa cell lines. BPH cells with lower IL1RA expression exhibited an increased cell proliferation. The PCa cell lines C4-2B and LNCap, which overexpressed IL1RA, demonstrated suppressed tumorigenic properties in vitro. The in vivo experiment demonstrated an inhibitory effect on tumor growth in xenograft mice. Furthermore, Western blot results indicated elevated phosphorylated AKT levels in BPH cells with IL1RA knockdown, and phosphorylated AKT and GSK-3[Formula: see text] levels were reduced in C4-2B and LNCap cells that overexpressed IL1RA. CONCLUSION: This study revealed that IL1RA low expression is associated with PCa progression. Our finding has great clinical and translational significance. The potential clinical application of IL1RA as a therapeutic target for PCa requires further investigation.",
    "Colonial signature of the alarm pheromone and chemical differences between hornet workers.. Haouzi M, Bastin F, Perdereau E, Humbert C, Play B, Beaugeard L, Darrouzet É (2026). The social organisation of eusocial insects is based on an effective communication system in which pheromones play a central role. Among these chemical compounds, the alarm pheromone is an essential component of colonial survival by inducing nestmates recruitment and defensive behaviours. In this study, we investigated the alarm pheromone composition produced in the venom gland of workers of the invasive Yellow-legged hornet Vespa velutina nigrithorax, focusing on two aspects: first, variations between different colonies, and second, differences related to the activities of workers in the colony at a given time. Here, we examined four specific activities: animal foragers, builders, defenders and material foragers. Our results reveal significant chemical heterogeneity in the alarm pheromone among workers, highlighting a strong colony-specific chemical signature as well as a variability linked to workers' activities. Notably, animal foragers and builders exhibited distinct pheromone profiles with discriminant chemical compounds. This study therefore suggests that the alarm pheromone could be used as a recognition signal in Vespidae species, both at the inter and intra-colonial levels. Such findings provide valuable insights into the chemical ecology of invasive species and open new perspectives on the role of pheromones in colony coordination and defense mechanisms.",
    "Nucleolar protein 6 as a potential oncogenic factor in colorectal cancer.. Song S, Zhang Y, Li L, Zhou K, Zhao Y, Yang Z, Guo S, He R, Zhang J (2026). BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common malignancy of the digestive tract associated with high mortality rates and significant invasive properties. Despite advancements in research, a comprehensive understanding of the regulatory mechanisms underlying CRC remains elusive. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the potential role of nucleolar protein 6 (NOL6) and its related genes as novel biomarkers for cell proliferation in CRC. The findings of this study could significantly contribute to early diagnosis and more effective therapeutic strategies for CRC. METHODS: Human CRC cell line HCT116 was cultured under standard conditions. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry analysis were used to measure NOL6 expression levels in CRC tissues. Cell proliferation was assessed using the MTT assay, Celigo cell count assay, and colony formation assays, while flow cytometry was employed to evaluate cell apoptosis. Additionally, a transwell migration assay was performed to evaluate CRC cell migration and invasion. Comprehensive proteomic and transcriptomic analyses were performed to identify the downstream genes and pathways affected by NOL6 knockdown. The expression of these genes was further validated by Western blotting. Xenograft mouse models were used to determine the effects of NOL6 on CRC in vivo. Tandem mass tags (TMT)-labeled quantitative proteomic technology and bioinformatic analysis were employed to identify the functional pathway and proteins regulated by NOL6. RESULTS: The Cancer Genome Atlas data analysis revealed a significant upregulation of NOL6 in CRC cells compared with adjacent normal cells. In HCT116 cells, downregulation of NOL6 was associated with decreased proliferation and colony formation, as well as increased apoptosis. Additionally, NOL6 knockdown resulted in a decrease in the weight and volume of tumors in nude mice, suggesting its role in tumorigenesis. TMT and Western blot analyses revealed that NOL6 knockdown suppressed MCM3 and MCM7 expression. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that NOL6 functions as an oncogene that facilitates CRC progression, suggesting its potential role as a therapeutic target for CRC management.",
    "WNK2 may promote ovarian cancer progression by upregulating POU5F1B.. Li F, Jia Y, Min X, Zhang P, Li Y, Li D, Cao L, Wang Y, Liang Z (2026). Ovarian cancer (OC) remains the most lethal gynecologic malignancy. Our previous work showed that WNK lysine-deficient protein kinase 2 (WNK2) promotes OC cell proliferation and migration. To clarify the molecular basis of WNK2-driven OC progression, here, we performed transcriptome sequencing to identify WNK2-regulated mRNAs and noncoding RNAs. We validated candidate targets using qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses. Functional assays, including CCK-8, colony formation, and Transwell assays, evaluated the role of POU5F1B and its capacity to rescue the effects of WNK2 knockdown. POU5F1B is a promising OC therapeutic target, mediating WNK2-driven oncogenesis in xenograft models (n = 10). Because AKT acts downstream of POU5F1B, we examined AKT phosphorylation and found that POU5F1B displayed clear oncogenic activity in OC cells. WNK2 upregulated POU5F1B mRNA and protein levels, while POU5F1B overexpression reversed the tumor-suppressive effects caused by WNK2 depletion. Mechanistically, WNK2 silencing decreased AKT phosphorylation, which POU5F1B overexpression restored. Together, these results demonstrate that WNK2 promotes OC progression by upregulating the validated oncogene POU5F1B and activating AKT signaling. These findings establish WNK2 as an oncogenic driver and a promising therapeutic target in OC.",
    "Colony Formation Assay Detecting the Proliferative Capacity of LncRNA-knockdown Osteosarcoma Cells.. Zhang X, Chang J, Yan B, Guo S, Wang X, Zhao F, Zhao P, Zhou C, Tong J, Hong Y, Yin M, Sun X, Yang Y (2026). Aberrant long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) expression profoundly influences cellular proliferation of osteosarcoma cells, suggesting that they may serve as potential therapeutic targets. However, functional studies of lncRNAs remain largely theoretical and limited to a few validations. Colony formation assays, which specifically reflect the ultimate proliferative fate of single cells, are regarded as the gold standard for evaluating long-term proliferative potential. Here, this protocol established a reliable experimental protocol using colony formation assays in lncRNA-knockdown cells to evaluate the effect of lncRNA on osteosarcoma cell proliferative capacity. This experimental protocol provides a stable, cost-effective, and efficient assay to assess the regulatory effects of lncRNA on osteosarcoma cell proliferation. This approach is not only suitable for research on osteosarcoma cells but also serves as a feasible tool for lncRNA-regulated cell proliferative capacity in other tumors. This study included a detailed detection protocol of lncRNA-knockdown and colony formation assays, with an example of the small nucleolar RNA host gene 6 (SNHG6) knockdown in osteosarcoma cells (143B). Experimental results confirmed efficient suppression of SNHG6 expression, accompanied by a marked reduction in both the number and size of colonies. These findings suggest that SNHG6 is essential for sustaining the long-term proliferative potential of osteosarcoma cells (143B).",
    "Tensor-Based Ant Colony Optimization for Set Meal Design in Online-to-Offline Restaurants.. Sun B, Yu WJ, Liu XF, Zhong J, Li JY, Zhan ZH, Kwong S, Zhang J (2026). Set meal design (SMD) for online-to-offline (O2O) restaurant services presents a complex optimization problem, requiring the simultaneous satisfaction of diverse customer preferences, operational constraints, and profit maximization objective. To address this challenge, this article proposes a comprehensive mathematical formulation for the O2O-SMD problem. This formulation integrates complex operational requirements, such as dish variety, pricing, nutritional balance, and profitability, into a unified optimization problem with well-defined objective and constraints. To efficiently solve the O2O-SMD problem, we propose a tensor-based ant colony optimization (TACO) algorithm. Distinct from traditional ant colony optimization (ACO) variants, the core of TACO lies in reformulating the fundamental ACO operations into a tensor computational structure, enabling parallel optimization over O2O-SMD tasks at the algorithmic level. Furthermore, a dedicated local search strategy is integrated to refine solutions and accelerate convergence of the algorithm. The performance of TACO is evaluated on real-world restaurant data and benchmark instances. The experimental results show that TACO significantly outperforms a wide range of comparison algorithms in terms of solution quality, scalability, and computational efficiency, confirming its effectiveness and practical value for real-world O2O-SMD problems.",
    "No apparent life-history trade-offs following selection for increased fecundity in Orius albidipennis (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae).. Shahriari Nasab F, Iranipour S, Rafat A, Michaud JP (2026). We reared the predatory bug Orius albidipennis Reuter (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae) on a diet of Ephestia kuehniella Zeller eggs and bee pollen and subjected separate lines to selection for either increased or decreased fecundity. After 18 generations, we obtained a line with 76% greater egg production compared to unselected controls, with fecundity exhibiting an estimated heritability of 0.10 ± 0.005. The line selected for low fecundity experienced rapid population decline followed by extinction after 6 generations. Compared to controls, the high-fecundity line showed no reduction in longevity or functional response to female Tetranychus urticae as prey, suggesting no inherent tradeoffs in either lifespan or foraging efficiency, which might affect biocontrol efficacy, although this may not hold true in nature where energy demands will be greater than in a laboratory setting. The high-fecundity trait remained stable for 9 generations following relaxation of selection. Although genetic admixture with wild populations, along with unknown selective forces, are likely to eventually dilute trait expression in the field, the high reproductive rate obtained via artificial selection could serve to reduce production costs substantially and improve levels of pest control for several generations post-release in augmentation applications.",
    "Pharmacological Depletion of Retinal Mononuclear Phagocytes Is Neuroprotective in a Mouse Model of Mitochondrial Optic Neuropathy.. Okrent Smolar AL, Viswanath R, Bomze HM, Hao Y, Stinnett SS, Gospe SM 3rd (2026). PURPOSE: The Vglut2-Cre;ndufs4loxP/loxP mouse strain with retinal ganglion cell (RGC)-specific mitochondrial complex I dysfunction develops severe RGC degeneration by postnatal day 90 (P90), with accompanying retinal mononuclear phagocyte (MNP) accumulation. We have reported that continuous exposure to hypoxia partially rescues RGC death in these mice, with minimal effect on MNP abundance. We hypothesized that pharmacological depletion of MNPs with the colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor inhibitor pexidartinib would enhance RGC neuroprotection by hypoxia. METHODS: Iba1+ retinal MNP depletion was assessed in C57Bl/6J mice fed control or pexidartinib-infused chow beginning at P25. Subsequently, Vglut2-Cre;ndufs4loxP/loxP mice and control littermates were raised under normoxia or hypoxia and fed control or pexidartinib chow from P25 to P90. The neuroprotective effect of pexidartinib and hypoxia alone and in combination was assessed by quantifying RGC soma and axon survival in retinal flat mounts and optic nerve cross-sections. RESULTS: Pexidartinib completely depleted retinal MNPs within 1 week of treatment. Untreated Vglut2-Cre;ndufs4loxP/loxP mice exhibited the expected approximately 50% reduction of RGC soma and axon survival at P90 (P < 0.0001 for both). Hypoxia or pexidartinib monotherapy each reduced RGC degeneration by more than one-half, whereas their combination resulted in complete RGC neuroprotection (P < 0.01 for all 3 treatments). Normal myelination patterns were restored in mice receiving dual therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Pexidartinib effectively depletes retinal MNPs and is neuroprotective in the setting of severe RGC mitochondrial dysfunction. This therapeutic effect is additive to that of hypoxia. Combating retinal neuro-inflammation may therefore be a useful adjunct therapy in mitochondrial optic neuropathies like Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON).",
    "CXCL8/SDC1 axis mediates tumor stem cell interactions to drive remote transfer in thyroid cancer.. Wang W, Zhou J, Tao B, Kong N, Shao J (2026). This study explores the molecular mechanisms behind the remote transfer of thyroid cancer (THCA) by investigating the interaction network of C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 8+ (CXCL8+ monocytes and syndecan-1+ (SDC1+) tumor stem cells using single-cell and spatial transcriptome sequencing. Tumor samples from THCA patients were analyzed using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), spatial transcriptome sequencing, and tumor tissue transcriptome analysis. Data were processed with Seurat and CellChat R packages, integrated via the SPOTlight package, and correlated with clinical data from the UCSC Xena database. Functional pathway enrichment analyses were performed using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), Gene Ontology (GO), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome (KEGG). In vitro, a co-culture system of monocytes and THCA stem cells was developed, and protein levels were measured via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blotting. The self-renewal and migration of follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) 238-S cells were assessed through sphere formation, colony formation, Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), and Transwell assays. In vivo, a subcutaneous tumor xenograft model and a lung metastasis model were established in nude mice. Transcriptomic analyses identified the CXCL8/SDC1 axis as a key mediator of Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) signaling activation, promoting THCA stem cell self-renewal, invasion, and metastasis. CXCL8/SDC1 expression was significantly higher in the high-risk C1 subtype of THCA patients and correlated with a worse prognosis. In vitro and animal studies confirmed that the CXCL8/SDC1 axis drives tumor progression and metastasis. The interaction between CXCL8+ monocytes and SDC1+ tumor stem cells activates the JAK-STAT pathway, facilitating the remote transfer of THCA. Targeting the CXCL8/SDC1 axis may provide novel therapeutic strategies for improving THCA patient outcomes.",
    "Selective deletion of the membrane-bound isoform of CSF1 in vivo augments the anabolic response to PTH without impairing bone resorption.. Yao GQ, Zhu M, Insogna K (2026). Single daily doses of parathyroid hormone (PTH) are an established anabolic therapy for osteoporosis. The actions of PTH in bone are modulated by interactions between osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) exists in both soluble (sCSF1) and membrane-bound (mCSF1) isoforms, with distinct roles in skeletal remodeling identified for each isoform. To investigate the specific role of mCSF1 in PTH-induced bone anabolism, we treated mCSF1 knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice with single daily doses of hPTH (1-34) for 4 weeks. Both genotypes exhibited increased bone mineral density and trabecular bone volume in response to PTH, but KO mice demonstrated significantly greater bone density gains. Histomorphometric analysis demonstrated enhanced osteoblast activity in KO mice, with no significant differences in osteoclast numbers or in the bone resorption marker carboxyterminal cross-linked telopeptide of type 1 collagen (serum CTx), compared to WT. These findings indicate that mCSF1 constrains the anabolic effects of PTH, likely by modulating osteoblast activity, and that its absence enhances bone formation without disrupting resorptive processes. Targeting mCSF1 may therefore represent a strategy to amplify the skeletal benefits of anabolic therapies without impairing bone turnover.",
    "Beyond the patch: leveraging functional habitat delineation in fragmentation-biodiversity research.. Dennis M, Huck J, Holt C, McHenry E, Andersson E, Sharma S, Haase D (2026). CONTEXT: Theoretical and methodological developments in the field of fragmentation-biodiversity research continue to rely on the central concept of the habitat patch where patch size and number are considered particularly relevant to spatially structured ecological communities. However, although great interest has been shown in the effects of habitat fragmentation, appropriate methods for the spatial delineation of habitat have not received equal attention. In this paper, we argue that existing methods are not consistent with a functional definition of habitat as they fail to address key methodological challenges. These relate to the need to acknowledge a) the contribution of multiple resource types to habitat, b) the influence of neighbouring land cover types and c) the continuity-contiguity problem (the tendency of habitat to exhibit properties of gradation and aggregation). OBJECTIVES: In this second of two papers on this topic, we present an application of a new methodological framework outlined by Dennis et al. (this issue) that offers a route to a more functional definition and delineation of habitat through the use of spatial kernels and the generation of Type 1 and 2 fuzzy sets from landscape classification algorithms. We present a demonstration of the framework applied to a real-world landscape, in which we illustrate the impact of adopting alternative perspectives with respect to habitat delineation on the ecological process of habitat connectivity. METHODS: We demonstrate the functional delineation of habitat for a focal generic woodland species (FGWS) in a real-world landscape classified through the application of a fuzzy Random Forest classifier. We employ nesting, foraging and dispersal parameters relevant to the FGWS to achieve a functional estimate of habitat. We test the influence of habitat fragmentation (number of patches controlling for total habitat amount) on potential functional connectivity for the FGWS based on contiguous (emphasising aggregation and homogeneity), continuous (emphasizing gradation) and functional (integrating multiple resource types and neighbourhood effects) habitat perspectives. RESULTS: Our results indicate large discrepancies between the three perspectives on habitat delineation across key fragmentation-relevant metrics (total area, number of patches and potential functional connectivity). Importantly, a functional habitat perspective supports markedly different conclusions (compared to contiguous and continuous perspectives) with respect to the relationship between fragmentation (number of patches) and connectivity, and estimates of the contribution of individual habitat patches to landscape-scale connectivity. CONCLUSION: The functional habitat perspective, operationalized by harnessing uncertainty in landscape classification and employing spatial kernels to parameterise neighbourhood effects based on species-specific parameters, achieves a functional delineation of habitat. Our study suggests that such a view has major implications for our understanding of habitat fragmentation because it requires that the latter also be assigned a functional definition. The framework centred on functional habitat delineation is generalizable to a wide range of landscape contexts and advances current methods in spatial ecology. This opens up opportunities for inquiry and the development of new theoretical positions within the fragmentation-biodiversity debate.

    "Case Report: Pathologic complete response to PRaG therapy in an elderly patient with refractory metastatic gastric cancer.. Lv J, Yu F, Pan L, Fang Y, Zhong Z, Bai X, Gao J, Wei Z (2025). Hepatoid adenocarcinoma of the stomach (HAS) is a rare histologic subtype of gastric cancer with distinct pathological features and poor prognosis. Surgery and chemotherapy remain the primary treatment modalities, but outcomes are generally unsatisfactory. Radiotherapy can enhance tumor immunogenicity by releasing tumor antigens, thereby promoting antitumor immune responses and potentiating the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. We report a case of advanced HAS that progressed after first-line treatment with chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapy. The patient subsequently received a combination of radiotherapy, programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blockade, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-termed PRaG therapy. The tumor demonstrated significant shrinkage following PRaG treatment and ultimately achieved pathologic complete response (pCR), with no serious adverse events aside from mild abdominal pain (NRS score 2). This case suggests that PRaG therapy may represent a promising therapeutic approach for patients with metastatic HAS.",
    "The power of the group: How neuroscience supports expanding the therapeutic dyad through group psychotherapy.. Duquette P (2025). Group psychotherapy represents a therapeutic modality that provides unique affordances for patients, allowing layers of engagement by the patient in the psychotherapeutic process that are not available in dyadic psychotherapeutic treatment. This article considers psychodynamic group psychotherapy through the lens of current neuroscientific concepts. In doing so, we offer a framework for clinicians to consider how beliefs and habits that are originally adaptive become maladaptive and persist, and why patients hold on to maladaptive beliefs about the world and their own agency that are not reflective of the present-day moment. Neuroscientific proposals describing how early-life adaptations may result in longstanding false inferences regarding cause and effect in the world and within their emotional experiences will be evaluated alongside related psychological concepts. We will present and define the importance of neuroscientific concepts to the practicing psychotherapist, such as predictive processing, active inference, and the mentalization of interoception, as applicable to psychological and behavioral processes evidenced by the patient. The value that group psychotherapy specifically adds to processes needed to generate meaningful change will be explored in depth. How the milieu of group psychotherapy presents epistemic affordances to the patients in the group, which can then be leveraged in multiple ways to increase therapeutic benefit, will be addressed. Affordances in the group that offer patients unique interpersonal opportunities to address intrapersonal experiences such as mentalization of interoception and the activation of inference processes, creating lasting change, will be examined. The means by which interactions among group members decrease epistemic vigilance, increase epistemic trust, and facilitate epistemic foraging, thereby supporting necessary changes in mentalization capacity for patients, will be described. A case example will bring to light the elements, both neuroscientifically based and psychologically based, that are presented regarding the power of the group. Through access to and engagement with the process opportunities the group presents, patients can be supported by both therapists and other group members, affecting meaningful changes and ongoing present-moment adaptations over time for the individuals.",
    "Multi-omics integration and machine learning identify NPC2 as a prognostic and treatment-responsive regulator in lung adenocarcinoma.. Li A, Cui P, Liu L, Liu J, Zhou X, Wu W, Yan Z, Guan Y, Zhang H (2025). BACKGROUND: This study aims to define a novel molecular subtype of LUAD by integrating multiple omics data. Additionally, we develop and validate an Artificial Intelligence Derived Prognostic Index (AIDPI) that predicts the prognosis of LUAD patients, identifies potential therapeutic targets. METHODS: This study employed ten clustering algorithms from the R package \"MOVICS\" to integrate multi-omics data of LUAD sourced from TCGA database for molecular typing. Subsequently, an Artificial Intelligence Derived Prognostic Index (AIDPI) was constructed as the most effective indicator for predicting the overall survival rate of LUAD patients. The biological functions and mechanisms of NPC2 in lung adenocarcinoma were elucidated through both in vitro and in vivo experiments, which included CCK-8 assays, colony formation assays, flow cytometry, Transwell assays, and xenograft tumor models. Additionally, the impact of NPC2 on Ribociclib sensitivity was investigated through drug correlation analysis and molecular docking, while the predictive value of NPC2 regarding immunotherapy benefits was validated using the immune cell infiltration analysis. RESULTS: Through multi-omics clustering, we identified two subtypes of lung adenocarcinoma associated with prognosis, with the CS1 subtype exhibiting the most favorable prognostic outcomes. The low AIDPI group exhibited a more positive prognosis, accompanied by increased immune cell infiltration and activation of immune pathways. Meanwhile, NPC2 was recognized as a standalone risk factor for LUAD, with its high expression significantly improving the overall survival of LUAD patients. Functionally, the overexpression of NPC2 promotes tumorigenesis in LUAD both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, the upregulation of NPC2 expression inhibits the progression of LUAD by suppressing the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Our study also demonstrated that high NPC2 expression is positively correlated with Ribociclib sensitivity, as confirmed by in vitro experiments. Furthermore, NPC2 expression is positively correlated with ImmuneScore, and may serve as a predictive indicator for the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy. CONCLUSION: The comprehensive analysis of multiple omics data significantly enhances the molecular classification of lung adenocarcinoma. Furthermore, AIDPI is a potential biomarker that predicts the prognosis of LUAD patients. NPC2 inhibits the progression of LUAD by suppressing the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and enhancing the chemotherapy sensitivity to Ribociclib.",
    "PTEN enhances the radiosensitivity of melanoma by inhibiting DNA-PKcs.. Zhu S, Xu H, Shen F, Chen F, Wang Y (2025). BACKGROUND: The phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a classical tumor-suppressor gene. Its expression deficiency concurrently drives disease progression in approximately 30% of melanomas and is closely associated with radiotherapy tolerance. However, there is a lack of systematic evidence regarding whether and how PTEN regulates the radiosensitivity of melanoma. METHODS: The expression of PTEN was validated using TCGA database, clinical tissue microarrays, and multiple melanoma cell lines. PTEN knockdown (PTEN-KD) and PTEN overexpression (PTEN-OE) stable cell lines were constructed using lentiviral vectors. CCK-8, colony formation assay, annexin V/PI flow cytometry, neutral comet assay, cell-cycle analysis, and Western blotting were used to assess the biological changes in cells after 0 Gy-8 Gy γ-ray irradiation (IR). A cell-derived xenograft model was established, and the tumor volume was observed after local 10 Gy IR for 28 days; in addition, H&E, Ki67, and TUNEL evaluations were performed. RESULTS: The expression of PTEN in melanoma tissues and cell lines was significantly lower than that in normal controls. IR could induce a transient upregulation of PTEN followed by rapid downregulation. PTEN-OE significantly inhibited proliferation, reduced the clone survival rate, increased apoptosis, and weakened radiation-induced G2/M phase arrest; however, the opposite was true for PTEN-KD. Mechanistically, PTEN-OE inhibited the DNA-PKcs axis, reduced NHEJ-mediated rapid repair, and increased the persistent expression of γ-H2AX. PTEN-KD activated the p-ATM/p-Chk2 signaling. Animal experiments confirmed that the tumor volume in the PTEN-OE + IR group was significantly lower than that in the NC + IR group, with an expanded necrotic area, a decreased Ki67 index, and an increased TUNEL-positive rate. CONCLUSION: PTEN enhances the radiosensitivity of melanoma by inhibiting the DNA-PKcs signal, weakening NHEJ repair, and delaying cell-cycle recovery. PTEN can serve as a biomarker for radiotherapy response prediction and a target for sensitization intervention, providing an experimental basis for precise radiotherapy strategies for melanoma.",
    "Sensitivity and resistance pattern of uropathogens causing urinary tract infections among adults at a teaching hospital in South India - A retrospective analysis.. Chandrakumar S, Manickam S, Nishanthi A, Thiyagarajan M, Nitya S (2025). OBJECTIVES: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are highly prevalent and can lead to severe complications if untreated. While prompt empirical therapy is crucial, initiating treatment without antibiotic susceptibility testing can exacerbate antimicrobial resistance. This study aims to identify the antibiotic sensitivity and resistance pattern of uropathogens causing urinary tract infections in adults at a teaching hospital in South India over five years (2019-2023). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cross-sectional study analyzed all urine culture reports that were positive for a single species of organisms with a significant colony count from both hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients (aged ≥ 18 yrs) who visited our hospital from January 2019 to December 2023. Data were extracted from the culture reports that were maintained electronically in the Department of Microbiology. RESULTS: Of the total of 46,453 urine culture sensitivity reports available during the study period, 13,124 were culture positive. The majority of the positive urine culture reports belonged to females (62.4%) and the predominant age group affected was >60 years (37.2%). The commonest organisms encountered during these study periods were E. coli (44.6% to 50.5%) followed by Enterococcus (7.8% to 12.4%)/ Klebsiella (9% to 10.5%). Uropathogens exhibited >80% resistance to antibiotics such as ampicillin, cefazolin, ciprofloxacin, penicillin, ceftazidime/clavulanic acid, and cefotaxime in at least one of the study years. CONCLUSION: Our study shows a concerning trend of increasing resistance among uropathogens to commonly used antibiotics, warranting an urgent need for urine culture-based antibiotic prescribing practices.",
    "State-level Gender Inequality and Couples' Relative Earnings Following Parenthood over Four Decades.. Musick K, Jeong W (2026). We draw from gender perspectives on the division of labor and emerging research on structural sexism to empirically evaluate how systemic gender inequality shapes within-couple earnings inequality at the turning point of parenthood. Our data on pre- and post-birth earnings come from successive couple-level panels of the Current Population Survey over four decades (1982-2020, N = 87,694 couples and 175,388 couple-observations), merged to state-level indicators of gender inequality spanning the same time period that tap the devaluation of work done by women across multiple domains. Results from fixed effect models suggest that state-level gender inequality shapes couples' responses to parenthood in meaningful ways, with steeper declines in wives' relative earnings among new parents living in states that place lower value on women's work. The estimated effect of sexism is gendered, operating through wives' earnings. It persists through the early childbearing years and across decades, and it varies little by measures of couples' social advantage. Evidence that structural sexism exacerbates earnings inequality among parents is robust, with implications for mothers' economic vulnerability and well-being.",
    "Comparison of nutritional outcomes and complication profiles of commercial enteral nutrition and homemade homogenate in patients with dysphagia who are chronically immobilized.. Liu X, Tan L, Liang Y, Wang X, Liu Y, Pang T, Zhao N (2025). OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the nutritional outcomes and complications associated with homemade homogenate administered via nasogastric tube vs. a commercially available enteral nutrition formula in patients with dysphagia who are chronically immobilized. METHODS: In a prospective randomized controlled trial, 135 patients were allocated to receive either homemade homogenate (n = 67) or commercial enteral nutrition (n = 68). All patients received equivalent pharmacological and rehabilitative interventions. Nutritional indicators, including albumin, prealbumin, hemoglobin, body mass index, mid-arm circumference, calf circumference, arm muscle circumference, triceps skinfold thickness, and Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 (NRS2002), were assessed on days 1, 30, and 45 following admission. The incidence of complications, including pulmonary infections, gastrointestinal adverse reactions, and pressure ulcers, was recorded. Microbial colony counts were assessed in samples of homemade homogenate. Data were analyzed using independent-sample t tests and chi-squared tests. RESULTS: By day 45, patients in the commercial formula group exhibited significantly greater improvement in serum and anthropometric nutritional indices compared to those in the homemade homogenate group. NRS2002 scores decreased more substantially in the commercial formula group at days 30 and 45. This group also experienced a lower incidence of pulmonary infections, gastrointestinal symptoms, and pressure ulcers. Among 15 samples of homemade homogenate, 4 exceeded the acceptable microbial colony count. Additionally, the homemade formula was lower in macro- and micronutrients and higher in sodium compared to the commercial preparation. CONCLUSION: Commercial enteral nutrient solution demonstrated superior efficacy in improving nutritional status and reducing complications in patients with dysphagia and prolonged immobility. Although homemade homogenate may be considered in resource-constrained settings, it requires careful formulation, enhanced hygienic preparation, and standardized storage protocols to ensure safety and nutritional adequacy.",
    "Case Report of Plastic String Entanglement Mortality in a Breeding Oriental Reed Warbler.. Zhang H, Liu Y, Wang Y, Fu G, Ma L, Dong J (2026). Rapid economic development and urbanization have exerted considerable impacts on the environment and wildlife. Species that survive and establish populations in new environments benefit from abundant food resources and reduced predation pressure; however, they are also exposed to certain risks. Plastic production and use have increased markedly alongside population growth and urbanization, with large quantities of plastic products entering ecological environments. Whereas birds and other animals use them as nesting materials, plastic nesting materials pose toxicity and entanglement risks, affecting bird survival and reproduction. In addition, although numerous studies have reported cases of avian mortality due to entanglement, such studies have predominantly focused on medium to large species (mostly seabirds) and nestlings. This study documents a case observed on June 28, 2025, in the Baiyangdian Wetland, Hebei Province, China, where an adult breeding Oriental Reed Warbler parent bird died due to entanglement in plastic string present in its nesting material. The nest contained one unhatched egg, and another parent bird was observed maintaining vigilance near the nest. No subsequent egg-laying was observed, suggesting that the deceased parent was likely female and that the breeding attempt failed. Subsequently, the nest status was photographed and documented. Based on local conditions, the plastic string probably originated from fishing equipment or reed-weaving. This case directly demonstrates the hazards that plastic products pose to avian survival and reproduction.",
    "Phenotypic variation in growth and biofilm formation of Leuconostoc spp. from sugar beet factories.. Joshi S, Bruni GO, Zimmerman T, Terrell E, Salter J, Kashem MNH, Nam S (2025). Leuconostoc bacteria are common colonizers of sugar crop processing environments, resulting in sucrose losses and the formation of exopolysaccharides (EPS) and biofilms that can lead to reduced product quality and higher operational costs. Although Leuconostoc species are present in abundance, strain-specific differences in biofilm formation, EPS production, and matrix structure are not well understood. In this study, nine sugar beet factory-derived Leuconostoc isolates were grown and evaluated using a combination of batch adherence and continuous flow biofilm bioreactor assays, cryo scanning electron microscopy (SEM), EPS quantification, viscosity testing, and growth rate analysis to determine which phenotypes correlate with biofilm formation. The results from the adherence batch-phase biofilms indicated significant phenotypic variation among isolates, with the highest bacterial proliferation by L. suionicum BSDF25-7 and BSDF48-3, exceeding 5 × 108 colony-forming units/cm2 on stainless steel coupons. In contrast, the highest biofilm biomass accumulated was BSDF2-3 and BSDF25-7, indicating differences in cell proliferation and biofilm matrix structure. CryoSEM imaging revealed diverse biofilm structures, such as silo-like aggregates and patchy surface colonization, indicating strain-specific extracellular matrix assembly strategies. Flow-through biofilm bioreactor assays further identified BSDF2-3 and BSDF5-1 as predominant biofilm formers with the highest CFU/cm2 present at 4 × 108 and 1 × 109, respectively, while BSDF2-3 accumulated twice the biofilm biomass as BSDF5-1. Leuconostoc strains BSDF25-7 and BSDF48-3 produced high levels of dextran and EPS, while BSDF2-3 consistently formed dense, shear-resistant biofilms despite slow growth and low EPS levels, suggesting the possibility of alternative matrix composition or structural adaptations. Individual Leuconostoc strains adapt uniquely, adding to the functional diversity of biofilms that impact formation, matrix complexity, and resistance to environmental stressors. This study furthers our understanding of EPS and growth phenotypes involved in biofilm formation while providing a working model, enabling the development of future antimicrobial mitigation strategies.",
    "Polygonum barbatum extract induces ER stress-mediated UPR and autophagy to suppress colorectal cancer growth.. Chang PK, Yen IC, Tsai WC, Lin KT, Lee SY (2026). Polygonum barbatum extract (PBE) is a traditional herbal remedy historically used for its analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and diuretic effects. However, its anticancer potential and underlying molecular mechanisms in colorectal cancer (CRC) remain largely unexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that PBE exerts potent cytotoxicity in CRC cells by inducing both the unfolded protein response (UPR) and autophagy. In vitro, PBE treatment resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of cell viability and colony formation in multiple CRC cell lines. Moreover, in a HCT116 xenograft mouse model, oral administration of PBE significantly inhibited tumor growth without inducing overt toxicity. Mechanistically, PBE increased the accumulation of acidic vesicular organelles and upregulated key UPR regulators-including BiP, IRE1, and PERK-accompanied by enhanced conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II and reduced p62 levels, indicative of elevated autophagic flux. Notably, co-treatment with chloroquine, an autophagy inhibitor, partially rescued cell viability, underscoring that autophagy contributes to PBE-induced cell death. In addition, PBE modulated several critical signaling pathways by inhibiting EGFR, mTOR, and STAT3 while concurrently activating downstream ERK and the AMPK-ACC axis. Collectively, these results reveal that PBE triggers ER stress-mediated UPR and autophagy to promote autophagic cell death in CRC, supporting its potential development as a novel therapeutic agent for colorectal cancer.",
    "Kidney Transplantation-Induced Reduction in Myocardial Fibrosis and Modulation of Plasma Proteome: Results of a Pilot Study.. Dobre MA, Liu C, Janus SE, Zhang L, Padiyar A, Ahlawat S, Gaivin RJ, Iyengar SK, Rahman M, Yahr J, Rajagopalan S, Al-Kindi S, Huml AM, Schelling JR (2026). RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: Kidney transplantation (KT) improves cardiovascular outcomes in patients with kidney failure, yet the biological mechanisms underlying post-KT myocardial recovery remain unclear. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective observational cohort study with matched controls. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Fifty participants were enrolled at 2 transplant centers: 28 received a living KT, and a cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) scan assessment of interstitial myocardial fibrosis with T1 maps before and nine months post-KT; 22 matched waitlisted controls had baseline and 9-month CMRI scans. The groups were matched using baseline characteristics and T1 values. EXPOSURE: Receipt of kidney transplantation. OUTCOME: Change in native T1 mapping CMRI scan, a surrogate marker of interstitial myocardial fibrosis. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Regression models were used to estimate the effect of KT versus no KT (the waitlisted control group) on interstitial myocardial fibrosis, adjusted for demographic characteristics, comorbidities, blood pressure, and medications. Plasma collected at baseline was analyzed using SomaScan v.4.1 (6,472 unique proteins). Regression models were used to identify proteins associated with baseline and longitudinal changes in T1, adjusted for clinical covariates and corrected for multiple testing. RESULTS: KT recipients had reduced interstitial myocardial fibrosis compared with waitlisted controls (-47.49 ± 81.63 vs +13.77 ± 62.13 ms, P = 0.01). Forty-three plasma proteins were significantly associated with baseline T1 values; macrophage colony-stimulating factor displayed the greatest retest reproducibility (80%) and positive association with T1 (P = 3.1 × 10-4). Pathway enrichment analyses identified 17 interconnected fibrosis-related proteins with biological relevance to cardiac remodeling. LIMITATIONS: A modest sample size and a single time-point proteomic assessment. External validation is needed. CONCLUSIONS: KT leads to regression of interstitial myocardial fibrosis within 9 months, supporting a structural cardiac benefit of transplantation. Pretransplant proteomic signatures, particularly macrophage colony-stimulating factor, reflect underlying fibrotic burden and may serve as a predictive biomarker to monitor post-KT cardiac recovery. Kidney transplantation results in improved cardiovascular health, but how the 2 are connected is not fully understood. In this study, we followed people with kidney failure who received a kidney transplant and compared them to similar patients who remained on the waitlist. We examined heart imaging to measure changes in diffuse fibrosis (scarring) over 9 months and association with circulating blood proteins. We found that transplants were linked to reduced heart fibrosis, and 1 protein in particular—macrophage colony-stimulating factor—correlated with reduced fibrosis. These findings suggest that kidney transplants may help improve heart tissue structure, and identifying key proteins, such as macrophage colony-stimulating factor, could represent a tool to monitor heart recovery in the future.",
    "Manipulating vector transmission reveals local processes in Bartonella communities of bats.. McKee CD, Webb CT, Kosoy MY, Suu-Ire R, Ntiamoa-Baidu Y, Cunningham AA, Wood JLN, Hayman DTS (2026). Infectious diseases result from multiple interactions among microbes and hosts, but community ecology approaches are rarely applied. Manipulation of vector populations provides a unique opportunity to test the importance of vectors in infection cycles while also observing changes in pathogen community diversity and species interactions. Yet for many vector-borne infections in wildlife, a biological vector has not been experimentally verified, and few manipulative studies have been performed. Using a captive colony of fruit bats in Ghana, we conducted the first study to experimentally test the role of bat flies as vectors of Bartonella species. We observed changes in the Bartonella bacteria community over time following the decline of bat flies and again after their subsequent restocking. Reduced transmission rates led to microbial community changes attributed to ecological drift and potential species sorting through interspecific competition mediated by host immunity. We demonstrate that forces maintaining diversity in communities of free-living macroorganisms act in similar ways in communities of symbiotic microorganisms, both within and among hosts.",
    "Targeted E3 Region Engineering Boosts Antitumor Efficacy of Conditionally Replicating Adenoviruses in an Immunocompetent Tumor Model.. Si Y, Jin X, Xiong S, Xiao D, Sun X, Huang X, Ji T, Ma D, Ding Y, Han Y, Li F (2026). The adenovirus E3 region's immune-modulating genes (gp19K, Adenovirus Death Protein [ADP], E3B) are frequently modified in oncolytic adenoviruses (OAds) through deletion and transgene insertion like granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). However, the synergistic effects of dual-gene deletions on antitumor efficacy and transgene capacity remain unexplored. To address this, we constructed three E3-modified OAds including OAd5-delgp19K (delgp19K), M20 (delgp19K and ADP), M22-0 (delgp19K and E3B), and their GM-CSF-armed derivatives, systematically evaluating the impact of ADP and E3B deletions on viral replication, tumor cell lysis, immune modulation, and in vivo antitumor activity. Key findings revealed that gp19K/ADP deletion OAd prolonged intracellular viral replication, creating a \"viral bomb\" effect that delayed cell lysis, evading anti-adenovirus antibodies, sustained GM-CSF expression, and culminating in superior tumor suppression. Gp19K/E3B deletion OAd accelerated viral dissemination but triggered rapid antibody-mediated clearance in immunocompetent hosts, resulting in transient GM-CSF expression and diminished therapeutic persistence. In immunocompetent Syrian hamster Hap-T1 subcutaneous tumor models, gp19K/ADP deletion OAd demonstrated potent tumor inhibition, durable immune microenvironment remodeling, robust viral replication, and evading anti-adenovirus antibodies. These results underscore the critical role of coordinated gp19K/ADP deletion in optimizing viral replication, transgene expression, and immune evasion, providing a strategic framework for engineering next-generation OAds.",
    "Selective small molecule targeting of KDM4 as a therapeutic strategy to reduce proliferation of acute myeloid leukaemia.. Monaghan L, Bunschoten RP, Bittencourt-Silvestre J, Park T, Gannon S, Pirvan PA, Hoose A, Wheadon H, Liskamp RMJ, Huang X, Jørgensen HG (2026). Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is an aggressive disease with poor survival and high relapse rates. Coupled with the complex mutational burden observed, there is an unmet clinical need for more targeted therapies. Epigenetic therapies have shown promise both as monotherapy and in combination strategies and specifically histone lysine demethylase, KDM4A (Lysine demethylase 4), plays a role in the maintenance of AML, with its short hairpin (shRNA) knockdown sufficient to target leukaemia cells while sparing normal haemopoietic cells. In this study, we utilised a novel KDM4 inhibitor based on the structure of IOX-1, the most characterised inhibitor of the 2-oxygenase enzymes to which the KDM4 family belong, to investigate further the role of KDM4A in AML. Our compound induced AML cell death with cell cycle arrest, failure of colony formation and transcriptomic changes in metabolism, transcription control and response to stress. With known roles for KDM4A family members in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage response repair pathways, inhibition of KDM4A increased accrual of double strand DNA breaks. Hence, we demonstrated KDM4i sensitisation of leukaemia cells to inhibitors of DNA damage pathways such as poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, olaparib, suggesting future clinical evaluation of KDM4A and other key components in DNA damage/response signalling pathways as potential therapeutic vulnerabilities in AML.",
    "Avian neighbours: density patterns of synanthropic birds along a rural-urban landscape gradient in Northern India.. Gautam A, Singh A, Kalle R (2026). Unbiased and accurate estimation of bird density are prerequisites to monitor the impact of urbanization on avian communities. Synanthropic birds are reliable indicators of landscape modification in small tropical cities with rural-urban ecological settings. We conducted 183 fixed-width point counts to record avian communities along the rural-urban gradient in Mirzapur and Bhadohi. We applied hierarchical distance-sampling to estimate the summer density of 35 bird species across eight foraging guilds in response to vegetation, land cover, human activity and housing type, accounting for detection probability as a function of weather. Twenty-seven species (77%) showed differences in density across the landscape gradient. The density of frugivores was highest in urban gradient, a carnivore was highest in rural, and a scavenger was highest in the semi-urban gradient thereby supporting the resource concentration hypothesis. Insectivores, granivores and omnivores showed variable density patterns along the gradient. The relatively lower density of synanthropic birds in semi-urban and urban fringes indicates the need for enhanced green space and vegetation structure along intermediate landscape gradient. The habitat associations and population sizes of synanthropic birds are useful for landscape managers and local stakeholders to maximize avifaunal diversity in the intermediate landscapes of the rural-urban continuum in Uttar Pradesh.",
    "Extracorporeal cardiac shock wave stimulation enhances the therapeutic efficacy of intravenously delivered endothelial colony-forming cells via PI3K/AKT signaling in a rat myocardial infarction model.. Wang M, Yang D, Ma Y, Shi Y, Lun J, Zhang C, Li X, Shi Y, Cai H (2026). BACKGROUND: Extracorporeal cardiac shock wave (ECSW) therapy enhances the function of endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs), but whether it can serve as a preconditioning strategy to enhance myocardial infarction (MI) therapy remains unclear. This study investigated the efficacy and mechanism of intravenously delivered ECSW-preconditioned ECFCs (SW-ECFCs) in a rat MI model. METHODS: ECFCs were isolated from the bone marrow of ApoE-/- rats and fully characterized. RNA sequencing of control ECFCs versus SW-ECFCs revealed significant enrichment of the PI3K/AKT pathway. We therefore performed a series of in vitro functional assays on these cells, including Transwell migration, Matrigel tube formation, CCK-8 proliferation, flow cytometric apoptosis analysis, and VEGF-A ELISA. . The role of the PI3K/AKT pathway was interrogated using the inhibitor LY294002. Subsequently, an acute MI model was established in ApoE-/- rats via left anterior descending coronary artery ligation. Rats were randomized into four groups: MI + PBS, MI + ECFCs, MI + SW-ECFCs, and MI + LY294002-pretreated SW-ECFCs (LY-SW-ECFCs), with sham-operated rats as controls. Comprehensive evaluations included echocardiography, serum injury biomarkers, TTC, and histopathological (H&E, Masson) staining, immunohistochemical detection of cardiomyocyte apoptosis and p-eNOS, immunofluorescence assessment of ECFC homing and vascular markers (CD31, α-SMA, VEGF-A), tissue/plasma nitric oxide measurement, and Western blot analysis of PI3K/AKT signaling proteins. RESULTS: Transcriptomic analysis revealed significant enrichment of the PI3K/AKT pathway in SW-ECFCs. Functionally, ECSW enhanced ECFCs migration, tube formation, proliferation, and VEGF-A secretion, while reducing apoptosis; these effects were largely abolished by PI3K inhibition. In vivo, serum levels of CK, CK-MB, and LDH were significantly elevated in all MI groups compared to the Sham group (P < 0.01), indicating comparable initial injury. However, no significant differences were observed among treatment groups (P > 0.05). SW-ECFCs transplantation significantly improved cardiac function, reduced infarct size, fibrosis, and apoptosis, and enhanced angiogenesis (P < 0.05). These benefits were associated with increased levels of p-AKT, p-eNOS, and BCL-2 protein as well as nitric oxide content, while suppressing the expression of cleaved caspase-3 (P < 0.05). Crucially, all these therapeutic benefits were largely abolished by PI3K inhibition. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this study demonstrates that preconditioning ECFCs with ECSW significantly enhances their therapeutic efficacy for myocardial infarction, improving both cardiac function and structural repair. These benefits are mediated primarily through activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which augments cell homing, paracrine activity, and survival, thereby providing a novel and promising strategy for cardiac regeneration.",
    "Effects of cardiopulmonary bypass on in vitro proliferation of human pancreatic cancer cells and plasma growth factor levels.. Katagiri S, Itaya T, Sano M, Kiuchi N, Toyoshima Y, Takagi S, Suzuki T (2026). BACKGROUND: Advances in medicine lead to an increase in the number of patients with concurrent heart disease and cancer. We investigated the effect of cardiac surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) on the blood levels of growth factor cytokines, and assessed whether it might affect the proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells. METHODS: Ten consenting patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery with the use of CPB under general anesthesia. We obtained patients' serum at each of the following time points: between median sternotomy and before activating CPB (pre-CPB), and after activating CPB (post-CPB). Growth factor cytokines in plasma samples were analyzed using cytokine array. Proliferation assay was performed using pancreatic cancer cells (PANC-1 and PK-1) incubated in culture medium containing patients' serum at a concentration of 30%. The levels of cytokines and proliferation of cancer cells were compared between pre-CPB and post-CPB samples. RESULTS: Plasma and serum from eight patients were analyzed. PANC-1 and PK-1 cells proliferated significantly more following incubation with post-CPB (125%, P = 0.014 and 120%, P = 0.030, respectively) than pre-CPB samples. The following cytokines were significantly increased post-CPB compared to pre-CPB: amphiregulin (42 fold), basic fibroblast growth factor (5 fold), heparin binding-epidermal growth factor (9199 fold), hepatocyte growth factor (9 fold), insulin-like growth factor-binding protein (IGFBP)-1 (11 fold), IGFBP-4 (15 fold), insulin-like growth factor-2 (2 fold), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (2 fold), neurotrophin-4 (10 fold), transforming growth factor beta-3 (2 fold), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A (3 fold), and VEGF receptor 2 (3 fold). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that cardiac surgery with CPB increases the plasma levels of several growth factors, thus potentially promoting pancreatic cancer cell proliferation, as seen in the in vitro study using serum from non-cancer patients.

    "Dampened Reactive Hematopoiesis and Systemic Inflammatory Response Following Early Recurrent Myocardial Infarction in Mice.. Zhang Y, He H, Li X, Cui C (2026). Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) impacts the regenerative capacity of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) following injury, but it remains unclear if these functional alterations persist beyond the initial ischemic event.A minimally invasive mouse model of recurrent myocardial infarction was established using echocardiography-guided coronary interventions. Bone marrow HSPCs were quantified and analyzed for proliferation by flow cytometry and BrdU incorporation. Peripheral blood leukocytes and inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, G-CSF) were measured by flow cytometry and ELISA. Bone marrow extracellular TGF-β1 was assessed by ELISA, and its functional role was evaluated through antibody-mediated inhibition.The minimally invasive infarction model was validated through electrocardiography, cardiac biomarkers, echocardiography, and cardiac pathology staining. Fourteen days post-I/R or sham treatment, bone marrow hematopoiesis returned to a steady state with no significant differences in Lin-Sca-1+c-Kit+ (LSK), hematopoietic stem cell (HSC), multipotent progenitor (MPP), and granulocyte/macrophage progenitor (GMP) cell numbers. However, after a secondary ischemic challenge, there was a dampened reactive hematopoiesis indicated by reduced HSPCs, compared to the first ischemic event. BrdU incorporation analysis showed decreased HSPC proliferation activity during the reparative phase after initial ischemic challenge, linking dampened hematopoiesis to decreased HSPCs proliferation. Additionally, early recurrent infarct mice had fewer neutrophils released in peripheral blood and lower serum IL-6 and G-CSF levels. Elevated TGF-β1 levels were detected in bone marrow extracellular fluid during the reparative phase of cardiac-ischemic injury, and inhibiting TGF-β1 reversed the dampened reactive hematopoiesis of HSPCs in an early recurrent MI setting.Our data suggest that initial myocardial ischemia challenges blunt bone marrow reactive hematopoiesis to subsequent ischemic stress, with decreased HSPC proliferation contributing to diminished regenerative capacity. TGF-β1 in bone marrow extracellular fluid may mediate this decreased HSPC proliferation.",
    "PBX1-mediated transcription of AP1M2 promotes triple-negative breast cancer malignant progression and docetaxel resistance.. Cui R, Chen H, Zhao X, Xu S, Fang B (2026). BACKGROUND: Adaptor-related protein complex 1 subunit mu 2 (AP1M2) has been has been shown to be overexpressed in breast cancer tissues. However, whether AP1M2 regulates triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) progression and chemoresistance is unknown. METHODS: The expression of AP1M2 and pre-B-cell leukaemia homeobox 1 (PBX1) was analyzed by qRT-PCR or western blot. Cell proliferation, migration, invasion, docetaxel resistance, and apoptosis were analyzed using CCK8 assay, colony formation assay, EdU assay, transwell assay, wound healing assay and flow cytometry. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to assess the interaction between AP1M2 and PBX1. RESULTS: AP1M2 had increased expression in TNBC cells, and its knockdown suppressed TNBC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and enhanced docetaxel sensitivity. In terms of mechanism, PBX1 bound to AP1M2 promoter region to enhance its transcription. The rescue experiments revealed that overexpression of AP1M2 could abolish the suppressive effect of PBX1 knockdown on TNBC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and docetaxel resistance. CONCLUSION: PBX1-mediated AP1M2 facilitates cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and docetaxel resistance to accelerate TNBC malignant behavior, providing a novel target for TNBC treatment.",
    "KDM5D epigenetically represses FERD3L to inhibit tumor growth in male colorectal cancer.. Yu J, Zhong X, Lan Q, Lan S, Lin S, Qi Y, Su X, Ding J (2026). Colorectal cancer (CRC) exhibits higher incidence and worse prognosis in males, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Epigenetic dysregulation, particularly histone modifications, plays a key role in CRC progression and metastasis. KDM5D, a Y-chromosome-encoded H3K4 demethylase, is frequently downregulated in male-predominant malignancies. Here, we explored the potential tumor-suppressive role of KDM5D and its downstream target FERD3L in male CRC. KDM5D and FERD3L expression were evaluated by immunohistochemistry in tumor and adjacent normal tissues from 60 male CRC patients, with correlations to clinicopathological features and survival analyzed. Functional effects of KDM5D overexpression were assessed in SW480 and HCT116 CRC cell lines using proliferation, colony formation, apoptosis, cell cycle, migration, and invasion assays. In vivo validation was performed in subcutaneous xenograft models. Mechanistic studies included ChIP-qPCR for promoter occupancy and H3K4me3 levels, along with rescue experiments using FERD3L overexpression. KDM5D expression was significantly reduced, while FERD3L was upregulated, in male CRC tumors compared with adjacent normal tissues, showing a strong inverse correlation (P < 0.001). Low KDM5D and high FERD3L levels were associated with advanced stage, lymph node metastasis, and poorer overall survival. KDM5D overexpression inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion while promoting apoptosis and G1 arrest in vitro. In vivo, KDM5D upregulation significantly suppressed subcutaneous tumor growth and promoted apoptosis, as confirmed by TUNEL assays. These effects were accompanied by reduced expression of mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, vimentin) and increased E-cadherin. ChIP-qPCR revealed KDM5D recruitment to the FERD3L proximal promoter with concomitant reduction in H3K4me3 levels upon KDM5D overexpression. FERD3L overexpression partially rescued the suppressive phenotypes induced by KDM5D. KDM5D is recruited to the FERD3L promoter and associated with reduced H3K4me3 marks, correlating with transcriptional repression of FERD3L in male CRC. This axis is linked to the suppression of malignant progression and invasiveness in male CRC cells. These findings suggest a potential epigenetic mechanism contributing to sex-biased CRC behavior, warranting further validation in larger cohorts and functional studies of catalytic dependency.",
    "Immunotherapeutic advances in pediatric neuroblastoma: Overcoming resistance through biomarker-guided combinations.. Shokouhfar M, Darzi A, Ameli F, Nami MT, Khorasani SK, Eini P, Vanan AG, Bahrami N (2026). Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumor in children. It remains a major therapeutic challenge, particularly in high-risk cases where long-term survival rates remain below 50 % despite intensive multimodal treatment. The immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), marked by low MHC class I expression and infiltration of regulatory immune cells, has historically limited the efficacy of immune-based therapies. Recent advances in immunotherapy have reshaped the treatment landscape, with anti-GD2 monoclonal antibodies such as dinutuximab and naxitamab demonstrating significant clinical benefit, especially when combined with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Beyond antibody-based therapies, new modalities are advancing. CAR T-cell platforms targeting GD2, B7-H3, and L1CAM, along with checkpoint inhibitors, cytokine therapies, cancer vaccines, and oncolytic viruses, are showing early promise. However, resistance mechanisms, such as antigen loss, T-cell exhaustion, and suppressive myeloid populations, continue to hinder durable responses. Biomarkers such as Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) mutation status, immune infiltration profiles, and cytokine signatures are increasingly guiding patient stratification and therapeutic personalization. Combination strategies integrating immunotherapy with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and targeted agents have demonstrated synergistic potential, and recent clinical trials reflect a shift toward multi-agent regimens. Novel platforms such as armored CARs, bispecific antibodies, and metabolic modulators are expanding the therapeutic horizon. This review synthesizes current evidence on immunotherapeutic strategies in neuroblastoma, highlighting resistance pathways, biomarker-driven approaches, and the evolving clinical trial landscape. Future directions emphasize personalized, biomarker-guided immunotherapy to improve efficacy, reduce toxicity, and establish durable, curative outcomes for children with neuroblastoma.",
    "Efficacy of three corporotomies to correct ventral penile curvature. Experience in 400 patients with severe hypospadias.. Snodgrass W, Bush N (2026). PURPOSE: We determined the efficacy of 3 corporotomies to straighten ventral curvature (VC) measuring 30-135° during the first stage of a 3-stage STAC repair in patients with proximal hypospadias, as confirmed by artificial erection (AE) at STAC 2 and STAC 3. METHODS: Consecutive males with proximal hypospadias and VC 30° or more underwent primary or reoperative STAC repair. Straightening was done by 3 ventral corporotomies during STAC 1, with AE repeated during STAC 2 and 3, and any reoperations after STAC repair for complications. Residual VC at STAC 2 was straightened by 1 Heineke-Mikulicz dorsal plication. The primary outcome was any ventral curvature. Secondary outcomes included bleeding complications requiring intraoperative or postoperative intervention, and reported change in erection quality in Tanner 4,5 patients. RESULTS: There were 237 primary and 163 reoperative STAC repairs done between 2019 and 2024. VC averaged 74° (median 75°) in primary cases, with 85 % having more than 30-45° and 1 in 4 more than 90°. VC in reoperations was less (p < 0.00001), averaging 54° (median 50°). All patients had at least 2 AE after corporotomies, with the final an average of 17 (11.5-58) months later. 81 % had no VC at STAC 2. Residual VC in the remainder was always 30° or less, was more common in those with >90° initially (p < 0.00001), and was successfully corrected with a single Heineke-Mikulicz dorsal plication in most. Therefore, 99 % of patients were proven by AE to have successful straightening. There were no bleeding complications requiring intervention. One adult reported 15 % decrease in erection fullness. CONCLUSIONS: 3 corporotomies alone were successful in 81 %, which increased to 99 % with a subsequent dorsal plication in those with residual VC. The fact that residual curvature occurs after all straightening methods, including 3 corporotomies, emphasizes need for AE to be repeated at the next operation in staged repairs and during reoperations.",
    "PM2.5 exposure impairs honeybee (Apis mellifera) antennal olfactory perception and gut microbiota structure.. Chi X, Jia L, Wang Y, Hua Q, Xu B (2026). As one of nature's most vital pollinators, honeybees are inevitably exposed to airborne pollutants during foraging. Fine particulate matter (PM2.5, particle < 2.5 μm) poses potential threats to pollinators due to its small particle size, large surface area, high reactivity, and ability to carry toxic substances. For honeybees, the harm caused by the accumulation of PM2.5 on their antennae or in their food is likely underestimated. Here, we exposed Apis mellifera workers to high-concentration PM2.5 (500 μg/m3) to investigate its effects on olfactory perception and gut microbiota. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that PM2.5 acccumulated on honeybee antennal sensilla, and behavioral tests (proboscis extension response) confirmed impaired olfactory sensitivity. 16S rRNA gene sequencing indicated that PM2.5 exposure increased gut microbiota diversity and altered the microbial community structure. Furthermore, PM2.5 induced oxidative stress in the honeybee gut. Integrative correlation analysis linked shifts in specific microbial genus abundances with changes in antioxidant enzyme activities, suggesting that PM2.5 may influence honeybee health and olfactory function via the gut microbiota-gut-brain axis. Our findings provides insights into host-microbiota interactions under environmental stress and implicate airborne pollution as a potential contributor to pollinator decline.",
    "Clinical significance of FoxO1 expression and its regulation in dihydroartemisinin treatment in liver cancer.. Yu Y, Lai S, Zhou Y, Zhang M, Zhang S (2026). BACKGROUND: The transcription factor Forkhead Box O 1 (FoxO1) is crucial to numerous cellular and biological functions. Dihydroartemisinin (DHA) is a derivative of artemisinin extracted from Chinese medicinal plants. The regulatory mechanism of FoxO1 in liver cancer and its relationship with DHA treatment remain unclear. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to investigate the role of FoxO1 in liver cancer and DHA treatment. METHODS: The expression levels of FoxO1 and its correlation with overall survival were evaluated using the public databases and experiments. The regulation of DHA on FoxO1 was investigated by MTT, Western blotting, immunofluorescence staining, colony formation assays, CRISPR/Cas9 and siRNA-mediated gene knockdown. RESULTS: FoxO1 expression was markedly reduced in hepatoma tissues and associated with higher overall survival. FoxO1 expression was diminished in advanced-stage hepatoma tissues. DHA enhanced FoxO1 expression, concomitant with a reduction in p-AKT and its downstream target p-mTORC1. DHA activity was decreased in FoxO1-knockdown cells. Interestingly, knockdown of Sirt2 abolished DHA-induced FoxO1 expression and impaired the anticancer effect of DHA, which may be correlated with FoxO1 ubiquitination regulation. The p38 MAPK signalling pathway is crucial for the tumor-suppressing effects of DHA and the translocation of FoxO1. CONCLUSION: The findings indicated that DHA could impede the development of liver cancer through FoxO1 regulation, suggesting that targeting FoxO1 may represent a promising therapeutic approach for liver cancer treatment.",
    "Effects of different denture cleaning procedures on denture surface and Candida albicans adhesion.. Başkent GY, Aydoğan Ayaz E, İnan C (2026). STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Denture hygiene is essential for oral health as acrylic resin roughness affects Candida albicans adhesion. Cleaning methods may alter surface properties, warranting further research to determine the most effective long-term approach. PURPOSE: The aim of this in vitro study was to compare the effect of different denture cleaning procedures on the surface roughness and Candida adhesion of acrylic resins. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 120 resin specimens were divided into 12 subgroups (n=10), including 3 materials, a heat-polymerized acrylic resin (Meliodent), an autopolymerized acrylic resin (Meliodent Rapid Repair), and a hard reline material (GC Reline Hard) and 4 cleaning methods, distilled water (control group), Corega alkaline peroxide-containing effervescent tablet, brushing, and electrolyzed water. Surface roughness values of the resin specimens were measured using a contact profilometer device before cleaning and after 7, 30, and 90 days. Candida adhesion was measured and colony forming units (CFU/mL) were assessed. Statistical analysis was performed by using 3-way ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni correction for the surface roughness data and the Kruskal-Wallis test for Candida colonization (α=.05). RESULTS: The surface roughness values of the 3 different acrylic resin materials decreased significantly 30 and 90 days after applying the denture cleaning procedures (P<.001). The denture cleaning procedure affected the surface roughness of heat-polymerized (P<.001) and autopolymerized resins after 90 days (P=.002). The surface roughness of the hard reline materials were affected by different cleaning procedures at all time intervals. Candida adhesion was significantly lower in all type of acrylic resin materials after immersion in alkaline peroxide-based cleansing tablets (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: According to the findings of this study, when evaluating surface roughness, the cleaning procedure with electrolyzed water may be an alternative to mechanical cleaning but should be improved in terms of removing Candida adhesion. Chemical cleaning with denture cleaning tablets was found to be optimal for long-term usage.",
    "Validity and reliability of simulation-based assessment tools for European Training Requirement-defined competencies in anaesthesiology: a two-centre observational pilot study.. Angeles-Fite GS, García-Ballester S, Migliorelli F, Gómez-López L, Tena B, Vendrell M, López-Baamonde M, Perdomo JM, Ibañez C, Bergé R, Cuñat T, Schäfer J, Carramiñana A, Panzeri MF, Valero R, Neuhaus C (2026). Despite ongoing efforts to harmonise postgraduate anaesthesiology training across Europe, significant variability persists among national programmes, and a unified certification process is lacking. Simulation is widely used in postgraduate anaesthesiology training, and several validated tools are available to assess both technical and nontechnical skills. However, use of such tools for summative assessments in specialist certification has not yet been established. This prospective, observational pilot study aimed to evaluate the validity and inter-rater reliability of two scenario-specific checklists, a global rating scale (GRS), and the Anaesthetists' Non-Technical Skills (ANTS) tool in assessing competencies defined by the European postgraduate anaesthesiology curriculum. The study was conducted between May and September 2022 at two university hospitals in Germany and Spain. A total of 43 (23 third-year and 20 fourth-year) anaesthesiology trainees completed a knowledge test and managed two simulated perioperative emergencies. Performances were video-recorded and independently assessed by two blinded raters. Fourth-year trainees scored significantly higher than third-year trainees across all tools, providing validity evidence. Inter-rater reliability was moderate for Scenario 1 (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] range: 0.50 to 0.67) and moderate-to-good for Scenario 2 (ICC range: 0.67 to 0.76). These findings suggest that simulation-based assessments using structured tools can validly and reliably evaluate technical and nontechnical competencies outlined in the European anaesthesiology training curriculum. The results support the integration of such assessments into standardised summative evaluation frameworks in European postgraduate education.",
    "Evaluating the Impact of Prophylactic Administration of Ivermectin on the Fecal Microbiome of Healthy C57BL/6J Mice (Mus musculus).. Pope CE, Jones RM, Rashied AA, Nagy T, Hanson WH (2026). Upon importation, laboratory mice may undergo prophylactic antiparasitic treatment during quarantine to prevent the introduction of parasites into established colonies. While quarantine protocols vary across institutions, ivermectin is commonly used, administered either orally or topically. However, the impact of these practices on the fecal microbiome remains poorly understood, raising concerns about unintended consequences for experimental outcomes. This study investigated the effects of ivermectin on fecal microbiome composition in naïve, healthy male and female C57BL/6J mice. Animals received either ivermectin-impregnated feed (12 ppm, ad libitum for 4 weeks), weekly topical ivermectin solution (2.0 mg/kg for 4 weeks), or no treatment (controls). Fecal samples were collected for 16S rRNA-based microbiome analysis before ivermectin treatment, immediately posttreatment, and 4 weeks after treatment cessation. Weekly body weights were recorded, and histopathologic evaluation of the small intestine and colon was performed at study completion. Both oral and topical ivermectin treatments resulted in significant alterations in microbiome α and β diversity at the end of treatment, with more pronounced effects observed in female mice. Some of these changes persisted for up to 4 weeks after treatment cessation. Furthermore, the findings indicate a sex-specific effect of ivermectin on specific bacterial orders, with Bacillales predominantly affected in male mice, whereas Coriobacteriales and Bacteriodales were primarily impacted in female mice. During treatment, males receiving topical ivermectin weighed significantly less than controls, while females receiving dietary ivermectin weighed significantly more. Histopathological analysis revealed no abnormalities in intestinal tissues across all groups at 4 weeks posttreatment. These findings demonstrate that ivermectin administration induces measurable and persistent changes in the fecal microbiome of healthy mice. Researchers should consider these effects when designing experiments, and institutions must weigh the benefits of colony protection against potential microbiome-related confounding variables.",
    "Antibacterial and demineralisation-inhibiting properties of silver complex fluoride on dentine caries: an in vitro study.. Xu GY, Yin IX, Zhao IS, Lung CY, Lo EC, Chu CH (2026). OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate the antibacterial and demineralisation-inhibiting effects of a non-discolouring silver complex fluoride (SCF) on artificial dentine caries. METHODS: Dentine blocks with artificial carious lesions were treated with SCF, silver diamine fluoride (SDF, as positive control), and water (as negative control). Then the blocks underwent Streptococcus mutans biofilm and pH-cycling for 7 days. The morphology, viability and growth kinetics of the biofilm were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and colony-forming unit (CFU) counting, respectively. The dentine surface morphology, lesion depths and mineral loss, chemical structure and crystal characteristics were determined using SEM, micro-computed tomography, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD), respectively. One-way analysis of variance with the Bonferroni post hoc test was performed to assess and compare the data. RESULTS: SEM revealed confluent bacterial growth covering the surface of dentine treated with water but not SCF and SDF. CLSM showed that the dead-to-live ratios of biofilms treated with SCF, SDF, and water were 0.77 ± 0.16, 0.88 ± 0.40, and 0.44 ± 0.03, respectively (p < 0.001, SCF, SDF>Water). The Log CFU values of the biofilm treated with SCF, SDF and water were 6.7 ± 0.1, 6.6 ± 0.2 and 7.8 ± 0.1 (p < 0.001, SCF, SDF<Water). SEM images showed Group SCF had less exposed dentine collagen fibers than Group Water. Micro-computed tomography showed the lesion-depth (μm) of dentine treated with SCF, SDF and water were 40±5, 35±8 and 180±20 (p < 0.001, SCF, SDF<Water). The mineral loss (gHApcm-3) of dentine treated with SCF, SDF and water were 0.24±0.05, 0.20±0.03 and 0.45±0.03 (p < 0.001, SCF, SDF<Water). FTIR showed the amide I-to-hydrogen phosphate ratios of dentine treated with SCF, SDF and water were 0.25±0.03, 0.22±0.03, and 0.43±0.05 (p < 0.001, SCF, SDF<Water). XRD revealed that the hydroxyapatite in SDF and SCF groups was better crystallised than that of water Group. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that SCF inhibited the growth of S. mutans biofilm and reduced the demineralisation of artificial dentine caries. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: If SCF is successfully translated into clinical application, it may be a novel anti-caries agent for clinicians to arrest dentine caries.",
    "Time- and dose-dependent effects of bacterial infection on iron metabolism, inflammation, and oxidative stress in the juvenile soft-shelled turtle Pelodiscus sinensis.. Lu Y, Zhang Y, Niu C (2026). Pathogen-induced high mortality is a severe problem in turtle cultures. Increasing evidence indicates that pathogenic infection may disrupt iron homeostasis, thereby creating a vicious cycle of iron imbalance-inflammation-oxidative stress. However, the effects of infection on iron metabolism and related physiological traits in turtles remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the response of iron metabolism in juvenile soft-shelled turtles (Pelodiscus sinensis) under acute bacterial challenge and its association with inflammation and oxidative stress. We intraperitoneally injected juvenile P. sinensis (108 ± 2.5 g) with the recently identified pathogen Elizabethkingia anophelis at concentrations of 0, 3.24 × 107, 8.10 × 107, and 1.62 × 108 colony-forming units per millilitre (CFU/mL) in a volume of 0.2 mL. We sampled at 6, 24, and 120 h postinjection to assess the physiological responses to bacterial invasion. The results revealed that haemolysis developed as time progressed and the bacterial dose increased, accompanied by a decrease in plasma iron concentration. Moreover, the expression levels of iron metabolism-related genes in the liver and spleen-hepcidin, transferrin, TFR1, and FTH1-increased, whereas FPN1 expression decreased, concurrent with elevated tissue iron levels. Oxidative stress levels and the expression of proinflammatory cytokine genes were positively correlated with tissue iron accumulation. Overall, acute E. anophelis infection disrupts iron homeostasis in P. sinensis in a dose- and time-dependent manner, promotes the redistribution of iron from the circulation to storage tissues, exacerbates tissue inflammatory responses, and reduces antioxidant capacity. These findings indicate that dysregulated iron homeostasis plays a central role in infection-associated tissue injury and that restoring iron balance may aid in the treatment of bacterial infections in P. sinensis.",
    "Extracellular DNA in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid as a candidate biomarker of disease severity in autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis.. Kimura T, Imamura K, Yoshida C, Tomita Y, Sakagami T (2026). BACKGROUND: Autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (aPAP) results from the neutralization of autoantibodies against granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, which leads to alveolar macrophage (AM) dysfunction and surfactant accumulation. However, disease progression cannot be solely explained by surfactant overload. This study aimed to investigate whether defective efferocytosis in aPAP contributes to persistent apoptotic debris and accumulation of extracellular double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), which is a candidate biomarker of disease severity. METHODS: We analyzed bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples obtained from 13 patients with aPAP and 13 patients with other interstitial lung diseases (controls). Apoptotic debris was assessed cytologically, extracellular dsDNA was quantified fluorometrically with urea correction, and efferocytosis was evaluated using flow cytometry. Additionally, we analyzed correlations between BALF dsDNA levels and clinical indices. RESULTS: BALF samples from patients with aPAP contained abundant apoptotic debris and significantly higher dsDNA levels than those from controls. Further, AMs from patients with aPAP showed s markedly reduced uptake apoptotic cells, indicating altered efferocytosis-related processes. Corrected BALF dsDNA levels were negatively correlated with the arterial oxygen pressure to inspired oxygen fraction ratio and percent predicted diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide. CONCLUSIONS: Altered efferocytosis-related processes in patients with aPAP may promote the accumulation of apoptotic debris and extracellular DNA in the alveolar space. Further, dsDNA levels in BALF strongly reflect impaired gas exchange and provide a biomarker of disease severity. These findings further elucidate the pathogenesis of aPAP and establish extracellular DNA as a promising tool for disease monitoring and therapeutic evaluation.",
    "Isoginkgetin inhibits non-small cell lung cancer by inducing oxidative stress and regulating M1 macrophage polarization.. Zhu C, Zhang F, Li X, Xing D, Cai H, Wang X, Qu H, Li L, Zheng X (2026). BACKGROUND: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which constitutes approximately 85% of all lung cancer cases, is a leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Isoginkgetin (ISO), a biflavonoid isolated from Ginkgo biloba leaves, has demonstrated anticancer effects against various malignancies. However, its anti-NSCLC effects are unclear. OBJECTIVE: To explore the therapeutic potential of ISO and its mechanism of suppressing NSCLC proliferation. To provide experimental evidence for the translational potential of ISO as a candidate clinical drug. METHODS: Cell cytotoxicity and proliferation were assessed by cell viability, propidium iodide staining, colony formation, and cell cycle detection assays. Cell migration was evaluated by wound healing and transwell assays. Reactive oxygen species and the mitochondrial membrane potential were detected by fluorescent staining. Malondialdehyde and glutathione content were quantified by commercial assay kits. Transcriptome analysis for exploring the mechanism of ISO inhibition in NSCLC. The relationships between ISO and the tribbles pseudokinase 3 (TRIB3)/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway were investigated through Western blot, siRNA-mediated TRIB3 knockdown, and overexpression of TRIB3. Cellular thermal shift assay and surface plasmon resonance were explored to investigate the binding and direct interaction between ISO and TRIB3. A non-contact co-culture model of NSCLC cells and macrophages was used to assess macrophage polarization. The anti-NSCLC effect of ISO in vivo was evaluated in a BALB/c nude mouse subcutaneous tumor model. RESULTS: ISO suppressed the cell viability, proliferation, and migration of NSCLC cells. ISO induces oxidative stress in NSCLC cells, characterized by an increase in reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde and a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential and glutathione. ISO has a strong binding affinity and direct interaction for the TRIB3 protein. Furthermore, ISO inhibited the antioxidant Nrf2 pathway by suppressing TRIB3 expression. Mechanistically, TRIB3 knockdown or overexpression significantly regulated the levels of oxidative stress and the Nrf2 pathway. ISO also promoted M1 macrophage polarization. Furthermore, ISO suppressed tumor growth in vivo. CONCLUSION: ISO inhibits NSCLC through direct targeting and downregulation of TRIB3, thereby inducing oxidative stress and suppressing the antioxidant Nrf2 pathway. Furthermore, ISO regulates the tumor microenvironment by promoting M1 macrophage polarization. These findings may contribute to improved prognosis for NSCLC patients and provide insights into the mechanism of ISO as an antitumor drug, thereby supporting its potential for clinical translation.",
    "Application of culturomics to explore the cultivable microbiota and enable targeted bacterial isolation from the ceca of broiler chickens.. Wang M, Ye X, Hsu CY, Fugate H, Zhang X, Adhikari PA, Fan P, Elliott K, Macklin K, Zhang L (2026). Metagenomic analyses have significantly advanced our understanding of microbial composition in the poultry gut. However, many microbes identified through metagenomic studies remain uncultured, largely due to the lack of understanding of their cultivation conditions, which hinders efforts to explore their functional roles in gut health and metabolism. In this study, we performed culturomics, a culture-dependent approach that combines diverse culture conditions with high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing, to comprehensively assess the cultivability of chicken cecal microbiota and provide guidance for isolating target species of interest. Microbial profiling was performed using both culture-dependent (CD) and culture-independent (CI) approaches. For CI, genomic DNA (gDNA) was directly extracted from six broiler chicken cecal samples and subjected to full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing. For CD, the same samples were cultured under 28 conditions, yielding 161 colony mixtures for sequencing. Based on diversity profiles of the colony mixtures, 10 conditions were selected for single-colony isolation and analysis. Results showed that CD and CI approaches identified 350 and 502 bacterial species, respectively, with 160 species detected by both methods. The dominant species recovered by the CD approach,including Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Limosilactobacillus reuteri, Enterococcus faecalis, and Ligilactobacillus salivarius, were detected at much lower abundances in the CI analysis, highlighting the capacity of culturomics to enrich and recover minority taxa that are often poorly detected by CI apparoach. Cultivation profiling showed that MRS selectively enriched Limosilactobacillus and Ligilactobacillus as well as Lactobacillus, whereas CNAB and MSA enriched Enterococcus and Bacillus, respectively. Community diversity and structure were significantly influenced by culture conditions (P < 0.01), with medium as the primary factor and air condition as a secondary factor. Subsequent single-colony analysis from 10 selected culture conditions identified 150 single-species isolates belonging to 14 distinct bacterial species. This study provides foundational insight into the cultivability of chicken cecal microbiota, facilitating future research to isolate specific strains and characterize their roles in poultry health and nutrition.",
    "Feeding live or processed black soldier fly larvae to slow-growing broilers impacts their behaviour differently.. Dörper A, Nicolai K, Gort G, de Jong IC, van Harn J, Veldkamp T, Dicke M (2026). In response to increasing public concerns and retailer demands, the broiler production industry and legislative authorities are looking for measures to improve broiler welfare. Black soldier fly (BSF) larvae could be used in broiler diets as these insects contain bioactive compounds that may improve broiler health. The underlying pathways of these bioactive compounds to support broiler health are not fully understood yet. However, experimental evidence indicates that BSF larvae as part of laying hen diets can lead to improved disease resistance and immune response in those chickens, based on improved blood biochemical profiles. Moreover, BSF larvae may trigger natural behaviour through visual cues, potentially stimulating natural foraging behaviour and pecking towards larvae. BSF larvae products (live and processed), varying in physical and nutritional properties, may affect broiler health and welfare differently based on product choice and inclusion level (low and high). The purpose of this study was to investigate whether BSF larvae products as part of slow-growing broiler (Hubbard JA757) diets or rations can contribute to better health and welfare. Therefore, the following BSF larvae products were tested at two inclusion levels: live larvae (L), a combination of BSF larvae meal and fat (MO) mimicking the nutritional composition of the live larvae, and BSF larvae meal (M) and fat (O) separately. Each treatment group was replicated 8 times with 24 broilers per replicate. The experimental diets were provided to the 1-day-old chickens until 51 days of age. The health of the broilers was quantified based on blood biochemical parameters and weight and length of intestinal organs, while the welfare of the broilers was quantified based on physical welfare scores, behavioural observations, and activity tracking. Feeding live BSF larvae to broilers affected their behaviour, leading to broilers showing more eating, locomotion, and active behaviour, while showing less resting and foraging behaviour compared to broilers receiving only compound feed with or without processed BSF larvae products. Biochemical blood parameters and dimensions of intestinal organs did not differ between the control group and treatment groups containing BSF larvae products. Based on our results, the insect product form, feeding live larvae rather than processed larvae, seems to stimulate eating and active behaviour in broilers, while inclusion level seems to play a less important role. We therefore recommend to use low quantities of live BSF larvae in broiler diets to improve activity in modern broiler production systems.",
    "In-Situ sulfur implantation efficiently promoting nitrogen removal in low-carbon anoxic-oxic systems.. Xu JM, Gu M, Zhang YF, Zhang G, Lv JQ, Wang YQ, Chen Y, Zhang G, Ren D, Ba X, Gao B, Cheng HY (2026). Efficient total nitrogen (TN) removal from low-carbon wastewater remains challenging due to electron donor scarcity, often causing incomplete denitrification and nitrite accumulation. To address this, an in-situ sulfur-enhanced anoxic/oxic (HS0AD-A/O) system was established, enabling S0-driven electron redistribution for enhanced TN removal without additional carbon input or process restructuring. Under decreasing influent C/N ratios (4 to 2), HS0AD-A/O outperformed conventional HD-A/O by 32.76-111.16% of TN removal efficiency. Electron balance showed S0 oxidation contributed 9.21-27.59% of total electron flux, compensating for carbon deficiency. Increasing the S0 implantation ratio to 28% shifted the dominant pathway toward S0-based autotrophic denitrification, where S0-derived electrons surpassed those from COD (58.27% vs. 41.73%). Kinetic assays revealed that S0-driven denitrification preferentially reduced NO2⁻ over NO3⁻, thereby minimizing NO2⁻ accumulation and yielding a distinct S0‑saving effect (1.14-1.57 g-S0/g-N here). Microbial and transcriptional analyses further elucidated a synergistic division of labor: heterotrophic denitrifiers (e.g., Hydrogenophaga, Rhodocyclaceae) in sludge primarily reduced NO3⁻-N but tended to cause partial denitrification, whereas S0-attached autotrophs (e.g., Thiobacillus, up to 46.10% in biofilms) specialize in complete denitrification and efficiently converted NO2⁻-N to N2, accompanied by marked upregulation of nirKS and nosZ genes. Overall, in-situ S0 implantation restructured electron transfer networks, enabling stable, efficient, and dual-saving (carbon and S0) TN removal while providing mechanistic insight for scalable applications.",
    "Influence of co-registration on lesion characterization in diffusion-weighted breast MRI.. Brock L, Liebert A, Schreiter H, Skwierawska D, Ehring C, Eberle J, Heidarikahkesh S, Laun FB, Uder M, Kapsner L, Lach J, Wenkel E, Ohlmeyer S, Hadler D, Knoll F, Bickelhaupt S (2026). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate if co-registering Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI) before generating Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) maps can improve differentiating benign and malignant breast lesions in MRI based on the A6702 thresholds. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This IRB-approved study involved an in-house dataset and the publicly available ACRIN-6698 dataset, both including multi b-value DWI. In phase one, 16 ANTs library-based co-registration methods were evaluated on a subset of n = 138 cases from our in-house cohort. The quantitative assessment included mean ADC values of manually segmented lesions (diagnostic metrics using individual and A6702-defined thresholds) and coefficient of Variation. In the second phase, the best-performing methods were tested for generalizability on an unseen set of 40 cases (20 from in-house and 20 from external dataset). Three blinded readers segmented lesions on co-registered and non-co-registered ADC maps. Agreement and consistency were evaluated via Bland-Altman, segmentation distance, and intraclass correlation coefficient. RESULTS: Rigid co-registration using DWI at b = 750 s/mm2 as reference (b750-Rigid) improved accuracy of both optimal/conservative A6702 trial thresholds with sensitivity/specificity increasing from 93%/10% to 97%/30% and 100%/30% respectively. Mean ADC values were not significantly different after co-registration (p > 0.05). DISCUSSION: Co-registration of DWI images before ADC map generation, particularly using b750-Rigid registration, seems promising for improving lesion classification in breast MRI. Further validation is warranted.",
    "In vitro assessment of siRNA-mediated LRP5 silencing and temozolomide treatment in glioblastoma and brain cancer stem cells.. Kucuk A, Caglar HO, Karatas OF, Biray Avci C, Gunduz C (2026). Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5), a co-receptor of frizzled (FZD) in the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway, recognizes Wnt ligands. This study aimed to assess the anti-cancer effects of silencing LRP5 on glioblastoma (GBM) and brain cancer stem cells (BCSCs). Additionally, the effect of temozolomide (TMZ) was also examined in these cells with suppressed LRP5 expression. LRP5 expression was silenced in U87MG, T98G, and BCSC cells using siRNA. Protein expression levels were determined by Western blotting. Cell viability after LRP5 silencing and/or TMZ treatment was evaluated using the CVDK-8 assay. Flow cytometry was used to examine apoptosis and cell cycle progression. Clonogenic, cell invasion, and wound-healing assays were used to assess colony formation, invasion, and migration, respectively. siRNA-mediated silencing reduced protein expression of LRP5 and Wnt/β-catenin target genes in GBM and BCSC cells. Furthermore, suppression of LRP5 reduced cell viability, and its combination with TMZ enhanced anti-proliferative effects. Silencing LRP5 and/or TMZ treatment caused cell cycle arrest and significantly diminished the aggressive characteristics of GBM and BCSC cells. These findings suggest that LRP5 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for treating GBM. Targeting LRP5 may enhance the effectiveness of the chemotherapy agent TMZ in GBM.",
    "Emergence of Fusarium oxysporum infection in farmed Labeo rohita: Isolation, growth requirements, antifungal response, and pathogenic potential.. Chouhan N, Mohapatra S, Saha H, Dekari D, Shah TK (2026). Fusarium oxysporum, was isolated from a naturally infected captive-reared Labeo rohita in Tripura, India. The infected fish exhibited clinical signs of fungal growth with haemorrhage on the ventral body surface and erosion of the caudal fin. Morphological identification of fungal colony, including microscopic observation of 5-day-old culture, revealed the presence of multi-septate macroconidia and one-septate microconidia. Growth requirement study revealed that the fungus grew best at 30 °C and pH 6.0. In vitro studies revealed that the isolate produced extracellular enzymes such as caseinase, lipase, starch hydrolase and DNase, which contributed to its pathogenicity. The partial 18 S gene sequence was assigned NCBI accession number PQ013739.1 and confirmed its identity as F. oxysporum. Pathogenicity test by intraperitoneal injection of fungal spore suspension in healthy L. rohita fingerlings with fungal growth at the site of injection; LD50 value obtained by probit analysis was 4.85 × 107 spores/ml. Antifungal susceptibility testing indicated that none of amphotericin B, ketoconazole, itraconazole, clotrimazole, and nystatin produced zones of inhibition against the fungal isolate. In contrast, the fungus exhibited sensitivity to sodium chloride and copper sulfate, with reduced radial growth at salinity levels exceeding 0.5% and CuSO4 concentrations above 25 ppm. Our findings confirm that the F. oxysporum strain is virulent to L. rohita, and highlights the potential utility of salinity and copper sulfate-based management strategies for control of this fungus in aquaculture.",
    "A combined computational and functional approach identifies FBLN5 as an amino acid metabolism-related gene and suppressing colorectal cancer progression.. Chen J, Bai Y, Liu S, Lin C (2026). The importance of amino acid metabolism in regulating cancers progression was investigated by accumulating research. But the role of amino acid metabolism-related genes (AAMRGs) played in the colorectal cancer (CRC) progression remains unclear. We used Cox-LASSO analysis to construct an AAMRG prognostic signature and performed Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) for further investigation. Moreover, RT‒qPCR was adopted to estimate the expression of AAMRGs in clinical samples. Cell-based assays, including CCK-8, colony formation, and transwell assays were also performed to identify the roles of fibulin 5 (FBLN5) in CRC progression. We established a 10-AAMRG prognostic signature and stratified CRC samples into two risk groups, which showed significant differences in immune infiltration and EMT. RT-qPCR and human protein atlas data confirmed the mRNA and protein expression of these 10 AAMRGs, validating our bioinformatics findings. Importantly, functional assays revealed that FBLN5 overexpression suppressed CRC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro, as well as tumor growth in vivo. Our study establishes a novel 10-AAMRG signature as a promising predictor of therapeutic response and prognosis in CRC, and we identify FBLN5 as a pivotal protective factor in CRC progression, offering potential therapeutic value for targeted interventions.",
    "The MDM2-IL-33 Axis Promotes Gastric Tumorigenesis via K63 Ubiquitination-Dependent ERK/JNK Activation.. Huang N, Zan X, Liu L, Li W, Zhang C (2026). This study uncovers a novel post-translational regulatory mechanism through which MDM2 stabilizes IL-33 via K63-linked ubiquitination, thus facilitating the progression of gastric cancer. Using MKN45 and AGS gastric cancer cells, we conducted MDM2 knockdown followed by qPCR and Western blot to evaluate IL-33 regulation. Co-IP and cycloheximide chase assays verified MDM2-IL-33 binding and stabilization. Ubiquitination assays using WT and mutant (K63R/K48-only) ubiquitin identified MDM2-dependent K63-linked polyubiquitination of IL-33. A subcutaneous xenograft tumor model in nude mice was established to validate the oncogenic role of the MDM2-IL-33 axis in vivo. Functional assays (CCK-8, colony formation, Transwell, and wound healing) revealed MDM2's requirement for IL-33-mediated oncogenic effects. Western blots showed MDM2-IL-33 axis modulates apoptosis (Bcl-2/Bax/Caspase-3) and ERK signaling (p-ERK/p-JNK). We have demonstrated that knocked down MDM2 significantly decreases IL-33 protein levels without influencing its mRNA expression, suggesting that the regulation occurred at the post-translational stage. Co-immunoprecipitation assays have confirmed the physical interaction between MDM2 and IL-33 in gastric cancer cell lines, namely MKN45 and AGS. Meanwhile, ubiquitination assays have revealed that MDM2 specifically mediated the K63-linked polyubiquitination of IL-33, thereby enhancing its stability. Functionally, overexpressing IL-33 promoted malignant phenotypes in gastric cancer cells, such as increased cell viability, enhanced clonogenic growth, and augmented invasion and migration capabilities. Intriguingly, depleting MDM2 effectively abolished these promoting effects. Mechanistically, the MDM2-IL-33 axis exerted its influence by suppressing apoptosis through modulating the expression of Bcl-2/Bax/Caspase-3, and by activating the oncogenic ERK/JNK signaling pathway. Crucially, MDM2 overexpression promoted tumor growth, which was effectively reversed by transfection with si-MDM2. These findings firmly established MDM2 as a crucial regulator of IL-33 stability and highlighted the significant therapeutic potential of targeting the MDM2-IL-33 interaction to impede gastric cancer progression.",
    "Genomics and reproductive biology of Leptopilina malgretoutensis (sp. nov.): an asexual parasitoid of Caribbean Drosophila.. Lindsey ARI, Lue CH, Davis JS, Borjon LJ, Mauthner SE, Fricke LC, Youtsey A, Eads L, Murphy M, Drown MK, Faulk C, Buffington ML, Tracey WD Jr (2026). Drosophila and parasitic wasps in the genus Leptopilina have long been a model for understanding host-parasite interactions. Indeed, parasitic wasps are important drivers of ecological and evolutionary processes broadly, but we are generally lacking information about the diversity, natural history, and evolution of these relationships. We collected insects from the Caribbean Island of Saint Lucia, home to the eastern Caribbean dunni subgroup of Drosophila: a clade long appreciated for its recent patterns of speciation and adaptation. Here we present an integrative approach that incorporates natural history, taxonomy, physiology, and genomics to describe Leptopilina malgretoutensis Buffington, Lue, Davis & Tracey sp. nov. (Hymenoptera: Figitidae), a virulent parasitoid of dunni group flies, specifically Drosophila antillea. Leptopilina malgretoutensis is nested within an early-branching clade of Leptopilina, offering insights into the evolution of this important genus of Drosophila parasitoids. We present a high-quality assembly for this wasp's 1Gbp genome, and for its bacterial endosymbiont: Wolbachia strain \"wLmal\". Furthermore, we show that wLmal induces parthenogenesis in the wasp, and that these wasps are reliant upon their Wolbachia infections to produce female offspring. Finally, comparisons to historical museum specimens indicated that Leptopilina malgretoutensis had been collected approximately 40 years prior from the nearby island of Guadeloupe, and these wasps were also asexually reproducing. This work represents one of only a handful of studies in which field biology, taxonomy, systematics, genomics, and experimental biology are integrated into a species description: showcasing the possibilities for biodiversity research in the genomic era.",
    "Mathematical Modeling of the Role of Cytokines in Sindbis Virus Treatment of Glioblastoma.. Makam S, Dobrovolny HM (2026). Oncolytic viruses, specifically Sindbis virus (SINV), combined with cytokines show promising results in slowing glioma progression, but a quantitative understanding of their effects remains limited. In this study, we use an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model to examine the effect of adding cytokines to oncolytic SINV therapy. We fit the mathematical model to data extracted from published tumor growth curves to estimate key model parameters. We find that there are statistically significant differences between the infection rates of SINV and cytokine-bearing SINV, as well as differences in the cytokine's ability to reduce viral production. Model simulations show that the addition of cytokines causes an almost immediate reduction in the tumor size caused by the increased viral infection rate. The simultaneous reduction in viral production caused by the cytokines results in oscillations in virus, cytokines, and tumor volume. By providing parameter estimates for key biological processes, our model can help optimize treatment strategies and guide future research in oncolytic virotherapy.",
    "RORγ drives non-small cell lung cancer progression by upregulating the NGF signaling.. Zeng Y, Cai G, Zhang J, Zhang Z, Yin W, Ou T, Xu M, Li J, Kang Z, Bu J, Wang J, Huang J, Feng W (2026). BACKGROUND: Lung cancer remains one of the most prevalent and lethal malignancies worldwide, with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) representing the most common subtype-highlighting the critical need for novel therapeutic approaches. The retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor gamma (RORγ) has been implicated in various cancers, but its role and mechanism in NSCLC remain unclear. METHODS: RORγ expression and its correlation with patient prognosis in NSCLC were assessed by integrating public database bioinformatics analysis, immunohistochemistry, and Western blot. The functional roles of RORγ in NSCLC proliferation, migration, and invasion were determined in vitro through genetic overexpression, pharmacological inhibition, or genetic silencing of RORγ, assessed by cell counting, colony formation, wound healing, and transwell assays. The underlying mechanism was investigated using RNA sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and rescue experiments with exogenous nerve growth factor (NGF) supplementation or NGF overexpression. In vivo, the anti-tumor efficacy of RORγ inhibition was evaluated using subcutaneous xenograft and experimental metastasis models. RESULTS: We identify RORγ as a key driver of NSCLC progression. Integrative bioinformatics and immunohistochemical analysis revealed that RORγ is highly expressed in NSCLC tissues and that its expression correlates with poor patient prognosis. Functionally, elevated RORγ significantly enhanced the proliferation, migration, and invasion capabilities of NSCLC cells. Conversely, treatment with the RORγ antagonist or genetic silencing of RORγ potently suppressed these malignant phenotypes both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, RORγ directly binds to the promoter region of NGF, stimulates NGF gene transcription, and thereby promotes NSCLC progression. RORγ antagonists suppress NGF expression and inhibit its downstream signaling pathways, whereas exogenous NGF supplementation or overexpression of NGF notably reverses the inhibitory effects of RORγ antagonists on NSCLC cells. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these results establish RORγ as a critical regulator of NSCLC and a promising therapeutic target for NSCLC treatment.",
    "The METTL3-IGF2BP3 axis drives osteosarcoma progression by enhancing ID1 mRNA stability.. Shu R, Cheng Q, Yu Z, Zhou H, Lin M, Shi M, Chen J, Chen J, Zhao M (2026). OBJECTIVE: Osteosarcoma (OS) is a highly aggressive malignant bone tumor. While ID1 plays a critical role in OS progression, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigates the METTL3-IGF2BP3 axis-mediated N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification in regulating ID1 mRNA stability and its functional implications in OS. METHODS: RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) associated with ID1 were predicted using the ENCORI database. Differentially expressed RBP genes (RBP-DEGs) were screened via the GSE253548 dataset, and core RBP-DEGs were identified using machine learning algorithms. m6A modification sites on ID1 mRNA were predicted by SRAMP, while the interaction between METTL3/IGF2BP3 and ID1 was analyzed via the RM2Target database. Functional experiments including CCK-8, colony formation, wound healing, and Transwell assays were performed to assess OS cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Mechanistic insights were validated through MeRIP-qPCR, RIP-qPCR, RNA stability assays, and dual-luciferase reporter experiments. Additionally, a subcutaneous xenograft mouse model of OS was established to evaluate tumor growth, with tumor volume/weight and Ki67 expression monitored. RESULTS: Bioinformatics analysis identified METTL3 and IGF2BP3 as core regulators of ID1, with elevated ID1, IGF2BP3, and METTL3 expression observed in OS cells. Mechanistically, IGF2BP3 enhanced ID1 mRNA stability by binding to m6A-modified ID1 transcripts, while METTL3 catalyzed ID1 mRNA m6A modification to strengthen IGF2BP3-ID1 interaction. Cellular assays demonstrated that the METTL3-IGF2BP3 axis significantly promoted OS cell proliferation, migration, and invasion via m6A-dependent ID1 stabilization. In vivo studies further confirmed that this axis accelerated OS tumor growth by upregulating ID1 expression. CONCLUSION: The METTL3-IGF2BP3 axis facilitates OS progression by enhancing ID1 mRNA stability and expression, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target.",
    "Fatty acids from Hermetia illucens larvae disrupt membrane integrity in colistin-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii.. Mohamed H, Leonov S, Marusich E (2026). BACKGROUND: The overuse and prolonged application of antibiotics have led to the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens, notably Acinetobacter baumannii, a leading cause of nosocomial infections and increased mortality in healthcare settings. In natural conditions, fatty acids possess well-documented antibacterial activity. This research investigates an eco-friendly way to extract fat from Hermetia illucens (HI) larvae to analyze its antimicrobial properties against colistin-resistant A. baumannii ATCC 19606. METHODS: Larval fat from H. illucens was processed using a sustainable extraction protocol to yield multiple fractions. Antibacterial activity was assessed via disc diffusion and broth microdilution assays. The most potent fraction, acidic water methanol extract 3 (AWME3), was further evaluated for inhibition zone diameter, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), MIC50, and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). Salt tolerance assays were conducted under 0-10% NaCl conditions to assess robustness. Morphological and intracellular changes were examined using electron microscopy. RESULTS: Among the obtained fractions, the third acidic water methanol extract (AWME3) demonstrated the highest activity against A. baumannii ATCC 19606. AWME3 exhibited a clear inhibition zone of 18.1 ± 0.35 mm at 20 mg/mL. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), MIC50, and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were found to be 380 µg/mL, 222 µg/mL, and 380 µg/mL, respectively. Complete inhibition of colony formation was observed at both MIC and 2×MIC levels under NaCl concentrations ranging from 0 to 10%. Electron microscopy revealed that fatty acids severely damaged bacterial cell walls and membranes, increasing permeability and causing leakage of cell contents, leading to cell death. CONCLUSIONS: Fatty acid-enriched extracts from H. illucens larvae, particularly AWME3, exhibited potent antibacterial activity against colistin-resistant A. baumannii, likely through membrane-disruptive mechanisms. These findings highlight the potential of insect-derived bioactive compounds as sustainable alternatives for managing MDR pathogens.",
    "Influence of S-PRG-based restorative and adhesive systems on biofilm formation and enamel demineralization in a simulated oral environment.. de Carvalho LF, Badaró MM, Stolf SC, Maske TT, Marques GÁ, da Cunha LM, Longaray JS, Peña CLD, Lund RG, de Andrade JSR (2026). OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the impact of bioactive restorative materials on biofilm formation and cariogenic processes using an in vitro dynamic cariogenic biofilm model simulated by a Multifunctional Oral Cavity Simulator. The experimental design included composite resins and adhesive systems containing S-PRG particles (Beautifil and FL-Bond II – Shofu), compared against a conventional composite (Filtek Z350XT – 3 M ESPE) and a conventional adhesive system (Clearfil SE Bond – Kuraray). METHODS: Samples were exposed to a controlled cariogenic environment and analyzed for colony-forming unit (CFU) counting, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), microhardness, and chemical modifications by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). One-way ANOVA and Tukey’s post hoc test was performed (α = 0.05). RESULTS: CFU counting and SEM analysis revealed no significant differences in biofilm volume or microbial counts among groups (P > 0.05), indicating no reduction with bioactive materials. FTIR analysis showed a marked reduction in phosphate and carbonate absorption peaks compared to sound enamel, indicating a similar demineralization pattern regardless of material. Microhardness analysis revealed no significant differences among materials (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our findings did not reveal superior protection of bioactive materials containing S-PRG particles against cariogenic challenges. In this context, more robust clinical evidence is still needed to confirm the effectiveness of bioactive materials in enhancing restoration longevity and caries control. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Under dynamic cariogenic conditions, S-PRG-based materials performed similarly to conventional restoratives materials. These findings indicate that the purported bioactivity may not result in measurable clinical benefits.

    "Comparison of PDT using a 660 nm laser and methylene blue vs. an 810 nm laser and indocyanine green on different Candida species - in vitro.. Norouzbeigi M, Shirani AM, Tahmourespour A (2026). INTRODUCTION: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) offers broad-spectrum antifungal effects with lower resistance in some studies. This study evaluates the effectiveness of two PDT protocols, using a 660 nm diode laser with methylene blue (MB) compared to an 810 nm diode laser with indocyanine green (ICG), in reducing colony counts of Candida albicans, C. glabrata, C. tropicalis, and C. krusei. METHODS: This experimental laboratory study tested 4 standard Candida species in seven groups (2 PDT, 2 photosensitizers alone, 2 lasers wavelength with saline, 1 control with saline) each containing five replicates per species. PDT was performed using MB with a 660 nm diode laser and ICG with an 810 nm diode laser. Laser exposure setting was 100 mW, 10 J/cm², 100 s. CFUs were quantified, and statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 26, with significance set at P < 0.05. RESULTS: PDT had better efficacy for colony count reduction of C. tropicalis, and C. krusei. PDT with an 810 nm diode laser and ICG had better efficacy than PDT with 660 nm diode laser and MB but difference was not significant (P > 0.05). For some candida species there was no significant difference between PDT with laser alone for colony reduction but there was significant difference between them with each photosensitizer and saline alone (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Both PDT had better efficacy for colony count reduction of C. tropicalis, and C. krusei compare to other two species. PDT with diode 810 nm and ICG seems better than PDT with diode 660 nm and MB, but the difference was not statistical between two methods.",
    "HDACi induces apoptosis of osteosarcoma cells by inhibiting the MAPK pathway.. Qin C, Lin TT, Lin YM, Zhang YL, Hong SJ, Jia X, Liu WG (2026). Investigate the malignant biological effects of the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) in osteosarcoma (OS) and study the underlying mechanisms through mRNA sequencing. CCK-8, colony formation, Transwell assays, live/dead staining, and flow cytometry were used to observe the malignant biological effects of 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PA) on OS cells. mRNA sequencing revealed the mechanism of action of 4-PA on OS cells. Western blotting (WB) was used to detect changes in the expression of histone acetylation, apoptosis, and MAPK-related proteins in OS cells treated with 4-PA. Flow cytometry was used to examine the number of apoptotic OS cells after 4-PA intervention. Animal experiments were conducted to validate the effects of 4-PA on OS cells in vivo. Intervention with 4-PA can significantly inhibit the activity, invasion, migration, and colony-forming abilities of OS cells, while promoting cell death and cell cycle arrest. Results from flow cytometry and apoptosis-related protein detection suggest that 4-PA has the ability to induce apoptosis in OS cells. mRNA sequencing and Western blot analyses showed that 4-PA can inhibit the MAPK/ERK pathway in OS cells. Rescue experiments indicated that the promotion of apoptosis in OS cells by 4-PA may be achieved through the inhibition of the MAPK/ERK pathway. In vivo experiments further confirmed the inhibitory effect of 4-PA on OS growth and its ability to promote apoptosis. The results suggest that HDACi can significantly inhibit the malignant biological abilities of OS cells and induce apoptosis in OS cells by suppressing the MAPK/ERK pathway.",
    "Synthesised database of wild bee and hoverfly records in Europe.. Sentil A, Miličić M, Benrezkallah J, Ačanski J, Andrić A, Aubert M, Bartomeus I, Biella P, Boustani M, Carstensen LB, Bogusch P, Bot S, Brau T, Budrys E, Salazar LC, Cappellari A, Carion F, Castro S, Cavaillès S, Cerretti P, Dathe HH, De Groot M, De Tandt B, Devalez J, Devorsine R, Díaz-Calafat J, Đorđević A, Dormal A, Dufrêne E, Dussaix C, Fedorova Zaytseva LA, Fiordaliso W, Flaminio S, Földesi R, Forgeois V, Gadoum S, Garrin M, Gaspar H, Gazzea E, Geppert C, Gérard M, Geslin B, Ghisbain G, Gibernau M, Grković A, Heimburg H, Herinckx A, Demeter I, Janković Milosavljević M, Janssen K, Kasparek M, Kierat J, Kleijn D, Kuhlmann M, Lair X, Lemaire S, Lenzi L, Likov L, Litman J, Lopes SB, Loureiro J, Maarten J, Maestracci PY, Marini L, Maritano U, Mei M, Mignot M, Stojnić SM, Nedeljković Z, Ockermueller E, Ortiz-Sanchez FJ, Patiny S, Paukkunen J, Pennards G, Perrard A, Petanidou T, Popov G, Popov S, Potts SG, Prokhorov A, Pruner S, Radchenko V, Radenković S, Rasmont P, Reverté S, Ricarte A, Rojo S, Romig T, Rosa P, Ruiz C, Sagot P, Santerre R, Scheper J, Selis M, Sgolastra F, Shparyk V, Siopa C, Skendžic T, Smit J, Sommaggio D, Soon V, Ssymank A, Ståhls G, Stavrinides M, Steffan-Dewenter I, Straka J, Thulier J, Tot T, Tourbez C, van Steenis J, van Steenis W, Varnava A, Veselić S, Vesnic A, Vray S, Williams P, Wood TJ, Zimmermann D, Żmuda A, Vujić A, Michez D, de Manincor N (2026). Wild bees (Hymenoptera: Anthophila) and hoverflies (Diptera: Syrphidae), the two major groups of insect pollinators, are undergoing alarming declines worldwide, including Europe. The lack of accessible and verified spatial and temporal occurrence records currently challenges efforts to understand and mitigate this decline. Here, we compiled datasets from diverse sources, including taxonomists, national experts, public repositories, museum collections, published literature, verified open-access platforms, and aggregated datasets from previous European projects. The collected data were standardised, cleaned and validated by taxonomists and national experts. This collective effort resulted in two databases comprising more than 4.34 million and 1.04 million records for wild bees and hoverflies, respectively. The databases cover 97% of the European bee fauna (2,083 species out of 2,138 recorded in Europe) and 97% of the European hoverfly fauna (886 species out of 913 recorded in Europe). These standardised databases constitute essential resources for future assessments of status and trends, habitat associations, and other research and conservation initiatives to protect and understand wild pollinators on the European continent.",
    "Hand-like autonomous flying robot for airborne grasping and interaction.. Wu Y, Yang F, Jin R, Zhong Y, Wang J, Wu X, Gao F (2026). Birds' extraordinary aerial agility and environmental interaction enable complex tasks such as mid-air hunting, perching, and nest-building, inspiring the development of advanced aerial robots with similar manipulation capabilities. However, existing platforms often face challenges such as large size, heavy payloads, end-effector torque interference, and limited functionality, severely restricting their practical deployment. Drawing inspiration from the biological, structural, and actuation characteristics of human hands, we propose a hand-like robot that integrates flight and grasping, demonstrating the synergistic advantages of compact structure, agile flight, and versatile manipulation. We propose an autonomous framework including efficient mission planning and multi-level adaptive control, enabling the robot to precisely and smoothly perform human-like grasping, opening doors, forest perching, object transport, and interactive tasks. Additionally, the framework supports human-robot collaboration, empowering individuals with mobility impairment to conduct remote transportation and airborne operations. Outdoor tests, which include perching in various scenarios, navigating confined spaces, and transporting payloads across challenging terrain, validate the proposed vehicle's potential in aerial delivery and manipulation tasks. These results demonstrate emerging possibilities for aerial operation, assistance, and delivery with integrated flight and manipulation abilities.",
    "Honokiol blocks tumor development and metastasis through mitochondrion-targeted effects.. Grandi M, Boldrin F, Risato G, Grillini S, Tiso N, Argenton F, Leonardi E, Tosatto S, Solaini G, Baracca A, Giorgio V (2026). IF1 is the natural inhibitor of the mitochondrial ATP synthase during hydrolytic activity. It has been found to be overexpressed in many tumors, where it acts as a pro-oncogenic protein. During oxidative phosphorylation, IF1 binds to a novel site on the OSCP subunit of ATP synthase and promotes tumorigenesis by protecting cancer cells from permeability transition pore (PTP)-dependent apoptosis. In this work, honokiol, a biphenolic compound, showed binding affinity for two sites on the OSCP subunit, as predicted by molecular docking analysis. It was shown to be effective in disrupting the IF1-OSCP interaction and sensitizing cancer cells to apoptosis. In vivo, xenografts of zebrafish injected with IF1-expressing HeLa cells showed tumor development. The same xenografts, treated with honokiol, showed a significant reduction in tumor mass, similar to untreated fish injected with IF1 KO HeLa cells. In vitro, honokiol inhibits colony formation in soft agar of IF1-expressing HeLa cells by promoting the PTP opening and cell death, without any effect on cell proliferation. Interestingly, honokiol was shown to block metastasis in fish xenografts and migration in a wound healing assay, by promoting mitochondrial swelling in both control and IF1 KO cell lines, when cells are moving to close the scratch area. In conclusion, honokiol appears to be a promising anti-cancer compound, with pro-apoptotic properties through the displacement of IF1 from the OSCP subunit of ATP synthase, and anti-metastatic effects that are due to mitochondrial PTP opening.",
    "A radiolabeled dendrimer non-invasively identifies and tracks innate immune cell activation in a mouse model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.. Kuo RC, Carlson ML, Reyes ST, Nagy SC, Kalita M, Alam IS, Malik N, Jackson IM, Acosta CJ, Falk IN, Azevedo EC, Zhang Y, Nichols L, Beinat C, Avci NG, Chattopadhyay M, Minami SS, Cleland JL, James ML (2026). Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease driven by infiltration of activated innate immune cells into the central nervous system (CNS). Current imaging approaches for diagnosing and monitoring disease progression rely on structural lesions and cannot directly assess innate immune activity. Here, we describe a dendrimer positron emission tomography (PET) tracer, 18F-flurimedrimer (18F-FMD), for non-invasive, longitudinal tracking of activated myeloid cells. In an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) murine model, 18F-FMD specifically detects myeloid activation at presymptomatic and symptomatic stages, with PET signal correlating with disease severity. Moreover, 18F-FMD sensitively captures therapeutic response to fingolimod (FTY720) and a CSF1R dendranib (H74DS3M8), both of which suppress immune cell activation and attenuate disease severity. These findings highlight the potential of 18F-FMD PET for specific, real-time monitoring of innate immune responses, and the applicability of the dendrimer in clinical settings for monitoring therapeutic efficacy, advancing the development of personalized, myeloid-targeted strategies for MS.",
    "Precise probiotic therapy: Advances, bottlenecks, and the road to microbiome-informed nutrition.. Jiang Y, Jiang S, Wang Z, Zhu P, Zhang J, Teng F, Huang S (2026). The human gut microbiome is a cornerstone of health, yet conventional probiotic therapies often exhibit limited efficacy owing to heterogeneity in host-microbe-environment dynamics. This review dissects the biological and environmental drivers of such variability and highlights emerging frameworks that integrate cross-sectional and longitudinal multi-omics data to predict probiotic treatment outcomes and host metabolic responses. We further spotlight breakthroughs in methodological development in efficient mining and engineering of probiotic strains, which enable the rational design of functionally enhanced, personalized probiotics. By synthesizing these advances, the review underscores the transformative potential of combining data-driven models with precision-engineered microbial therapeutics to address current limitations and usher in a new era of future microbiome-informed nutrition and personalized interventions.",
    "Splicing Factor SF3B4 Suppresses Pancreatic Cancer Growth and Migration by Inhibiting Autophagy.. Choi SH, Seo J, Jeong SM (2026). BACKGROUND/AIM: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal malignancies, characterized by aggressive progression, profound chemoresistance and unique metabolic adaptations such as elevated autophagy. Although the splicing factor SF3B4 has been reported to function as an oncogene in other malignancies, its role in PDAC remains unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the functional and mechanistic significance of SF3B4 in PDAC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: SF3B4 expression in PDAC was analyzed using patient datasets and experimental models. Functional assays including cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, and autophagy analyses were performed in PDAC cells. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were evaluated. Sensitivity to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and apoptotic responses were also evaluated. RESULTS: SF3B4 acts as a tumor suppressor in PDAC by inhibiting autophagy, a process that this cancer uniquely depends on for survival. SF3B4 overexpression inhibited proliferation, colony formation and migration of PDAC cells. Mechanistically, SF3B4 suppressed autophagic flux, resulting in increased ROS accumulation and subsequent inhibition of tumorigenic phenotypes. Treatment with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) rescued the tumor suppressive effects of SF3B4 overexpression. Moreover, SF3B4 overexpression sensitized PDAC cells to 5-FU, accompanied by enhanced apoptotic responses. CONCLUSION: SF3B4 is a context-dependent splicing factor that functions as a tumor suppressor in PDAC by regulating autophagy and redox homeostasis. Targeting the SF3B4-autophagy-ROS axis may represent a promising strategy to suppress PDAC progression and overcome chemoresistance.",
    "POM121 Drives Gastric Cancer Progression via the mTOR/p70S6K Signaling Axis.. Kim HB, Kim SH, Lee HH, Lee HJ, Park SG (2026). BACKGROUND/AIM: Gastric cancer (GC) remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide. This study aimed to clarify the oncogenic function of POM121 and its involvement in signaling pathways driving tumor progression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: POM121 expression was analyzed in six GC cell lines and one normal gastric epithelial cell line, as well as in clinical datasets. Functional consequences of POM121 knockdown were assessed in AGS and KATO-III cells using cell proliferation, migration, soft agar colony formation, proteomic profiling, and in vivo xenograft models. Phosphorylation of p70S6 kinase at Thr389 and Thr421/Ser424 was examined to determine downstream signaling. RESULTS: POM121 was consistently found to be upregulated in GC tissues and cell lines. Silencing of POM121 significantly inhibited proliferation, migration, anchorage-independent growth, and tumorigenicity in vivo. Proteomic analysis revealed that suppression of POM121 attenuated phosphorylation of p70S6K at Thr389 and Thr421/Ser424, indicating impaired mTOR-p70S6K signaling. CONCLUSION: POM121 promotes GC progression by enhancing proliferative and invasive phenotypes through p70S6 kinase-mediated signaling. These findings establish POM121 as a novel oncogene, prognostic biomarker, and potential therapeutic target in GC.",
    "Oncogenic Role and Clinical Significance of NPM1 in Colorectal Cancer via the AKT/mTOR Signaling Pathway.. Kim HB, Lee HJ, Park SG (2026). BACKGROUND/AIM: Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a major global health challenge with poor survival in advanced disease. Identifying new oncogenic drivers is essential for improving diagnosis and therapy. This study investigated the oncogenic role of nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) in CRC and its involvement in the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. MATERIALS AND METHODS: TCGA-COAD datasets were analyzed to compare NPM1 expression in tumor and normal tissues. Functional assays (MTT proliferation, soft agar colony formation, migration, and in vivo xenograft models) were performed after siRNA-mediated NPM1 knockdown in HCT-116 and DLD-1 cells. Western blotting and phospho-kinase arrays were used to evaluate phosphorylation of AKT, mTOR, and p70 S6 kinase. RESULTS: NPM1 expression was significantly upregulated in CRC tissues. Knockdown of NPM1 suppressed proliferation, migration, anchorage-independent growth, and in vivo tumorigenicity. Mechanistically, NPM1 depletion reduced phosphorylation of AKT, mTOR, and p70 S6 kinase, while total protein levels were unchanged. Downstream oncogenic regulators, including MYC and AP-1 components (c-Jun and c-FOS), were also decreased. CONCLUSION: NPM1 acts as an oncogenic driver in colorectal cancer by activating the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Elevated NPM1 expression highlights its potential as a diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic biomarker in CRC.",
    "Tumor-derived ITIH2 activates PI3K\\AKT pathway via THBS1 ubiquitination and promotes tumor angiogenesis in hepatocellular carcinoma.. Liu Z, Yuan J, Zeng Q, Wu Z, Yang J, Lv T (2026). The heterogeneous tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a critical role in the initiation and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Within the TME, tumor vascular endothelial cells (ECs) are key stromal components that drive angiogenesis. However, the molecular mechanisms of interaction relationships between angiogenesis and tumor progression in HCC remain unclear. We performed clustering analysis on scRNA-seq data from two HCC patients (GSE166635) and identified eight distinct cell types using uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP). An eight-gene risk signature was established to predict patient prognosis. Using iterative least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and multivariate Cox regression, we developed a risk scoring system and constructed a clinically applicable nomogram with TCGA HCC dataset as training cohort and ICGC HCC dataset as validation cohort. The predictive performance of the model was assessed and validated through calibration and decision curve analysis (DCA). Furthermore, we identified ITIH2 as a novel prognostic biomarker in HCC that may be associated with angiogenesis. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of clinical samples verified the prognostic value of ITIH2, which was also correlated with the levels of angiogenesis biomarkers, CD31 and CD34. Interestingly, functional experiments, including colony formation, CCK-8, and flow cytometry assays, revealed that ITIH2 overexpression did not alter tumor cell proliferation or apoptosis. Instead, ITIH2 enhanced the angiogenic capacity of ECs and promoted tumor progression in both in vitro and in vivo experiments. However, overexpression of THBS1 could reverse the function of ITIH2 on ECs and PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Mechanistically, tumor-derived ITIH2 was associated with activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in ECs via a ubiquitination-dependent regulation of THBS1. The findings recapitulated that tumor-derived ITIH2 could promote HCC progression by enhancing the angiogenic ability of ECs by activating PI3K/AKT signaling pathway via THBS1 stability mediated by ubiquitination.",
    "Inhibiting H3K18 lactylation in microglia aggravates white matter injury after intracerebral hemorrhage in mice.. Jiang B, Li L, Yuan Y, Zhang Z, Xie Y, Zhang L, Tao Y, Xie Z (2026). BACKGROUND: White matter injury (WMI) is a key contributor to long-term cognitive deficits following intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), yet its underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. AIMS: This study aims to investigate the role of histone H3K18 lactylation (H3K18la) and microglial function in post-ICH WMI and cognitive impairment. METHODS: Utilizing a collagenase-induced ICH mouse model, we assessed H3K18la expression dynamics (days 3, 7, 14, 21 post-ICH) and the effects of inhibiting lactate dehydrogenase (using Oxamate) or p300/CBP histone acetyltransferase (using A-485) on WMI and cognitive function. Furthermore, we employed PLX5622 (a colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor inhibitor) to deplete microglia (MG), alone or combined with A-485, to examine the role of p300/CBP inhibition in the context of MG absence. WMI was evaluated using myelin basic protein (MBP), neurofilament H (non-phosphorylated; SMI32) immunostaining, and transmission electron microscopy. Oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) accumulation around the hematoma was quantified, and microglial depletion was verified by cell counting. Cognitive function was assessed up to 28 days post-ICH using the Morris Water Maze test. RESULTS: H3K18la levels were elevated and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) increased in the perihematomal region post-ICH. A-485 administration significantly reduced microglial H3K18la, concomitantly suppressed OPC recruitment to the injury site, and exacerbated both WMI and long-term cognitive impairment. In contrast, oxamate administration did not significantly reduce microglial H3K18la or exacerbate cognitive deficits, but it did significantly aggravate WMI. PLX5622-induced MG depletion similarly aggravated WMI and cognitive deficits. However, combined PLX5622 and A-485 treatment did not produce additive worsening compared to MG depletion alone. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrated that lactate-derived H3K18 lactylation (H3K18la), orchestrated by p300/CBP-mediated epigenetic reprogramming, serves as a critical endogenous neuroprotective axis of WMI following ICH. Microglia emerge as the cellular executors of this pathway. This lactate-p300/CBP-H3K18la axis thus represents a therapeutically targetable mechanism for enhancing post-hemorrhagic brain repair through microglia-guided myelin regeneration.",
    "Co-delivery of human adipose-derived stromal cells and endothelial colony-forming cells in cell-assembled decellularized adipose tissue scaffolds for applications in soft tissue regeneration.. From SA, Walker JT, Gillis CJ, Ronald JA, Hess DA, Flynn LE (2026). Cellular therapies involving the co-delivery of cells with complementary pro-regenerative functionality hold promise as a strategy to promote soft tissue augmentation and regeneration. In particular, the co-delivery of adipose-derived stromal cells (ASCs) and endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) has shown promise for regenerating stable blood vessels in vivo. The current study developed \"cell-assembled\" scaffolds for co-delivering human ASCs and ECFCs within a supportive decellularized adipose tissue (DAT) matrix, with the objective of enhancing their localized retention and augmenting their capacity to stimulate adipose tissue regeneration. Human ASCs and ECFCs were seeded separately onto human-derived DAT microcarriers under cell-type specific conditions. The cell-seeded microcarriers were then combined and cultured for 8 days under conditions that promoted matrix remodeling to fuse the microcarriers into 3D engineered tissues containing ASCs+ECFCs, ASCs alone, or ECFCs alone. Co-culture with ECFCs within the scaffolds was shown to modulate ASC pro-angiogenic gene expression, with some ECFCs forming tubule-like structures in vitro in both the ASC+ECFC and ECFC alone groups. In vivo bioluminescence imaging using a dual luciferase reporter system showed that co-delivery with ASCs enhanced ECFC retention following subcutaneous implantation in athymic nu/nu mice, but co-delivery did not alter the localized retention of viable ASCs. Interestingly, while immunofluorescence staining for CD31 and microcomputed tomography angiography indicated that vascular regeneration was similar in the cell-assembled scaffolds containing ASC+ECFCs, ASCs alone, and ECFCs alone, histological staining revealed that extensive regions of the ECFC alone scaffolds had remodelled into adipose tissue at 29 days post-implantation. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Cellular therapies involving the co-delivery of complementary pro-regenerative cell types hold promise as a strategy to promote soft tissue regeneration. In particular, the co-delivery of adipose-derived stromal cells (ASCs) and endothelial colony forming cells (ECFCs) may enhance blood vessel regeneration in vivo, as well as promote ASC engraftment and adipogenic differentiation. The current study developed a modular bottom-up fabrication approach for generating \"cell-assembled\" scaffolds incorporating both human ASCs and ECFCs dispersed throughout a supportive human decellularized adipose tissue (DAT) matrix, which were compared to scaffolds incorporating ASCs alone or ECFCs alone. Co-delivery modulated ASC pro-angiogenic gene expression in vitro and enhanced viable ECFC retention in vivo, but interestingly, in vivo adipogenesis was augmented in the cell-assembled scaffolds incorporating ECFCs alone.",
    "Comparing mesenchymal stem/stromal cells from dermis discarded in elective surgeries: Identifying optimal sources for regenerative medicine.. Zomer HD, Fagundes AC, Ferreira LA, Asciutti ACS, Barros-Delben P, da Silva MM, Mitze J, da Silva Jeremias T, Trentin AG (2026). The dermis is a valuable and accessible source of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs), particularly for applications in skin wound healing. Dermal MSCs (DSCs) can be isolated from skin fragments typically discarded during routine elective surgeries, such as facelifts (rhytidectomies), tummy tucks (abdominoplasties), and circumcisions (postectomies). While MSCs generally share core stem cell properties, their behavior may be influenced by factors such as donor age, sex, and the anatomical tissue origin. Understanding the specific characteristics of DSCs from different sources is therefore crucial for identifying the most suitable cells for clinical use. In this study, we compared human DSCs obtained from rhytidectomies (postmenopausal facial dermis), abdominoplasties (adult abdominal dermis), and postectomies (prepubertal foreskin dermis) by assessing their isolation efficiency, stemness markers, proliferative capacity, and in vitro wound healing. All three DSC populations exhibited comparable stemness profiles; however, DSCs from prepubertal foreskin demonstrated superior isolation yield, expansion potential, and colony-forming efficiency, likely reflecting the younger age of the tissue donors. Despite these differences, DSCs from both prepubertal foreskin and adult abdominal skin exhibited similar wound healing performance in vitro. In conclusion, our findings indicate that the source of dermal tissue significantly influences DSC behavior in vitro, with cells derived from postectomies and abdominoplasties showing enhanced potential compared to those from rhytidectomies.",
    "RNF6 activates JNK/c-JUN pathway in ovarian cancer by promoting K48-linked NME4 ubiquitination.. Li T, Qian F, Chen Y, Li W (2026). BACKGROUND: RING finger protein 6 (RNF6), a member of the E3 ubiquitin ligase family, has been implicated in various cancers, yet its functional significance and regulatory mechanisms in ovarian cancer (OC) are poorly understood. METHODS: RNF6 expression levels were analyzed using TCGA data and confirmed by IHC, qRT-PCR, and western blotting in OC tissues or cell lines. Functional roles of RNF6 were evaluated through CCK-8, colony formation, wound healing, Transwell, and EMT marker assays. Protein interactions and ubiquitination patterns were investigated via Co-IP, CHX chase, and ubiquitination assays. Rescue experiments were conducted by co-modulating RNF6 and NME4 expression. In vivo tumorigenesis was assessed using a nude mouse xenograft model. RESULTS: RNF6 was markedly overexpressed in OC and associated with poor prognosis. Silencing RNF6 suppressed cell growth, invasive behavior, and EMT, while enhancing NME4 expression. Mechanistic analyses demonstrated that RNF6 directly binds to NME4 and facilitates its K48-linked polyubiquitination, leading to proteasomal degradation. Knockdown of NME4 reversed the tumor-suppressive effects of RNF6 depletion and reinstated JNK/c-JUN pathway activation. In vivo, RNF6 silencing significantly reduced tumor burden and impaired downstream signaling events. CONCLUSION: RNF6 contributed to OC malignancy by destabilizing NME4 and activating the JNK cascade. This newly identified RNF6/NME4/JNK axis provides potential targets for therapeutic intervention in OC.",
    "DLST mediates the malignant progression of osteosarcoma cells by regulating the p38 MAPK signaling pathway.. Guo C, Liao K, Xu K, Zhang J, Chen G, Luo X, Yang J, Dai Z, Lv XB, Zhang F, Zhang Z (2026). BACKGROUND: This research investigates the function of dihydrolipoic acid succinyltransferase (DLST) in the initiation and progression of osteosarcoma. METHODS: Cellular functions were assessed using CCK-8, colony formation, scratch assays, transwell assays, and flow cytometry. The expression of relevant genes at both mRNA and protein levels was detected using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting techniques. The regulatory mechanism of DLST was analyzed through RNA-sequencing. Finally, tumor growth in vivo was evaluated using established animal models. RESULTS: DLST was highly expressed in osteosarcoma. Knockdown of DLST limited the proliferative, migratory, invasive, and anti-apoptotic abilities of osteosarcoma cells. RNA-seq was employed to analyze its mechanism, which showed that DLST can influence the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. Functional validation further showed that the p38 MAPK signaling pathway inhibitor was able to reverse the malignant functional changes in osteosarcoma cells that had been caused by DLST knockdown. Finally, in in vivo experiments, knocking down the DLST gene in the osteosarcoma animal model slowed down tumor growth. CONCLUSION: In this study, we found that DLST promotes the proliferation, migration, invasion, anti-apoptosis of osteosarcoma cells, as well as tumor growth, regulated through the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. These results could offer novel and valuable perspectives for the clinical management of osteosarcoma.",
    "Multimodal social context modulates larval behavior in Drosophila.. Mudunuri A, Zadigue-Dubé É, Vogt K (2026). All animals need to navigate and make decisions in social environments. They influence each other's behavior, but how important this is and how they process and represent social information in their brain are less well understood. This includes fruit flies and larvae, usually not known as \"social insects.\" Using a Drosophila larva assay with reduced stimulation, we found that groups show enhanced dispersal and distance from each other in the absence of food. This social context-dependent modulation overrides responses to many external sensory cues and is shaped by developmental social experience. Leveraging the genetic toolbox available in Drosophila, we find that different sensory modalities are required for social context modulation. Our results show that even less social animals such as fly larvae are affected by conspecifics and recognize each other through multimodal sensory cues. This study provides a tractable system for future dissection of the neural circuit mechanisms underlying social interactions.",
    "Pharmacological STING Activation Enhances Autophagy-Mediated Clearance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Human Macrophages.. Niu F, Zhong R, Pu F, Dai X, Wang J, Feng J, Xia P (2026). OBJECTIVE: The cGAS-STING pathway is a critical sensor in the innate immune response to intracellular pathogens, yet its therapeutic potential for augmenting macrophage-mediated control of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) remains incompletely understood. This study investigated whether pharmacological activation of the STING pathway could enhance autophagy to promote Mtb clearance in human macrophages. METHODS: Human THP-1 monocytes were differentiated into macrophages and infected with Mtb. The effects of the STING agonist MIW815 (ADU-S100) on Mtb phagocytosis, intracellular bacterial survival, and autophagic flux were assessed using a combination of molecular and cellular techniques, including qRT-PCR, western blotting, colony-forming unit (CFU) assays, and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. The dependency on the cGAS-STING pathway was confirmed using siRNA-mediated gene silencing. RESULTS: Pharmacological activation of STING with ADU-S100 significantly enhanced Mtb phagocytosis and subsequent intracellular clearance. This enhanced bactericidal activity was mechanistically linked to an increase in autophagic flux, as evidenced by elevated LC3-II protein levels and significantly increased colocalization of Mtb with lysosomal compartments. Importantly, treatment with the autophagy inhibitor hydroxychloroquine or silencing of cGAS significantly reversed these phenotypes, confirming the pivotal role of the STING-autophagy axis. CONCLUSION: Activating the STING pathway with ADU-S100 is a potent host-directed strategy to bolster macrophage autophagy and enhance the elimination of intracellular Mtb. This provides a strong rationale for exploring STING agonists as a novel therapeutic intervention for tuberculosis, addressing a significant and clinically relevant challenge in infectious disease.",
    "Prebiotic Properties of Structurally Diverse Plant Polysaccharides.. Kharina MV, Mikhailova AA, Mikshina PV (2025). This study is aimed to evaluate the prebiotic potential of plant polysaccharides of various structural types and origins, including acacia gum arabinogalactan, beech wood xylan, apple pectin enriched in homogalacturonan, flaxseed mucilage (containing arabinoxylan, and rhamnogalacturonan I), and chicory inulin. All carbohydrate samples varied in their monosaccharide composition and molecular weight distribution. The prebiotic activity of the polysaccharides was assessed using in vitro models under anaerobic conditions with the Bifidobacterium bifidum 791 and Lactobacillus acidophilus n.v. Ep 317/402. It was found that adding various polysaccharides to the nutrient media intensified lactic acid production, increased the biomass yield of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, and influenced the rate and extent of substrate assimilation. The lower molecular weight inulin (4.2 kDa) and arabinogalactan (115 kDa) supported higher biomass yields in both strains. The viable cell count of Bifidobacterium bifidum 791 (colony-forming units per mL) increased by 3.5, 12.3, 110.5, 128.1, and 215.8% compared to the control upon the addition of beech wood xylan, flaxseed mucilage polysaccharides, apple pectin, inulin, and acacia arabinogalactan, respectively. For L. acidophilus n.v. Ep 317/402, the addition of the same polysaccharides increased the biomass yield by 1.5, 7.7, 64.6, 69.2, and 207.7%, respectively, versus the control. Flaxseed mucilage, composed of rhamnogalacturonan I (3400 kDa) and arabinoxylan (1330 kDa), supported a high biomass yield in both cultures. Based on this research, it can be concluded that flaxseed mucilage promoted probiotic growth in a manner similar to, and often more effectively than, the established prebiotic inulin. Due to the availability of flaxseeds, simple mucilage extraction process, and the limited existing research, flaxseed polysaccharide complex emerges as a promising candidate for further development as a prebiotic supplement.",
    "SUMOylation machinery protein, PIAS4 role in breast cancer cell proliferation and drug sensitivity.. Salih MAM, Salem MMAEL, Shahid MA, Elrewey HAS, Williamson R, Kantamneni S (2026). PURPOSE: Breast cancer is a significant global health issue, with resistance to doxorubicin (DOX) posing a major challenge to effective treatment. SUMOylation, a post-translational modification process, is linked to cancer progression and therapy resistance. PIAS4, a SUMO E3 ligase involved in maintaining genome stability and stress response, may play a role in these mechanisms. However, its function in breast cancer progression and DOX resistance remains uncertain. This study investigates the potential role of PIAS4 in mediating DOX resistance in breast cancer. METHODS AND RESULTS: Naked mole-rats (NMRs) are cancer-resistant rodents with improved genome maintenance, yet the role of SUMOylation in this trait remains unclear. SUMOylation machinery gene expression levels are investigated using qPCR in NMR tissue in comparison with carcinogenic breast cancer (MCF-7) cell line. Functional studies are performed in MCF-7 cells overexpressing PIAS4 to demonstrate effects on proliferation, invasion, drug sensitivity, and protein expression in the presence and absence of DOX treatment. While most SUMOylation genes were expressed at low levels in NMR intestinal tissues, PIAS4 showed higher expression compared to MCF-7 cells. PIAS4 overexpression in MCF-7 cells significantly decreases colony formation, invasiveness, and resistance to DOX. Western blot analysis showed downregulated Bcl-2 protein levels after DOX treatment, indicating a potential role in apoptosis evasion. CONCLUSION: PIAS4 expression level plays a role in breast cancer cell survival, invasiveness, and chemoresistance, partly by altering anti-apoptotic pathways. These findings position PIAS4 as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for overcoming resistance to anthracycline-based therapies in breast cancer.",
    "Experimental evidence for the absence of a functional gut microbiome in the solitary bee Megachile tosticauda.. Williamson E, Hill K, Eisenhofer R, Hogendoorn K (2026). The eusocial honey bee is a model for insect microbiome research, with socially transmitted gut communities that play key roles in health and development. In contrast, solitary bees lack social transmission pathways and often have an environmentally acquired microbiome, which may or may not be functionally important. Using 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding, previous work has described the bacterial communities in the solitary resin bee Megachile tosticauda pollen provisions, brood, and adult bees, but their functional significance has yet to be studied. Here, we investigate the importance of live bacteria for larval development and survival with an antibiotic-feeding experiment, and test whether bacteria are present in adult guts using scanning electron microscopy. Removing live bacteria in the food and gut of feeding larvae had no significant effect on survival or growth. Microscopy revealed no bacterial colonization of the adult gut, and the dominant taxon detected in larval pollen could not be cultured under targeted conditions. These results suggest an absence of a beneficial gut microbiome in M. tosticauda. Based on our findings, we propose that some bacteria detected by DNA-based methods in M. tosticauda may represent relic DNA, surface-associated or transient bacteria. Our findings highlight fundamental differences in the bacterial associations between social and solitary bees.",
    "Role of the Super-Enhancer Component Bromodomain Protein 4 in the Radiation Response of Human Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma Cells.. Munakata N, Yoshino H, Hazawa M, Tsuruga E (2026). Radiotherapy is an effective treatment for cancer; however, radioresistant cancer cells result in recurrence. Therefore, elucidating the mechanisms of radioresistance is urgently needed. Super-enhancers (SEs) are clusters of enhancers occupied by a high density of master transcription factors, mediators, and bromodomain protein BRD4. Recently, we reported that ΔNp63, an oncogenic transcription factor, promotes radioresistance in human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells. As ΔNp63 establishes SEs in HNSCC cells, SEs may be involved in radioresistance. Here, we investigated the role of the SE component BRD4 in the radiation responses of HNSCC cells using a BRD4 degrader ARV-771 or BRD4 knockdown. First, Western blotting confirmed that ARV-771 decreased BRD4 protein expression. ARV-771 treatment resulted in reduced cell proliferation and enhanced apoptosis in irradiated HNSCC cells. Moreover, colony formation assays revealed that both ARV-771 and BRD4 knockdown enhanced the radiosensitivity of HNSCC cells, suggesting BRD4 contributes to the radioresistance of HNSCC cells. Furthermore, fluorescence immunostaining revealed distinct localization patterns of γH2AX, a marker of DNA double-strand breaks, compared with BRD4 and ΔNp63 in irradiated cells. Notably, ARV-771 and BRD4 knockdown decreased ΔNp63 and BRD4 protein expression, whereas ΔNp63 knockdown had minimal impact on BRD4 expression. Taken together, these findings suggest that BRD4-dependent maintenance of ΔNp63 expression may contribute, at least in part, to the regulation of radioresistance in HNSCC cells.",
    "Synergistic Anticancer Effects of Fermented Noni Extract Combined with 5-Fluorouracil, Doxorubicin, and Vincristine on A549, MCF-7, and SH-SY5Y Cell Models.. Lim JS, Im JH, Fu X, Kim MH, Seong YS, Lee JY, Park EY, Lee DS, La IJ, Lee OH (2025). Although chemotherapy is a primary approach for cancer treatment, its efficacy is often compromised by the development of drug resistance and occurrence of serious side effects. To improve chemotherapy outcomes, this study aimed to evaluate the synergistic anticancer effects of fermented noni extract (FN) in combination with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), doxorubicin (DOX), or vincristine (VIN) in A549, MCF-7, and SH-SY5Y cancer cell lines. Cells were treated with FN, anticancer drugs, or their combinations. Cell viability was assessed using XTT assays, and synergism was evaluated by calculating combination index (CI) values. Scratch wound and colony formation assays were conducted to assess cell migration and proliferation. Western blotting was used to analyze the expression of apoptosis-related proteins. Combination treatments significantly enhanced cytotoxicity (CI < 1), inhibited migration and colony formation, and induced intrinsic apoptosis. Expression ratios of BAX/BCL-2, cleaved caspase-9/caspase-9, and cleaved caspase-3/caspase-3 notably increased. These findings suggest that FN enhances the efficacy of chemotherapy drugs by promoting intrinsic apoptotic pathways and may serve as a potential natural adjuvant in cancer therapy.",
    "Developing an Italian Adaptation of the Interpersonal Sensitivities Circumplex (ISC-IT) Using Ant Colony Optimization.. Di Sarno M, Wendt LP, Di Pierro R, Hopwood CJ, Müller S (2026). The Interpersonal Sensitivities Circumplex (ISC) measures individual differences in the sensitivity to interpersonal behaviors, organized along the dimensions of agency (e.g., sensitivity to others' assertive behavior) and communion (e.g., sensitivity to others' warm behavior). The present study aimed at validating a 40-item Italian adaptation of the ISC using methods that advance previous approaches to developing circumplex measures. Specifically, we (a) applied ant colony optimization, a well-performing technique to identify optimal items, (b) employed an item-level circumplex model to avoid limitations associated with item parceling, and (c) evaluated model fit using the dynamic fit index, which allows for a more rigorous assessment of theoretical structure. In two samples of the Italian general population (N = 401 and N = 301), the ISC-IT demonstrated sound psychometric properties, including acceptable model fit and internal consistency, and plausible associations with external variables. Using the ISC-IT, we replicated key findings from previous research, including that individuals are most sensitive to interpersonal behaviors that are opposite to their own, and that interpersonal sensitivities have both general and specific associations with maladaptive personality traits. This work contributes to the theoretical literature on interpersonal sensitivities and showcases contemporary test construction and validation techniques in developing circumplex measures.",
    "Conformational Dynamics and Catalytic Backups in a Hyper-thermostable Engineered Archaeal Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase.. Yehorova D, Alansson N, Shen R, Denson JM, Robinson M, Risso VA, Ramirez Molina N, Loria JP, Gaucher EA, Sanchez-Ruiz JM, Hengge AC, Johnson SJ, Kamerlin SCL (2026). Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) are a family of enzymes that play important roles in regulating cellular signaling pathways. The activity of these enzymes is regulated by the motion of a catalytic loop that places a critical conserved aspartic acid side chain into the active site for acid-base catalysis upon loop closure. These enzymes also have a conserved phosphate-binding loop that is typically highly rigid and forms a well-defined anion-binding nest. The intimate links between loop dynamics and chemistry in these enzymes make PTPs an excellent model system for understanding the role of loop dynamics in protein function and evolution. In this context, archaeal PTPs, which have often evolved in extremophilic organisms, are highly understudied, despite their unusual biophysical properties. We present here an engineered chimeric PTP (ShufPTP) generated by shuffling the amino acid sequence of five extant hyperthermophilic archaeal PTPs. Despite ShufPTP's high sequence similarity to its natural counterparts, it presents a suite of unique properties, including high flexibility of the phosphate binding P-loop, facile oxidation of the active-site cysteine, mechanistic promiscuity, and, most notably, hyperthermostability, with a denaturation temperature likely >130 °C (>8 °C higher than the highest recorded growth temperature of any archaeal strain). Our combined structural, biochemical, biophysical, and computational analysis provides insight both into how small steps in evolutionary space can radically modulate the biophysical properties of an enzyme and showcases the tremendous potential of archaeal enzymes for biotechnology, to generate novel enzymes capable of operating under extreme conditions.",
    "Microbial Cross-Talk: Unlocking the Cytochalasin Diversity from a Termite-Associated Xylaria.. Dayras M, Liu Y, Kochems R, de Kruijff M, Balluff S, Rasheed S, Kany AM, Herrmann J, Götze S, Morgenstern B, Koné NA, Poulsen M, Müller R, Beemelmanns C (2026). Integrating organismal interaction studies with advanced genomic and metabolomic approaches offer great promise for discovering novel natural products and their derivatives, yet this strategy remains relatively unexplored. Here, we illustrate its potential by investigating a newly isolated Xylaria strain from a termite colony environment through combined genome and metabolome analyses, complemented by fungal-bacterial coculture experiments. Genome sequencing of the fungal strain allowed us to pinpoint a cytochalasin-related biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for the production of a portfolio of different bioactive epoxy-cytochalasins. Guided by the hypothesis of biosynthetic promiscuity of the underlying nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), we demonstrated for the first time that the NRPS can accept unnatural ortho- and meta-halogenated phenylalanine derivatives, leading to the isolation of multiple new chlorinated and brominated cytochalasin analogs. Second, based on the hypothesis that structural diversification can arise from interactions with commensal organisms, cocultivation with a termite-associated Streptomyces strain led to the discovery of a previously undescribed aspartic acid-containing cytochalasan derivative, designated xylachalasin A. Isotope labeling experiments revealed that bacterial catabolic activity is responsible for the modification of the fungal-derived cytochalasin. Isolated cytochalasins were also amiable for semisynthesis modifications, which was exemplified by the synthesis of bifunctional probes. Bioassays of a total of 26 isolated and semisynthesized derivatives demonstrated structure-dependent cytotoxicity in some cases with up to 3-fold log differences in potency and generally good plasma stability. Overall, our integrated approach underscores the vast potential of investigating fungal strains from underexplored ecological niches and their organismal interactions, offering new opportunities to discover novel natural products of potential therapeutic relevance and previously unrecognized biochemical processes.",
    "Deep-Sea Genome Mining Reveals Cooperative ATP-Grasp Ligase-Directed Biosynthesis of Pentacyclic Myxomiditides with Potent Protease Inhibition.. Li Y, Wang J, Zhang Z, Zhang Y, Müller R, Huo L (2026). Microviridins are ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides, typically featuring a conserved tricyclic structure formed by two ATP-grasp ligases. However, the diversity and evolution of these enzymes remain incompletely understood. Here, we identify a distinct ATP-grasp ligase subclade (MyxF) that specifically modifies the conserved (KxxE)n motif, defining a new subclass of microviridins with the (KxxE)nTxKxPSDx-(D/E)-(D/E) sequence signature. Guided by SSN analysis, we discovered a deep-sea myx biosynthetic gene cluster from 10,000 m sediments and heterologously expressed two pentacyclic microviridin-like peptides, Myxomiditide A and B. Using mass spectrometry and NMR, we fully elucidated their chemical structures, revealing not only the conserved tricyclic core but also two additional N-terminal lactam rings within the KxxEKxxE motif, distinguishing them from known microviridins. Combined in vivo coexpression and in vitro reconstitution uncovered a noncanonical division of labor among four ATP-grasp ligases involved in myxomiditide biosynthesis. MyxF and MyxD1 act as functional isozymes responsible for installation of the N-terminal lactam moieties, whereas MyxD2catalytically inactive on its ownrequires the synergistic presence of both MyxF and MyxD1 to enable formation of the C-terminal lactone rings. The pathway is finalized by MyxC, which catalyzes the terminal lactam macrocyclization, collectively revealing a highly cooperative enzymatic assembly mechanism governing myxomiditide maturation. Furthermore, MyxF exhibited remarkable catalytic plasticity, catalyzing multiple lactam macrocyclizations beyond its native substrate architecture. Notably, Myxomiditide A potently inhibited elastase with nanomolar IC50 values. Collectively, this study expands the enzymatic landscape of ATP-grasp ligases and highlights the deep sea as a rich source of evolutionary innovation in RiPP biosynthesis.",
    "Unmasking Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus argenteus: pathogenic potential, diagnostic pitfalls and antibiotic resistance of MRSArg in Norway 2008-2019.. Rønning TG, Enger H, Zaragkoulias K, Ås CG (2025). BACKGROUND: Staphylococcus argenteus is a coagulase-positive species within the Staphylococcus aureus complex that may carry the mecA gene, conferring methicillin resistance. Despite its clinical relevance, methicillin-resistant S. argenteus (MRSArg) remains underreported and poorly characterized in many regions. AIM: This study presents the first nationwide analysis of MRSArg in Norway, detected among MRSA 18,152 isolates submitted to the Norwegian MRSA Reference Laboratory between 2008 and 2019. METHODS: Clinical and epidemiological data were retrieved from national surveillance systems and laboratory records, enabling classification into healthcare- and community-associated categories. A representative panel of MRSArg genotypes (n = 25) was inoculated onto four MRSA-selective chromogenic agars for qualitative assessment of growth characteristics and colony pigmentation, and into two enrichment broths for quantitative evaluation of stationary-phase cell density. Identification was performed using MALDI-ToF MS and GeneXpert assays. Whole genome sequencing of 160 isolates enabled phylogenetic analysis, resistance and virulence profiling, and cgMLST. A species-specific multiplex PCR targeting yhfT, mecA, and lukE, along with adapted spa-typing primers, was developed for accurate molecular identification and typing. RESULTS: A total of 160 mecA-positive MRSArg strains (0.9%) were identified, corresponding to 142 unique patients. Most cases were community-associated and linked to international acquisition, particularly from Southeast Asia. However, 36% were healthcare-associated, including a notable proportion among healthcare workers. The dominant genotype was spa-type t6675/ST2250 (50%), with increasing diversity observed after 2014. A species-specific multiplex-PCR and sanger sequencing primers for detection and genotyping of MRSArg were developed and validated. CONCLUSION: MRSArg is an emerging pathogen in Norway with both community and healthcare relevance. Improved molecular diagnostics are essential for accurate detection and surveillance.",
    "Network pharmacology, bioinformatics and in vitro/in vivo validation elucidate the anti-lung cancer activities and potential targets of Rhoifolin.. Qian J, Cheng W, Li S, Deng L, Gao D, Zhang X, Zhang Y (2025). BACKGROUND: Rhoifolin (ROF), a naturally occurring flavonoid, exhibits broad bioactivities, but its therapeutic potential and underlying mechanisms in lung cancer remain largely unknown. This study was designed to systematically investigate the anti-tumor effects of ROF and identify its key molecular targets. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Anti-tumor activities of ROF were assessed using CCK-8, colony formation, flow cytometry, wound healing, and Transwell assays, respectively. An integrated approach combining network pharmacology, transcriptomic analysis with machine learning was employed to identify primary targets. The Kaplan-Meier survival and ROC curve analyses also evaluated the targets' clinical outcomes and tumor microenvironment through the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data and single-cell RNA sequencing. The confirmed experimentally via RT-qPCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence. The drug-target interaction was characterized by molecular docking and dynamics simulations. Finally, the in vivo antitumor efficacy and the safety of ROF were assessed in an H358 xenograft mouse model. RESULTS: ROF potently inhibited lung cancer cell proliferation (IC50: 15.35-33.84 µM), migration, and invasion, while inducing G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis (increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio). ROF also impaired metastatic potential as evidenced by upregulated E-cadherin and downregulated N-cadherin in vitro. EPHB2 was identified as the most therapeutically relevant, showing high diagnostic value (AUC=0.856) and a significant correlation with poor patient survival. The experimental validation confirmed that ROF downregulates EPHB2 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels in a dose-dependent manner. Molecular docking and dynamics simulations predicted a stable, high-affinity interaction between ROF and the EPHB2 protein. Importantly, ROF treatment significantly suppressed tumor growth in vivo without discernible toxicity. CONCLUSION: Rhoifolin exerts potent and selective anti-lung cancer activity by directly targeting and downregulating EPHB2, providing a strong rationale for its further development as a novel therapeutic agent for lung cancer.",
    "Collective self-assessment in banded mongoose intergroup contests.. Rayner CW, Green PA, Hunt KL, Thompson FJ, Mwanguhya F, Cant MA, Sankey DWE (2026). Contests over resources are widespread in nature. To optimize outcomes, animals assess fighting abilities, deciding to escalate conflicts based on their own strength (self-assessment) or comparing their own strength with that of their rival (mutual assessment). While most research focuses on one-on-one (dyadic) contests, the assessment strategies employed by groups remain poorly understood, even though animal groups from ants to humans engage in intergroup conflict. Mutual assessment is frequently assumed, as more information is thought to improve decision-making; however, this assumption has rarely been tested. Here we used a dataset spanning 21 years and 633 intergroup contests in a banded mongoose (Mungos mungo) population in Queen Elizabeth National Park, Uganda. Our results support a model of self-assessment: groups with many males tend to escalate conflicts regardless of the rival group's strength, thus contrasting the commonly held assumption that decisions during intergroup contests are made by mutual assessment. We suggest that assessing rival group strength during conflict could be disproportionately costly, compared with assessing own group strength, which can be done over longer time periods and is easier to obtain. Greater understanding of these dynamics can shed light on the drivers and escalation patterns of intergroup conflict across social species, including humans.",
    "Utilization of a UPLC-MS/MS Approach to Elucidate the Role of ABCB1-Mediated Paclitaxel Resistance in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Cells.. Hu S, Wang W, Hu Q, Zheng R, Huang Q, Shi H, Ding X, Wang W, Zhu Z (2026). OBJECTIVES: Acquired resistance to paclitaxel represents a critical barrier to the effective chemotherapy of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The present study aimed to elucidate the molecular and pharmacological mechanisms promoting paclitaxel resistance in NSCLC and to explore potential strategies for overcoming this resistance. METHODS: Here, we report an integrated pharmacological and analytical approach to quantify paclitaxel disposition and overcome resistance in a A549/TAX cell model (paclitaxel-resistant A549 cells). RESULTS: Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, colony formation, and apoptosis assays confirmed that A549/TAX cells exhibited marked resistance to paclitaxel relative to parental A549 cells. Based on transcriptome profiling by RNA sequencing analysis and validation by western blotting assay, we found that the expression of the ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1) (the encoded protein is termed P-glycoprotein) was significantly upregulated in resistant cells. By using ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS), we demonstrated that ABCB1 overexpression promotes enhanced efflux of intracellular paclitaxel, thereby lowering its cytotoxic accumulation. Genetic silencing of ABCB1 or pharmacological inhibition with the specific P-glycoprotein modulator elacridar or tariquidar restored intracellular paclitaxel levels, as determined by UPLC-MS/MS, and synergistically decreased cell viability as observed in CCK-8 assay. CONCLUSION: These findings reveal that the ABCB1-mediated drug efflux is a crucial mechanism underlying paclitaxel resistance in NSCLC cells, with UPLC-MS/MS serving as a sensitive analytical method to detect paclitaxel concentration. Inhibition of ABCB1 is a promising therapeutic strategy to resensitize resistant tumor cells to paclitaxel.",
    "Thimerosal Inhibits Tumor Malignant Progression through Direct Action and Enhancing the Efficacy of PD-1-Based Immunotherapy.. Wang P, Chen YH, Zhan ZT, Zeng JX, Chen Y, Lin Y, Chen T, Zhou WJ (2026). BACKGROUND: Thimerosal is a mercury-containing preservative widely used in vaccines. This study aimed to investigate its potential antitumor effects and mechanisms in solid malignancies, particularly colorectal cancer (CRC) and melanoma. METHODS: A combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches was employed. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion were assessed using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), colony formation, ATP viability, Western blotting, flow cytometry, wound-healing and Transwell assays. Subcutaneous, lung metastases, and Azoxymethane/Dextran Sulfate Sodium Salt (AOM/DSS)-induced colitis-associated CRC models were established to examine antitumor efficacy and safety. The functional role of mercury ions was validated using structural analogues. Mechanistic studies included RNA sequencing, Western blot, and immunohistochemical analysis of CD8+ T cell infiltration. The synergistic effect with programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibody therapy was also evaluated. RESULTS: Thimerosal potently inhibited tumor growth (with IC50 values ranging from 0.1 to 1 μM in vitro) and significantly prolonged survival without overt toxicity in vivo. Mechanistically, mercury ions were identified as critical functional sites mediating Thimerosal's antitumor effects. Specifically, Thimerosal inhibited the phosphorylation of Janus kinase 1(JAK1) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Furthermore, it enhanced the infiltration of CD8+ T cells into the tumor microenvironment and synergistically augmented the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy. CONCLUSION: Thimerosal exerts dual antitumor roles by direct JAK1/STAT3 inhibition and immune modulation via CD8+ T cell recruitment. It represents a promising repurposed drug and immunotherapeutic adjuvant for CRC and melanoma.",
    "Actinidia chinensis Planch Root extracts trigger ferroptosis in colorectal cancer via the p53/SLC7A11/GPX4 axis.. Ma C, Chen R, Wang H, Qiu K, Xia Q, Yang S, Wang J, Cheng Z, Cui W, Lu J, Duan S (2026). PURPOSE: Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Actinidia chinensis Planch Root extracts (acRoots), a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), possess recognized anticancer properties, but their efficacy and mechanism in Colorectal cancer are not fully understood. This study investigates the role of acRoots in suppressing Colorectal cancer progression, with a specific focus on its potential to induce ferroptosis, a form of iron-dependent cell death. METHODS: The anti-tumor effects of acRoots were evaluated in human Colorectal cancer cell lines (HCT-15, CW-2) using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), colony formation, wound healing, and Transwell assays. Cell death was analyzed by Annexin V-FITC/PI flow cytometry. Mechanisms were probed by measuring reactive oxygen species (ROS), glutathione (GSH) levels, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, and performing qRT-PCR and Western blot for ferroptosis-related markers (SLC7A11, GPX4, p53). The ferroptosis inhibitor Ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) was used in rescue experiments. The in vivo antitumor efficacy was assessed in HCT-15 xenograft models in nude mice treated orally with acRoots (150 mg/kg/day) for 14 days. RESULTS: The acRoots significantly and dose-dependently inhibits the viability, proliferation, migration, and invasion of colorectal cancer cells. Concurrently, acRoots effectively induces ferroptosis in these cells, characterized by intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, glutathione (GSH) depletion, and a significant increase in the lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde (MDA). These ferroptosis-related phenotypes can be reversed by the ferroptosis-specific inhibitor Ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1). Mechanistically, acRoots upregulates the expression of the tumor suppressor gene p53, subsequently downregulating the expression levels of key ferroptosis regulators SLC7A11 and GPX4. Furthermore, pretreatment with Fer-1 effectively reverses acRoots-induced cytotoxicity and ROS accumulation. In an HCT-15 xenograft mouse model, oral administration of acRoots (150 mg/kg/day) significantly inhibited tumor growth, reduced intratumoral GSH levels, and no obvious toxicity was observed. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that acRoots exerts potent anti-Colorectal cancer effects by inhibiting malignant phenotypes and inducing ferroptosis. This ferroptosis is mediated, at least in part, through the p53-dependent downregulation of the SLC7A11/GPX4 axis. These results position acRoots as a promising therapeutic candidate and a novel natural ferroptosis inducer for Colorectal cancer treatment, warranting further clinical investigation.",
    "Concordant Patterns of Population Genetic Structure and Symbiont Communities in a Broadcasting Spawning Coral Along a Western Australian Fringing Reef.. Duffy SL, Kennington WJ, Richards ZT, Thomas L (2026). The degree of connectivity across ecosystems is a key determinant of resilience, directly influencing recovery potential after disturbance and long-term ecosystem stability. In reef-building corals, there is added complexity to these processes because both the coral host and their symbiotic dinoflagellates determine resilience. Given these complexities, we investigated the connectivity of a broadcast spawning coral and its associated algal symbiont communities along the Ningaloo Reef Marine Park and Muiron Island Management Area. Using reduced representation sequencing and DNA metabarcoding in 158 colonies of Acropora cf. tenuis across 14 sampling sites, we detected significant spatial genetic structure in the coral host consistent with a pattern of isolation by distance (IBD). Spatial Autocorrelation analyses revealed that the genetic neighbourhood extends up to 50 km suggesting that this coral species has multiple demographically independent populations across Ningaloo Reef. Symbiont communities were dominated by Cladocopium and followed a similar IBD pattern of between-site differences in community composition. We did not identify a significant correlation between host genetic diversity and symbiont community diversity at the colony level. However, spatial patterns of genetic differentiation between sample sites for the host and symbiont community composition were significantly associated suggesting that connectivity along a fringing reef system for both coral hosts and their symbionts is driven by similar biogeographic factors.",
    "Severe Congenital Neutropenia With Negative Whole-Exome Sequencing Managed With Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation: A Case Report.. Albar RF, Abdulaziz AA, Merdad AH, Felemban BS (2026). Kostmann syndrome, also known as severe congenital neutropenia, is a congenital disorder characterized by genetic mutations that prevent the progression of myeloid differentiation in the bone marrow. Most cases are associated with specific genetic mutations, including those in HAX1 and ELANE. Treatment with antibiotics and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is primarily prophylactic. We report a pediatric case of severe congenital neutropenia present since birth, with negative whole-exome sequencing (WES), complicated by multiple hospital admissions for recurrent infections and subsequent progression to myelodysplastic syndrome with excess blasts associated with monosomy 7, for which the patient ultimately underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). This case highlights that many patients with Kostmann syndrome can present with negative genetic testing and draws attention to the importance of surveillance for malignant transformation.",
    "Pinellia pedatisecta Schott-Derived Exosome-Like Nanovesicles Promote Apoptosis in Colorectal Cancer by Regulating the Lysosome-Mediated Mitophagy Pathway.. Zhou P, Zhang Q, Zhou X, Zhang G, Cheng S (2026). Plant-derived exosome-like nanovesicles (ELNs) have shown potential in the treatment of various diseases. This research sought to investigate the effects of Pinellia pedatisecta Schott-derived ELNs (PPS-ELNs) on colorectal cancer (CRC). PPS-ELNs extracted from Pinellia pedatisecta Schott were characterized. CRC cell lines HCT116 and HT-29 were exposed to 10 μg/mL of PPS-ELNs. Normal colon epithelial cells FHC were treated with different concentrations of PPS-ELNs. CRC mice were treated with 12.5 or 25 mg/kg of PPS-ELNs. Subsequent experiments, including cellular uptake assay, CCK-8 assay, colony formation assay, flow cytometry, Western blot, transmission electron microscopy, LysoTracker Red staining, immunofluorescence, ELISA, in vivo imaging, TUNEL staining, immunohistochemistry, HE staining, and biochemical analysis, were conducted to explore the anti-CRC effects and potential mechanisms of PPS-ELNs. Lysosome inhibitor chloroquine was employed to elucidate the underlying mechanism in vitro. The isolated PPS-ELNs were successfully characterized. Cellular uptake of PPS-ELNs was observed in CRC cell lines. Notably, PPS-ELNs did not affect FHC cell viability, while significantly inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis and mitophagy in CRC cell lines. Furthermore, PPS-ELNs induced oxidative stress and reduced lysosomal damage in HCT116 cells. The effects of PPS-ELNs on HCT116 cells were reversed by chloroquine. In CRC mice, PPS-ELNs were primarily accumulated in tumors. PPS-ELNs markedly reduced tumor growth, induced apoptosis, and decreased Ki67 expression. Additionally, PPS-ELNs decreased Gal3 expression, increased autophagosomes, and altered mitophagy-related protein levels in tumor tissues. Importantly, PPS-ELNs displayed an excellent safety profile in vivo. PPS-ELNs inhibit CRC progression through the lysosome-mediated mitophagy pathway.",
    "COL23A1 promotes tumor progression and glycolytic reprogramming in endometrial cancer via METTL14-m6A-YTHDF1 axis.. Wu H, Ke M, Feng X, Li Z, Luo Y, Bian F, Liao J, Tang R (2026). UNLABELLED: Endometrial cancer (EC) is one of the most common gynecological malignancies, and its progression is tightly linked to extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and metabolic reprogramming. Collagen type XXIII alpha 1 (COL23A1), a transmembrane collagen, has been implicated in several cancers, but its expression pattern, functional role and upstream regulation in EC remain unclear. Public datasets (TCGA, GTEx, cBioPortal) were analyzed to characterize COL23A1 expression, clinicopathological correlations and prognostic value. The biological functions of COL23A1 in EC cells were assessed by qRT-PCR, Western blotting, CCK-8, colony formation, flow cytometry, Transwell assays and Seahorse extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and oxygen consumption rate (OCR) measurements. Untargeted metabolomics and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) were used to interrogate glycolytic metabolism and m⁶A modification. Xenograft models were established to validate the in vivo effects of COL23A1. COL23A1 was significantly upregulated in EC tissues and correlated with advanced clinicopathological features and poor overall survival. Genetic silencing of COL23A1 suppressed EC cell proliferation, clonogenicity, migration and invasion in vitro, and inhibited tumor growth in vivo. At the metabolic level, COL23A1 knockdown disrupted glycolytic metabolism, leading to reduced glucose uptake, lactate production, expression of key glycolytic enzymes and ECAR, accompanied by a compensatory increase in OCR. Integrative bioinformatic and experimental analyses showed that METTL14 installs m⁶A modifications on COL23A1 mRNA, whereas the m⁶A reader YTHDF1 binds and stabilizes the modified transcript, thereby sustaining COL23A1 expression. Rescue experiments demonstrated that COL23A1 is required for METTL14- and YTHDF1-driven glycolytic reprogramming and oncogenic phenotypes in EC cells. COL23A1 acts as a previously unrecognized oncogenic driver in endometrial cancer, promoting tumor progression and glycolysis-dependent metabolic reprogramming through a METTL14-m⁶A-YTHDF1-COL23A1 axis. Targeting this m⁶A-dependent pathway may offer a promising therapeutic strategy for endometrial cancer.

    "Neoadjuvant therapy-associated malignant phenotype score predicts prognosis and highlights the roles of MIF signaling and DUXAP8 in ESCC.. Xia W, Lin T, Shi M, Mu Q, Zhang H, Xu Y (2025). BACKGROUND: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remains a major malignancy globally, and long-term survival outcomes remain poor despite advances in multimodal treatment strategies. Neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) has become the standard of care for resectable ESCC; however, substantial interpatient heterogeneity in treatment response persists. Defining malignant cell-intrinsic molecular determinants linked to NAT response is essential for improving prognostic stratification and informing individualized therapeutic decision-making. METHODS: To investigate transcriptional alterations in malignant epithelial cells, we analyzed scRNA-seq datasets obtained from ESCC patients both before and after NAT. Overlapping molecular features were identified by integrating differentially expressed genes from pre- and post-treatment malignant cells with bulk RNA-seq data from TCGA and GEO cohorts. Functional enrichment analyses, pseudotime trajectory reconstruction, and transcription factor regulatory network assessments were subsequently performed. Candidate prognostic genes were initially screened through univariate Cox analysis, followed by the development of the NTAMPS model using LASSO-Cox regression. Its prognostic performance was validated in the TCGA-ESCA and GSE53624 cohorts, and clinical applicability was further examined using a nomogram, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis. Immune-related associations, immunotherapy response prediction (IMvigor210 and GSE78220), and drug sensitivity profiling were also conducted. DUXAP8, which carried the largest coefficient in the NTAMPS, was selected for further validation through both in vivo and in vitro assays, including qRT-PCR and evaluations of cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and colony formation. RESULTS: Malignant epithelial cells exhibited pronounced transcriptional remodeling after NAT, characterized by enrichment of pathways related to the cell cycle, DNA replication, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Cell-cell communication analysis revealed substantial reorganization of the MIF signaling pathway, including increased interactions of MIF-ACKR3 and MIF-(CD74+CXCR4/CD44), with fibroblasts acting as major signal senders and macrophages serving as primary receivers. Twenty-one prognosis-related genes were identified, and a ten-gene NTAMPS demonstrated strong prognostic performance. Both NTAMPS and clinical stage emerged as independent prognostic factors and were integrated into a nomogram with favorable calibration and decision curve characteristics. A high NTAMPS was associated with an immunosuppressive microenvironment, reduced predicted response to immunotherapy, and distinct drug sensitivity patterns. DUXAP8, the top positive risk gene within NTAMPS, was highly expressed in ESCC tissues and cell lines, and its silencing suppressed cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and clonogenic potential. CONCLUSION: This study establishes NTAMPS as a novel malignant cell-derived prognostic signature for ESCC by integrating single-cell and bulk transcriptomic data. NTAMPS enables effective prognostic stratification, predicts potential immunotherapy benefit, and highlights therapeutic vulnerabilities. DUXAP8 was further identified as a candidate molecular driver that may improve ESCC management in the context of neoadjuvant therapy.",
    "Could hair cortisol in free-ranging cattle be a proxy of wolf predation patterns?. Rafael M, Fonseca E, Santos N, Nakamura M (2026). Cortisol is a biomarker of grey wolf (Canis lupus) prey selection on wild ungulates. Throughout its range, wolves may prey on free-range livestock, leading to conflicts with humans. This can compromise wolf conservation through culling or poaching. We investigate whether glucocorticoid concentration could be a biomarker of individual prey selection by grey wolves that depredate on free-ranging cattle (Bos taurus). To achieve this, cortisol concentration in hair samples from live (n = 46) and wolf-preyed (n = 19) cattle was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The effects of intrinsic and extrinsic variables-namely age, sex and food availability-on hair cortisol concentration (HCC) were investigated through linear mixed models with farm as a random effect. The analysis revealed that, against our initial hypothesis, wolf-preyed cattle had significantly lower HCC than live cattle (P = 0.009). Additionally, HCC was lower in subadults than in adults (P = 0.002), and was negatively correlated with food availability in adults, but not in subadults (P = 0.003). These results suggest that predation risk does not necessarily equal long-term physiological stress. Alternatively, it may indicate that cattle chronically exposed to stressors (i.e. presenting higher HCC) may exhibit more effective anti-predatory behaviours. Additionally, food availability for cattle may influence wolf predation patterns, as cattle may expand their foraging area by exploring unfamiliar areas, thereby increasing the likelihood of predator encounters. Further research is required to understand the relationship between the multitude of stressors acting on free-range cattle and wolf prey selection, with the aim of assessing the risk of individual cattle and eventually managing predation risk and human-wolf conflict.",
    "Biomarkers of foraging and reproduction in captive adult female hawksbill sea turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata).. Kent JB, Dawson KR, Fukada S, Makabe M, Kawazu I, Maeda K, Valverde RA (2026). Hawksbill sea turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata) are listed as critically endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). To implement best conservation practices for this species, its biology should be well understood. Attempting to characterize the foraging physiology of free-ranging hawksbill sea turtles is complicated by the fact that sampling is typically limited to nesting females during the reproductive season. Without data from non-reproductive periods, it is difficult to determine whether observed physiological values reflect baseline conditions or are specific to the energetically demanding nesting season. Accordingly, in this study, we described the physiology of foraging in a captive-held population of hawksbill sea turtles for an entire year. Across the year, we sampled a total of five captive adult female hawksbills at the Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium in Okinawa, Japan. We measured the concentration of β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), triglycerides (TRGs) and testosterone. Foraging biomarkers BHB and TRGs were both significantly higher during gonadal recrudescence and breeding than during gonadal quiescence, consistent with mature animals that were not foraging actively during breeding activities. Testosterone concentration also was higher during breeding months than during non-breeding months, especially in May, which marked the onset of mating. Elevated BHB during breeding activities indicated that captive hawksbills accumulated energy reserves during the non-breeding season to invest it in breeding activities. Additionally, elevated TRGs are correlated to vitellogenesis occurring in the breeding female hawksbills.",
    "Markedly Increased Diamine Oxidase During Acute Anaphylaxis Is Associated With an Underlying Clonal Mast Cell Disorder.. Rijavec M, Kogovšek Ž, Inkret J, Kopač P, Košnik M, Korošec P (2026). INTRODUCTION: Diamine oxidase (DAO) degrades histamine, the key mediator in anaphylaxis, yet its relationship with clonal mast cell disorder (CMD) in the context of anaphylaxis is unclear. We evaluated whether DAO during anaphylaxis differs by CMD status. METHODS: We enrolled 35 emergency-department patients with acute anaphylaxis to drugs (7 patients), food (2 patients), or Hymenoptera venom (26 patients). Tryptase, DAO, and histamine degradation were measured during anaphylaxis and convalescence. CMD was defined by detecting KIT p.D816V in peripheral blood leukocytes using highly sensitive qPCR. Post-mortem DAO and tryptase were also compared in two fatal Hymenoptera venom-triggered anaphylaxis (HVA) cases with CMD versus 13 non-anaphylaxis controls. RESULTS: KIT p.D816V was detected in 6 (17%); all had severe HVA and normal basal tryptase. During anaphylaxis, DAO increased markedly in CMD (median 1142%), but only modestly in KIT p.D816V-negative patients (median 20%; p < 0.0001), independent of trigger or severity. Acute DAO was ~5-fold higher in CMD (median 101 vs. 18 U/mL), while convalescent DAO was similar (both 14 U/mL). Despite markedly elevated DAO, we observed impaired histamine degradation in acute anaphylaxis plasma. Receiver-operating-characteristic analyses showed strong discrimination for CMD using acute DAO (AUC 0.92; cut-off 53 U/mL; sensitivity 83%; specificity 97%) and percentage increase from convalescence (AUC 0.97; cut-off 223%; sensitivity 83%; specificity 100%). Post-mortem DAO lacked specificity, whereas post-mortem tryptase supported the diagnosis of fatal anaphylaxis and CMD. CONCLUSION: DAO concentrations rise markedly during anaphylaxis in CMD and may help identify individuals at the highest risk. Further studies should refine the diagnostic utility and elucidate the mechanisms by which DAO may amplify anaphylaxis in CMD.",
    "Surgeons' personal cloth scrub caps: harmless perk or implicit infection prevention risk?. Hughes J, Pilc EM, Bridges C, Tuten HR (2026). BACKGROUND: Many hospitals are implementing requirements for disposable-only scrub caps in the operating room as an infection prevention measure. Current literature has not identified a significant difference in the infection risk between cloth and disposable scrub caps. This study seeks to address this issue at the cap level by determining the difference in bacterial colonization between cloth and paper scrub caps. With consideration for potential contamination associated with environments beyond the operating room, it was predicted that personal cloth scrub caps would have a higher infectious load than disposable caps. METHODS: This study was designed as a prospective cohort study at a non-profit, 391 bed medical center in the United States. The sample included scrub caps from 107 medical personnel within the sterile field, including surgeons, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, surgical assistants, and scrub nurses. Medical personnel wore the cap style and material of their choice. The swab collections were cultured for 3 days on blood agar plates and were evaluated for bacterial colony growth and were quantified on the following scale: 0 – no bacterial growth, 1 – few colonies, 2 – several colonies, but less than 50% coverage, 3 – significant colonization at over 50% coverage, and 4 – full or nearly full colonization. The data was then calculated for statistical significance. RESULTS: A total of 107 samples were obtained, including 58 from cloth scrub caps and 49 from paper scrub caps. On disposable paper caps, the mean number of colony forming units was 1.06 (SD = 3.60), and the mean growth rank was 0.20 (SD = 0.61). On reusable cloth caps, the mean number of colony forming units was 5.16 (SD = 11.78), and the mean growth rank was 0.93 (SD = 0.99). Using a Mann-Whitney U test to evaluate the effect of cap type on colony forming units and growth rank, reusable cloth caps were found to be associated with increased colony forming units (p < 0.001) and increased growth rank (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Reusable cloth scrub caps were found to have more colony forming units and higher growth ranks than disposable paper scrub caps. Attention should be given to the proper sterilization of cloth scrub caps in order to decrease the infectious load on items in the operating room.",
    "Fucosylation enhances CD34⁺ hematopoietic stem cell homing and longevity via E-selectin-mediated adhesion and signaling.. Al-Amoodi AS, Alghuneim AA, Malki JS, Nozue S, Li Y, Kai J, Zhang H, Bensaddek D, Abdel-Aziz AK, Habuchi S, Merzaban JS (2026). BACKGROUND: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a cornerstone treatment for blood disorders and hematological malignancies, although its efficacy is limited by inefficient stem cell homing to the bone marrow. We previously demonstrated that fucosylated HSC ligands interact with endothelial E-selectin to facilitate homing. However, the downstream consequences of modulating fucosylation in HSCs remain unclear. Here, we systematically characterized how enhancing or inhibiting fucosylation-via recombinant human fucosyltransferase 6 (FTVI) or 2-fluoro-L-fucose (2FF), respectively-affects migration, signaling, and engraftment of human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor-mobilized peripheral blood CD34⁺ (mPB-CD34⁺) cells. METHODS: Live-cell imaging under flow, phosphoproteomics, and transcriptomics were used to characterize rolling dynamics and intracellular signaling, and in vivo homing was assessed in immunodeficient xenograft mouse models. RESULTS: Fucosylation enhanced tether and sling formation, improved E-selectin binding, and increased homing to the bone marrow and spleen. FTVI-treated cells activated MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways and showed enriched Rho-GTPase signaling, associated with proliferation and migration. In contrast, 2FF-treated cells had impaired migration and reduced rolling efficiency. Long-term xenograft studies showed enhanced bone marrow engraftment/persistence of fucosylated cells without altering lineage output. CONCLUSION: Fucosylation critically modulates E-selectin interactions, migration, and intracellular signaling in HSCs. These findings highlight glycoengineering as a promising strategy to enhance HSC transplantation outcomes in cancer therapy.",
    "Influence of Nest Microbiota on Hatching Success of Caretta Caretta on Lampedusa Island.. Capri FC, Prazzi E, Casamento G, Alduina R (2026). Egg hatching success in sea turtle nests can be influenced by multiple abiotic and biotic factors. Although interest in nest microbiota as a determinant of embryo development and viability is increasing, its role has not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, we profiled the bacterial communities of four Caretta caretta nests on Lampedusa Island: Cala Pisana (P1 and P2) and Spiaggia dei Conigli (C1 and C2), which showed different hatching success rates (P1 = 85.2%, P2 = 1.1%, C1 = 1.1%, C2 = 0.0%). Using 16S rRNA gene (V3-V4) sequencing, we analyzed different sample types, including sand from inside and outside the nest chamber, eggshells, and inner membranes. Alpha diversity was highest in sand and lower in eggshells and inner membranes. β-diversity clearly separated the only successful nest (P1) from the others (P2, C1, and C2) (PERMANOVA p < 0.001). Across all nests, the dominant phyla were Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteriota, and Bacteroidota; notably, the Firmicutes/Bacteroidota (F/B) ratio was lowest in P1 compared with P2, C1, and C2. Nests with low hatching success were Firmicutes-dominated, enriched in Bacillus and Pseudomonas, and harbored hydrocarbon-degrading genera (Pseudoxanthomonas and Devosia), suggesting environmental influences. Opportunistic pathogens (Ochrobactrum and Simkaniaceae), likely associated with vertical transmission, were detected exclusively in C1 and C2 nests. Overall, our findings highlight the potentially critical role of nest microbiota in reproductive success. Both vertical (maternal) and horizontal (environmental and anthropogenic) transmission appear to shape microbial composition, potentially affecting hatchling viability and offering useful insights for conservation monitoring.",
    "Identification of the genetic basis of a CO(2)-dependent Staphylococcus aureus small-colony variant isolated from pacemaker leads.. Negishi T, Higuma Y, Takeda A, Hachiro A, Natori T, Horiuchi K, Ishimine N, Uehara T, Matsumoto T (2026). PURPOSE: Small-colony variants (SCVs) are a slow-growing subset of bacteria that exhibit unusual colony morphology and unique biochemical characteristics. They are associated with chronic and persistent infections. CO2-dependent SCVs of Staphylococcus aureus have been rarely isolated from clinical specimens. This study aimed to characterize the CO2-dependent phenotype of S. aureus SCV isolated from pacemaker leads and to determine the genetic basis underlying this trait. METHODS: CO2-dependent S. aureus SCV-5700 isolated from pacemaker leads of a patient with a pacemaker infection was used in this study. Phenotypic testing, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and mecA polymerase chain reaction of the isolate were performed. Moreover, whole-genome sequencing was conducted for multilocus sequence typing and comparative genomic analysis. RESULTS: CO2-dependent S. aureus SCV-5700 grew poorly under ambient air conditions; however, tiny colonies formed after 48 h incubation. The isolate was sequence type 45 and did not harbor the mecA. The isolate was identified as S. aureus by biochemical characterization in a 5 % CO2 atmosphere. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that the isolate had a nonsense mutation (c.565C>T) in the mpsB; however, the revertant strain, Rev-5700, had no such mutation. CONCLUSION: The CO2-dependent phenotype of clinical S. aureus isolates can be attributed, in part, to loss of MpsB function.",
    "Modeling how hunting strategies and pack size shape each other.. Dutykh D, Escobedo R, Spector L (2026). Social foraging exhibits unexpected features, such as the existence of a group size threshold above which hunting success is not improved, mainly because, above this threshold, additional individuals are free-riders that withhold effort. These observations have been supported by computational models of group hunting, which reveal a mechanism that causes hunting success to peak at small group sizes. In the model, hunters follow two simple rules: approach the prey until a safe distance is reached, and when closer to the prey than a critical avoidance distance, move away from other hunters. The mechanism is that the spatial configuration that the hunters adopt during the hunt is disrupted by the excessive number of participants. Direct observations of wolves (Canis lupus) in Yellowstone Park have shown that the group size threshold when hunting bison (Bison bison), their most formidable prey, is nearly three times greater than when hunting elk (Cervus elaphus). However, the relationship between prey type and the threshold pack size is complex and non-linear, driven by a feedback loop: hunting strategies are adjusted based on prey size and behaviour, which in turn affects the formation and effectiveness of the pack. This study explores how prey size influences the optimal pack size and vice versa. Our analysis confirms the non-linearity of this relationship. As the size and danger of the prey change, the optimal pack size does not follow a simple linear pattern. Instead, it reflects a more complex interaction, where both prey characteristics and wolf hunting strategies determine the most effective group size. This complexity arises from the need to balance the pressure exerted on the prey with the spatial arrangement of the pack. The feedback loop between hunting success and pack size illustrates how adaptations in hunting strategies lead to changes in pack organization, which then impact hunting success. This dynamic interaction underlines the need for models that account for these complex interactions to better understand and predict the behavior of wolf packs in different prey scenarios.",
    "Safety of a remote disease management program to improve sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists prescribing in type 2 diabetes with elevated cardiovascular or kidney risk.. Chang LS, Hassan S, Chasse J, Stern G, Gabovitch D, Zelle D, Colling C, Crossen J, Aronson SJ, Oates M, Figueroa C, Collins E, Ruggiero R, Plutzky J, Gaziano TA, Cannon CP, Wexler DJ, Scirica BM, Blood AJ (2026). BACKGROUND: Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1 RA) reduce cardiovascular and kidney risk in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), yet real-world use remains suboptimal. Remote care models offer a promising approach to improve access; there is limited data on the safety of and adverse events (AEs) associated with prescribing and titrating these therapies through a protocol-driven remote management program. METHODS: The DRIVE trial was a pragmatic, randomized clinical trial evaluating the safety of a remote disease management program that initiated SGLT2i and/or GLP1 RA in patients with T2D and elevated cardiovascular or kidney risk. Participants were enrolled at a large integrated health care system in Massachusetts between March 2021 and December 2022. Participants were randomized to one of two implementation strategies: a sequential approach (two months of education first followed by medication initiation) or a bundled approach (simultaneous education and medication initiation). Non-clinical navigators and clinical pharmacists, supervised by physicians, oversaw medication initiation and monitoring under a collaborative drug therapy management agreement and protocol that included algorithms for initiation and titration of SGLT2i and GLP1 RA, as well as adjustment of concurrent glucose-lowering medications to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia Safety outcomes were collected through chart review and patient report, including targeted AEs, hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and urgent care visits. Targeted AEs were prospectively collected over the first six months after enrollment: for SGLT2i initiators, symptoms of genital mycotic infection, urinary tract infection, or volume depletion; for GLP 1 RA initiators, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and urgent care visits over the first six months after enrollment were retrospectively collected through electronic health record review. RESULTS: Of 200 participants enrolled, 106 (53%) initiated SGLT2i (n=68) or GLP1 RA (n=40). Among SGLT2i users, 29.4% reported an AE, most commonly genital mycotic infections (10.3%) and symptoms of volume depletion (11.8%); 10.3% discontinued due to AEs. Among GLP1 RA users, 55.0% experienced AEs, predominantly gastrointestinal; 10.0% discontinued due to AEs. No severe hypoglycemia, emergency department visits, or hospitalizations occurred. CONCLUSIONS: A remote, pharmacist- and navigator-led program safely initiated SGLT2i and GLP1 RA in a high-risk T2D population, with AE rates comparable to clinical trials and high persistence. These findings support the feasibility of remote prescribing with appropriate clinical oversight and structured AE management.

    "Er:YAG (λ2940nm) microablation of supragingival biofilm in patients with fixed orthodontic appliances.. Soares LGP, Sérgio AFA, da Silva APLT, Nunes IPF, Habib FAL, Pinheiro ALB (2026). The objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of the Er:YAG laser in controlling supragingival biofilm in patients wearing fixed orthodontic appliances. In this randomized, single-session, pre-post intervention study, the sample consisted of 18 individuals undergoing orthodontic treatment at the Prof. José Édimo Soares Martins Center for Orthodontics and Facial Orthopedics, FOUFBA. The Er:YAG laser (λ2940 nm, 0.8 W, 20 Hz, ED = 0.16 J/cm2, t = 30s) was applied to the cervical region of the right mandibular lateral incisor, at an average distance of 10 mm from the tooth surface. The collections occurred before the intervention (Control Group) and after irradiation with Er:YAG (Laser Group). The samples were inoculated in Petri dishes for visual counting of colony-forming units (CFU). After tabulation and logarithmic transformation of the data obtained, the ANOVA test (General Linear Model) was applied to verify the existence of a significant difference between the groups. Results showed that the logarithmic means of the Control and Laser Groups' CFU count were 5.08 ± 0.71 and 3.04 ± 0.88, respectively. The group comparison showed a significant decrease (ANOVA, F = 58.43; p < 0.001), with a 99% reduction in CFU. In conclusion, Er:YAG laser microablation quickly reduces biofilm in orthodontic patients, offering a promising adjunct to conventional hygiene.",
    "The mechanism of acetyl-L-carnitine on colorectal cancer and its metabolomic study.. Ning J, Cai C, Fan X, Liao C, Shen M (2026). Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a prevalent malignancy worldwide, with increasing incidence and mortality rates. Acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC), a natural form of L-carnitine, possesses anti-inflammatory, free radical-scavenging, and mitochondrial membrane-stabilizing properties. However, its precise mechanism of action in CRC remains unclear. To articulate the mechanism of action of ALC in CRC, we investigated its biological activity in HCT116 cells and a nude mouse xenograft model. The effects of ALC on HCT116 cells using CCK-8, colony formation, migration, invasion, and cell cycle assays. And detected oxidative stress-related indexes including reactive oxygen species (ROS), glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), and superoxide dismutase (SOD). The inhibitory effect of ALC on colorectal tumor growth was further validated in a nude mouse xenograft model, and untargeted metabolomic analysis was performed using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The results showed that ALC can inhibit the proliferation and migration of HCT116 cells, induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and affect the changes of oxidative stress indexes, and exacerbating cellular oxidative stress damage. In vivo experiments demonstrated that ALC effectively suppressed colorectal tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner. Plasma metabolomic analysis identified 10 differential metabolites between the ALC group and the control group, including meisoindigo, indole-3-acetaldehyde, etc., and 4 tumor differential metabolites, including L-proline, 3,4,5-Trimethoxytoluene, etc. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed that ALC altered 6 metabolic pathways in plasma, including tryptophan metabolism and glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism, and 5 pathways in tumor tissue, including arginine and proline metabolism and the sphingolipid signaling pathway. These findings provide novel theoretical evidence for the antitumor mechanisms of ALC in CRC.",
    "OTUB1/SLC7A11 axis promoted AKT signaling activation to mediate ovarian cancer progression.. Zhang Y, Wang J, Sun S, Cao W, Ren J, Yang W (2026). PURPOSE: OTUB1 functions as a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) and has been reported to be associated with tumor progression. This study aimed to investigate the role of OTUB1 signaling in ovarian cancer progression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-five patients diagnosed with ovarian cancer were enrolled and divided into groups based on tumor stage (high/low) and the presence or absence of lymphatic metastasis to analyze OTUB1 expression via Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. Data from 578 ovarian cancer patients sourced from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were downloaded for survival analysis. Cell proliferation and migration were evaluated using CCK8 and Transwell assays. Western blotting and immunostaining were performed to assess the activation of the OTUB1/SLC7A11/AKT signaling pathway. RESULTS: Our study found that OTUB1 expression was upregulated in ovarian cancer tissues and that higher expression was associated with poor prognosis, and more intriguingly, high-stage and lymph node metastasis ovarian cancer samples exhibited significantly elevated expression of OTUB1.Through in vitro experimental validation, OTUB1 overexpression in ovarian cancer cells promoted the increased cell proliferation, migration, and colony formation. Moreover, OTUB1 led to the upregulation of SOX2 expression, which was implicated with cancer cell stemness. Mechanistically, we further identified that OTUB1 could upregulate SLC7A11 expression, which subsequently activated the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway to promote ovarian cancer progression. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the pro-tumor role of OTUB1/SLC7A11 in ovarian cancer through the activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, offering new insights into potential targeted therapies for ovarian cancer.",
    "Illuminating the influence of artificial light at night on the behavior of an adaptable carnivore.. Hickling CJ, Serieys LEK, Leighton GRM, Kienle SS, Bishop JM, Carroll KA (2026). Artificial light at night (ALAN), a pollutant closely linked to urbanization, is rapidly increasing worldwide. ALAN poses growing ecological challenges by altering wildlife movement and habitat use. However, many species have distinct and sometimes flexible behavioral responses to ALAN. Caracals (Caracal caracal) are an adaptable terrestrial carnivore capable of inhabiting urban areas yet are also sensitive to humans. We investigated how ALAN influences caracal movement, habitat selection, and foraging behavior using GPS collars and behavioral data at night. We assessed the role of direct and indirect ALAN, including total upward radiance, public streetlights, and urban skyglow, on adult (n = 17) and subadult (n = 7) caracals of both sexes using integrated step selection functions (iSSFs) to evaluate movement and habitat selection and resource selection functions (RSFs) to examine habitat selection while foraging (i.e., kill sites). We found that caracals avoided direct ALAN, as upward radiance strongly drove movement patterns. Caracals simultaneously selected areas closer to urbanization, and subadults had greater tolerance to ALAN than adults. Additionally, the interplay between urbanization and age class indicates a complex relationship in which ALAN and urbanization both constrain and potentially benefit caracals. We also found that caracal foraging was primarily influenced by direct ALAN via public street lighting, with avoidance of highly illuminated areas. Our findings illustrate that artificial light sources influence distinct yet interconnected behaviors. ALAN is a pollutant that will continue to impact wildlife and therefore disentangling how and where ALAN influences species, and the relative importance of direct and indirect ALAN, can inform mitigation and conservation strategies.",
    "Ecotoxicological biomarkers in Scopoli's shearwaters (Calonectris diomedea) from an Eastern Mediterranean colony and associations with per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in their feathers.. Tsangaris C, Patsiou D, Trypidaki E, Xirouchakis S, Zhang J, Asimakopoulos AG, Karris G (2026). Ecotoxicological biomarkers are valuable tools for assessing pollution effects in marine organisms. This study investigates a set of biomarkers in Scopoli's shearwater (Calonectris diomedea) from a colony in the Eastern Mediterranean (Strofades Islands, Ionian Sea) and examines their association with seabird size (body mass and morphometrics), sex, life stage (breeder vs prospector), and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) concentrations in feathers. The biomarker set included the micronucleus (MN) test as a biomarker of genotoxicity, glutathione-S-transferases (GST) as a biomarker of xenobiotic biotransformation, and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) as a biomarker of neurotoxicity. Our results indicate that biomarker values were not influenced by life stage, sex, or size within the sampled seabird range, supporting their suitability for contaminant assessment. Additionally, GST activity was associated with perfluoroalkane sulfonyl fluorides (PASFs) exposure, suggesting potential induction for PASFs biotransformation. Neither MN frequency nor AChE activity was influenced by PFASs concentrations in the feathers. To our knowledge, this is the first study on biomarkers of genotoxicity, biotransformation and neurotoxicity in Scopoli's shearwater. Our findings provide baseline MN frequencies, GST, and AChE activities in this species at the largest species colony in the Eastern Mediterranean and highlight the need for further research across different colonies to assess geographic variations in contaminant exposure and biomarker responses.",

    "High-precision tracking of human foragers reveals adaptive social information use in the wild.. Schakowski A, Deffner D, Kortet R, Niemelä PT, Kavelaars MM, Monk CT, Pykälä M, Kurvers RHJM (2026). Foraging complexity and competitive social challenges are considered key drivers of human cognition. Yet, the decision-making mechanisms that underlie social foraging in the real world remain unknown. Integrating high-precision Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking and video footage from large-scale foraging competitions with cognitive-computational modeling and agent-based simulations, we show how foragers integrate personal, social, and ecological information to guide spatial search and patch-leaving decisions. We show how the social context emerges as a key driver of foraging dynamics. Foragers adaptively rely on social information to locate resources when unsuccessful and extend giving-up times in the presence of others, which results in increased area-restricted search at high social densities. These findings demonstrate the importance of sociality for human foraging decisions and provide a template for harnessing high-resolution tracking data to study real-world cognition.",
    "Nutritional specialization and social evolution in woodroaches and termites.. Cui Y, Liu F, Yuan D, Liao M, Li Z, Luan YX, Yu S, Zhu K, Gao Q, Cheng Y, Fang G, Wang Z, Zhu S, Xu J, Wang S, Herrera MS, Huang Q, Su X, Wang Z, Xiang H, Lo N, Boomsma JJ, Zhan S, Li S (2026). Woodroach biparental-care and termite sibling-altruism evolved from solitary cockroach ancestors following nutritional specialization on nutrient-deficient dead-wood, but the accompanying genomic changes remained unclear. We sequenced eight new Blattodea species showing stepwise contracted genomes. Woodroach brood-rearing remained constrained by deactivated oxidative phosphorylation and peroxisome genes, consistent with slow immature growth. Termites lost key genes mediating sperm motility, corroborating that reproductive division of labor required monogamous colony-founding. They also co-opted many genes from fundamental nutrition-sensitive juvenile hormone, insulin, EGFR and Dpp signaling pathways. Thus, most larvae develop as workers via high energy metabolism early on, while reproductive nymphs highly express energy metabolism genes late in development. These pathways are consistent with obligate dependence on provisioning by specialized workers and feedback loops allowing large homeostatic colonies to evolve.",
    "Efficacy of pegfilgrastim in preventing febrile neutropenia during DCF chemotherapy for esophageal cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.. Hemdan K, El Tabakh RM, Elmezayen ZW, Yousef AM, Hussein A, Elghareab AM, Shehata MM, Ellethey AA, Oun A (2026). BackgroundEsophageal cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil (DCF) chemotherapy being a standard treatment option for locally advanced disease. However, DCF is associated with a high incidence of febrile neutropenia (FN), a serious complication that can lead to treatment delays, hospitalizations, and increased morbidity. Pegfilgrastim, a long-acting granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), is recommended for FN prevention, but its efficacy in esophageal cancer patients receiving DCF chemotherapy remains unclear.MethodsA systematic literature search of PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Web of Science identified eligible studies. Retrospective and prospective studies comparing prophylactic pegfilgrastim with placebo or no G-CSF in patients undergoing DCF therapy were included. Eight reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed quality using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The extracted data were then verified by two additional reviewers. A meta-analysis was conducted to calculate pooled effect sizes.ResultsPooled analysis showed that pegfilgrastim significantly reduced FN incidence (OR = 0.283, 95% CI: 0.102-0.782, p = 0.015). FN rates ranged from 3.3% to 30.8% in the pegfilgrastim group versus 26.7% to 60.6% in the control group. Pegfilgrastim was also associated with lower rates of severe neutropenia and shorter hospital stays, with no significant increase in adverse events.ConclusionsIn our study, Pegfilgrastim prophylaxis significantly reduces FN risk, severe neutropenia, and hospital stays in esophageal cancer patients receiving DCF chemotherapy, without increasing major complications. These findings support its routine use in this population, though further prospective randomized trials are needed to optimize dosing strategies and confirm long-term benefits.",
    "Behavioural Effects of Persistent Human Disturbance: A Playback Experiment in a Forest Bird.. Liker A, Sinkovics C, Sándor K, Bukor B, Nagy N, Ódor L, Klucsik KP, Ágh N (2026). Increasing human presence and activities expose wild animals to persistent disturbances. Disturbed populations often become tolerant towards humans, although the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We used playback experiments to manipulate perceived level of human disturbance in great tits (Parus major). In the first year, incubating females remained more often on the nest, and parents during brood care exhibited a lower level of vigilance and tended to have shorter return latencies in the human disturbance treatment than in control treatments, demonstrating an increased tolerance. These differences disappeared in the second year. Tolerance was also influenced by distance to roads and the frequency of nest visits by researchers. These results support that behavioural tolerance can quickly emerge by phenotypic plasticity in natural populations, although other mechanisms may also influence behavioural responses after longer exposure to human disturbances, resulting in a complex set of processes involved in the spread of tolerance.",
    "Sitting on the fence: Individuals, distributions, and reproductive strategies in the bird's nest fungus Nidula candida.. Petersons L, Berbee ML (2026). Bird's nest fungi (Nidula candida) growing along ~18-year-old cedar fences in Pacific Spirit Regional Park, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, produce abundant, persistent peridia containing basidiospore-bearing, egg-like peridioles. To reconstruct the initial mode of reproduction of the populations, 37 peridia were collected following a geometric sampling design, with 8-10 peridia collected 6-222 cm apart from each of four fence segments. We cultured dikaryotic mycelium from one whole peridiole from each peridium and 105 monokaryons from basidiospores from 8 peridioles. We then tested mycelial compatibility by confronting pairs of dikaryons and sexual compatibility by mating the monokaryons from basidiospores. The resulting genetic patterns allowed us to map genetic individuals back to their fence segments. The dikaryotic mycelia that grew from whole peridioles fell into six mycelial compatibility groups, with one or two groups per 3-7 m fence segment. Consistent with an outcrossing origin, four different mycelial compatibility groups had different mating types. The largest compatibility group covered over 6 m of fence, producing 114 peridia and ~4.2 billion spores. One compatibility group was present at two fence sites ~40 m apart, suggesting asexual dispersal. This can potentially be explained by somatic growth from the walls of dispersed peridioles. Dikaryons generated by mating sibling monokaryons isolated from basidiospores from the same peridiole showed mycelial incompatibility in 86% of pairings. Thus, the compatible dikaryotic mycelia emerging from whole peridioles likely represent clones of parental mycelium rather than recombinant meiotic hyphae from basidiospores. Asexual reproduction from dispersed fruit body tissue is unusual in Agaricales, but in N. candida fence-hopping of peridioles splashed from peridia and germinating as clonal, parental-type dikaryotic mycelia may have contributed to expansion of a genet along the fence.",
    "Garcinol, a natural benzophenone overcomes radio and chemoresistance by targeting PI3K-PKB/AKT pathway in rhabdomyosarcoma cells.. Rangappa S (2025). AKT signaling pathway is a critical intracellular signaling pathway involved in regulating various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, cell survival, cell migration and metabolism. Cancer cells have a propensity to alter the expression of pro- and anti-angiogenic signals to activate the angiogenic switch. Aberrant overexpression of AKT pathway is associated with various types of cancers and enables the migration and invasion of tumor cells to neighboring tissues. Garcinol, a natural benzophenone, displays potent anticancer potential against various cancer cells, but its mechanism of action in inducing apoptosis remains unclear. The present study aimed to unveil the mechanism of action of garcinol in inducing apoptosis in rhabdomyosarcoma cells. Garcinol inhibited cell proliferation, reduced the viability of cancer cells, diminished colony formation, and mitigated the migratory capabilities of Rh cells. In vitro analysis of garcinol unveiled potent anticancer and anti-metastatic activity, with an IC50 ranging from 5.32 to 16.28 against Rh cell lines, as demonstrated by MTT assay. Garcinol actuates apoptosis by triggering mitotic arrest (G2/M phase arrest) in Rh cell lines and alters the expression of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins to trigger efficient apoptosis in cancer cells.",
    "Oncogenic Role of KIF18B Across Human Cancers: A Pan-Cancer Bioinformatic Analysis and Experimental Validation in Lung Adenocarcinoma.. Hou J, Shao X, Zhang Y, Jin F, Xu W, Xu X (2026). BACKGROUND: Identifying oncogenic drivers with broad relevance across multiple cancer types is critical for developing novel therapeutic strategies. Kinesin family member 18B (KIF18B) is involved in mitotic regulation, but its comprehensive role and clinical significance across human malignancies remain poorly understood. This study performed a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis of KIF18B and experimentally validated its role in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis using public databases to evaluate the expression profile, prognostic value, and potential biological functions of KIF18B across various human cancers. Based on these findings, LUAD was selected for further investigation. We evaluated KIF18B protein levels in LUAD cell lines (A549, HCC827, H1975) and compared them to a normal bronchial epithelial cell line (BEAS-2B). Subsequently, KIF18B was silenced in A549 cells using small interfering RNA (siRNA), and its effects on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were examined using colony formation, wound-healing, and Transwell assays. RESULTS: Our analysis across various cancers revealed that KIF18B is markedly overexpressed, including in LUAD, and this high expression correlates with poor prognosis in patients across different cancer types. In line with these bioinformatic results, our experiments confirmed that KIF18B protein levels were elevated in LUAD cell lines compared with normal controls. Functional assays demonstrated that knockdown of KIF18B in A549 cells significantly suppressed colony-forming ability and impaired migratory and invasive capacities. CONCLUSIONS: This study, integrating pan-cancer bioinformatic analysis with experimental validation, establishes KIF18B as a widely expressed oncogene with significant prognostic value. Our findings in LUAD confirm its crucial role in promoting key malignant phenotypes. Thus, KIF18B emerges as a valuable prognostic biomarker and a potential therapeutic target, not only for LUAD but potentially for a wider array of cancers.",
    "The role of PAQR3 in cancer progression - Molecular regulation, signaling pathways, and clinical implications: A review.. Lv Y, Li D, Ren XF, Guo Q, Ren QY (2026). Progesterone and adiponectin receptor 3 (PAQR3) is a Golgi-localized seven-transmembrane protein that anchors rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma kinase (Raf) and suppresses rat sarcoma/rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK) signaling, thereby influencing cellular proliferation, differentiation, and metastasis. This review aims to summarize the expression patterns, regulatory mechanisms, key downstream pathways, and clinical significance of PAQR3 in cancer. We synthesized findings from published clinical and experimental studies, including in vitro assays and nude mouse xenograft models, that evaluate PAQR3 expression, function, and signaling interactions across various tumor types. Overall, PAQR3 is frequently downregulated in many cancers, potentially due to promoter methylation, and low expression levels are associated with adverse clinicopathologic features and reduced survival. Functionally, PAQR3 overexpression inhibits proliferation, colony formation, migration, invasion, and tumor growth, primarily through the inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) pathways and modulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Additionally, PAQR3 is linked to nuclear factor kappa B/tumor protein p53 (NF-κB/p53), epidermal growth factor/beta-catenin (EGF/β-catenin) signaling, autophagy, and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2/ferroptosis (Nrf2/ferroptosis). These effects are modulated by upstream regulators, including microRNA-543 (miR-543), circular RNA 0043280/microRNA-203a-3p (circ_0043280/miR-203a-3p), microRNA-15b (miR-15b), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR), autophagy-related 7 (ATG7), and damage-specific DNA binding protein 2 (DDB2). In conclusion, PAQR3 functions as a tumor suppressor and holds potential as a prognostic biomarker. Targeting PAQR3-related pathways may provide new therapeutic opportunities.",
    "APG-1252 enhances the anticancer role of paclitaxel in non-small-cell lung cancer cells by suppressing the extracellular regulated protein kinases/myeloid cell leukemia 1 pathway.. Qian L, Guo Z, Cao X, Zhu H, Xu J, Chen X, Zong D, He X (2026). The efficacy of paclitaxel (PTX), an important chemotherapy drug in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, is limited by its resistance. APG-1252 has an inhibitory role in cancer and can inhibit myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL-1) to enhance chemotherapy drugs' antitumor effect. Therefore, this research further investigated whether APG-1252 could enhance the anticancer role of PTX by regulating MCL-1. NSCLC cells were treated with drugs. Cell viability was determined using the cell counting kit-8 assay. The cell apoptosis was examined using flow cytometry and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling staining. The abilities of cells to migrate, invade, and proliferate were examined using transwell and colony formation assays, as needed. The expression levels of extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK), phosphorylated ERK (p-ERK), and MCL-1 were quantified by Western blot. APG-1252 and PTX decreased the NSCLC cells' viability. APG-1252 and PTX induced cell apoptosis and inhibited the cells from migrating, proliferating, and invading. APG-1252 and PTX suppressed the expression of p-ERK and MCL-1. Besides, APG-1252 enhanced the anticancer role of PTX in NSCLC cells. Ro 67-7476, a p-ERK agonist, had an opposite role to the combination of APG-1252 with PTX in NSCLC cells. Additionally, Ro 67-7476 abolished the anticancer role of the combination of APG-1252 with PTX in the biological functions of NSCLC cells. APG-1252 enhanced the anticancer role of PTX in NSCLC cells by suppressing the ERK/MCL-1 pathway. This work provided the theoretical basis for the APG-1252 application.",
    "Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells from solid tissue and lipoaspirates: A comparative study of phenotype, growth, and secretome.. Dam PTM, Nguyen DD, Ngo ATT, Tran AM, Nguyen TT, Nguyen PV, Nguyen CQ, Nguyen ATT, Pham QT, Than UTT (2026). BACKGROUND: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are considered a promising therapy for various diseases due to their strong potential in regenerative medicine and immunomodulation. The tissue source of MSCs has gained attention for its role in influencing their function, accessibility, and readiness for clinical use. AIM: To identify the most suitable adipose source for MSC isolation and expansion for further applications. METHODS: We isolated MSCs from solid adipose tissue and liposuction aspirates using the enzyme method. The MSCs were examined for their expansion using population doubling time, differentiation capacity using multilineage differentiation induction, surface markers using flow cytometry, and stability of chromosomes using the karyotyping method. Growth factors and cytokines in MSC-conditioned media were analyzed using the Luminex assay. RESULTS: MSCs were isolated from solid adipose tissue and lipoaspirates and expanded from passage 0 to passage 2. All adipose-derived MSCs (AD-MSCs) exhibited the typical elongated, spindle-shaped morphology and comparable proliferation rate. They expressed positive surface markers [cluster of differentiation 73 (CD73): > 97%, CD90: > 98%, and CD105: > 95%], and negative markers (< 1%). All MSCs expressed similar levels of stemness genes (octamer-binding transcription factor 4, SRY-box 2, Krüppel-like factor, and MYC), colony-forming, and trilineage differentiation potential. Karyotyping analysis revealed normal chromosomal patterns in all samples, except one sample exhibiting a polymorphism (1qh+). Furthermore, the growth factors and cytokines of hepatocyte growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor A, interleukin 6 (IL-6), and IL-8 were detected in all AD-MSC conditioned media; but fibroblast growth factor-2 and keratinocyte growth factor were selectively expressed in conditioned media from solid or lipoaspirate AD-MSCs, respectively. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that AD-MSCs from both adipose sources possess all of the characteristic features of MSCs with source-specific secretome differences, which are suitable for further expansion and various clinical applications.",
    "Protein kinase C zeta promotes thyroid Cancer progression and represents a novel therapeutic target: evidence from specific atypical PKC inhibitor 2-acetyl-1,3-cyclopentanedione inhibitor studies.. Ding J, Fu R (2025). BACKGROUND: Poorly differentiated and anaplastic thyroid carcinomas represent aggressive malignancies with limited therapeutic options and poor prognosis. Protein kinase C zeta (PKCζ), an atypical PKC isozyme, has emerged as a critical regulator in various cancers, but its role in thyroid cancer progression remains largely unexplored. This study investigated PKCζ expression patterns in thyroid cancer and evaluated its therapeutic potential using the specific atypical PKC inhibitor 2-acetyl-1,3-cyclopentanedione (ACPD). METHODS: PKCζ expression and phosphorylation were analyzed in thyroid tissue samples from 20 patients and multiple thyroid cancer cell lines using Western blot analysis. Functional studies employed PKCζ overexpression, knockdown, and ACPD treatment in BCPAP (papillary) and 8505C (poorly differentiated) cell lines. Cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers were assessed. Therapeutic efficacy was evaluated in xenograft mouse models with ACPD treatment. RESULTS: PKCζ expression and phosphorylation progressively increased from normal thyroid tissue through papillary, poorly differentiated, to anaplastic thyroid carcinomas. ACPD treatment (5 μM) significantly suppressed malignant phenotypes in 8505C cells, including reduced proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion, while reversing EMT marker expression. PKCζ knockdown reproduced these anti-tumorigenic effects, confirming specificity. PKCζ overexpression in BCPAP cells enhanced malignant behaviors, which were effectively counteracted by ACPD treatment. In vivo studies demonstrated that ACPD treatment significantly reduced tumor growth in both cell line-derived xenograft models. CONCLUSION: PKCζ activation correlates with thyroid cancer aggressiveness and drives malignant progression through EMT regulation. ACPD effectively targets PKCζ-mediated oncogenic pathways, suggesting PKCζ inhibition as a promising therapeutic strategy for aggressive thyroid cancers.",
    "Development of short (CTAS-S) and very short (CTAS-VS) form of children's test anxiety scale using ant colony optimization.. Örs Özdil S, Koğar H, Kınay Çiçek E (2026). The aim of the present study was to develop short and very short forms of the Children's Test Anxiety Scale (CTAS) using the ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm. The item selection algorithm for the short form was applied to Sample 1 (N = 570), and the best-fitting short form was identified based on validity and reliability evidence. These analyses were then replicated with Sample 2 (N = 825) to confirm the findings. Children's Perceived Academic Self-Efficacy Scale used for convergent validity. Also measurement invariance tested by gender. Additionally, a very short form of the scale (CTAS-VS) was developed using a subset of the same sample. Across all three studies, consistent results were found in terms of model fit, factor structure and validity. Overall, findings suggest that both the 14-item short form (CTAS-S) and the 3-item very short form (CTAS-VS), developed via the ACO algorithm, possess strong psychometric properties.",
    "The synergistic tumor suppressor effect of CDK4/6 inhibitors and BRD4 inhibitors in acute myeloid leukemia.. Liao K, Guo C, Zhang M, Lv X, Yan J (2026). OBJECTIVE: The objective of this research is to explore the anti-leukemic properties of CDK4/6 inhibitors when used alongside BET inhibitors for treating acute myeloid leukemia (AML), as well as to clarify the molecular mechanisms involved. METHODS: Cell viability was assessed using the CCK-8 assay following treatment of AML cells with varying doses of SHR6390, a CDK4/6 inhibitor, and OTX015, a BET inhibitor.The time- and dose-dependent inhibitory effects of these two drugs on AML cells were assessed, and the respective IC50 and combination index (CI) values after co-treatment were calculated. The effects of SHR6390 and OTX015 on the growth potential of AML cells were additionally examined through soft agar colony formation assays and flow cytometry. Furthermore, RNA sequencing and Western blot analysis were conducted on cells treated with both drugs. The aim of this study is to explore the mechanism by which SHR6390 and OTX015 synergistically inhibit the proliferation of AML cells.The anti-tumor activity of SHR6390 and/or OTX015 in AML xenograft mice was also investigated through animal experiments. RESULTS: 1. Either the CDK4/6 inhibitor SHR6390 or the BRD4 inhibitor OTX015, or a combination of the two, were employed to hinder both the survival and proliferation of cell lines associated with acute myeloid leukemia, showing a synergistic effect. 2. The combined application of SHR6390 and OTX015 markedly suppresses the invasive and migratory capacities of acute myeloid leukemia cells.3. The use of both SHR6390 and OTX015 induces apoptosis in acute myeloid leukemia cells while also disrupting cell cycle progression, leading to a halt before DNA replication occurs. 4. SHR6390 and OTX015 hinder the proliferation of acute myeloid leukemia cells by targeting both the PI3K-AKT-mTOR and the Wnt-β-Catenin pathway. 5. SHR6390 and OTX015 Synergistically Inhibit the Growth of AML Xenografts In Vivo.",
    "Indocyanine green-activated photodynamic therapy with diode laser eradicates Enterococcus faecalis in infected root canals: An in vitro study.. Rfysh AF, Hameed MR, Asgary S, Shubbar M (2025). BACKGROUND: The current endodontic disinfection techniques may be supplemented with photodynamic therapy (PDT), which is believed to eliminate intracanal bacteria more efficiently. This in vitro study aimed to assess the antimicrobial effectiveness of PDT using various photosensitizers, in conjunction with a near-infrared diode laser (810 nm wavelength), in the root canals of teeth infected with Enterococcus faecalis. This research is crucial for determining the optimal PDT method for eliminating E. faecalis, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of endodontic disinfection techniques. MATERIALS AND ETHODS: This in vitro experimental study was conducted on 50 intact human maxillary first molars, which were decoronated, and palatal roots were instrumented to ISO size X5. After autoclaving, roots were inoculated with E. faecalis (ATCC 29212; 108 CFU/mL) and incubated anaerobically for 72 h. The roots were randomly divided into five experimental groups: control (C), laser alone (L), PDT with indocyanine green (ICG), PDT with methylene blue (MB), and PDT with cetrimide (CT) 2%. Root canals were flushed with phosphate-buffered saline, and serial dilutions were plated on agar. Colony-forming units were counted after 48-h incubation. Data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's post hoc test for pairwise comparisons. A significance level of P < 0.05 was considered. RESULTS: PDT with ICG resulted in complete eradication of E. faecalis (0 CFU/mL), whereas PDT with MB and CT produced significant reductions (5.08 ± 0.2 and 5.55 ± 0.1 log10 CFU/mL, respectively; P < 0.05). Laser alone reduced CFU/mL to 5.94 ± 0.07. CONCLUSION: PDT with ICG and an 810 nm diode laser achieved complete eradication of E. faecalis, outperforming MB, CT, and laser alone. These results advocate for ICG-PDT as a potent adjunct in endodontic disinfection protocols.",
    "Comparative evaluation of the antibacterial effect of ultraviolet radiation on alginate and condensation silicone impressions compared to hypochlorite.. Bajoghli F, Rostami FM, Gugunani H, Nazarifar AM (2025). BACKGROUND: Dental impressions are a known potential vector for cross-contamination between patients and the dental laboratory. Effective disinfection is, therefore, a critical step in infection control protocols. This in vitro study aimed to evaluate and compare the antibacterial efficacy of ultraviolet (UV) radiation and 0.525% sodium hypochlorite solution for disinfecting two common impression materials: condensation silicone and alginate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This in vitro study employed a comparative experimental design to evaluate disinfection efficacy. A total of 195 samples were utilized, comprising 90 discs each of condensation silicone and alginate, alongside positive and negative controls (n = 9 and n = 6, respectively). All samples were experimentally contaminated with standardized suspensions of three pathogenic species: Streptococcus pyogenes (beta-hemolytic Group A), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus. The disinfection protocols consisted of either exposure to 0.525% sodium hypochlorite spray for 10 min or treatment with UV radiation using a dedicated device (\"Fast Steril\"). Antibacterial efficacy was quantitatively assessed by enumerating the mean colony-forming units (CFUs) postdisinfection. Statistical analysis was performed using the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U-tests, with the significance level defined at α = 0.05. RESULTS: The analysis revealed a statistically significant difference in bacterial reduction based on the microbial species (P < 0.001). UV radiation demonstrated superior efficacy compared to sodium hypochlorite in disinfecting condensation silicone impressions (P < 0.05). Conversely, no significant difference was observed between the two disinfection methods for alginate impressions. Regarding bacterial susceptibility, the mean reduction in CFUs for S. pyogenes was significantly greater than for S. aureus and P. aeruginosa (P < 0.001), between which no significant difference was found (P = 1.0). CONCLUSION: Within the limitations of this study, UV radiation proved to be a more effective disinfection method for condensation silicone impressions than sodium hypochlorite spray. For alginate impressions, both methods were equally effective. Given its efficacy and the superior dimensional stability of UV-treated impressions reported in the literature, the adoption of UV radiation is recommended as a viable and efficient method for disinfecting both condensation silicone and alginate impressions, thereby mitigating the risk of cross-infection in dental practice.",
    "A case report of histiocytic sarcoma mimicking acute pericarditis.. Corianò M, Siviero N, Gasparetto N (2025). BACKGROUND: Pericardial masses are rare disease requiring incremental diagnostic workout to differentiate benignant from malignant lesions. No solid evidence exists regarding their management, and their treatment requires a case-by-case evaluation. CASE SUMMARY: A 54-year-old man was diagnosed with a pericardial mass. After performing cardiac magnetic resonance and computed tomography, a high suspicion of malignancy was raised. Positron emission tomography and pericardial biopsy confirmed the presence of a primary histiocytic sarcoma. After multidisciplinary evaluation, the mass was considered not suitable for surgical removal, and a neoadjuvant chemotherapy strategy was started. The first chemotherapy regimen-consisting of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, etoposide, vincristine, and methylprednisolone-was not effective. Therefore, a second, more aggressive, regimen consisting of cladribine, cytarabine, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, and mitoxantrone was started. Following the first cycle, the patient developed bone marrow aplasia and septic shock leading to the exitus. DISCUSSION: Histiocytic sarcomas primarily involving the heart are extremely rare. Surgical excision represents the first therapeutic choice when feasible. When not pursuable, a neoadjuvant therapy is preferred, although no consensus exists regarding the chemotherapy regimen.",
    "Age and QMP exposure affect the nutritional preferences of caged Apis mellifera worker honeybees.. Bracuti A, Hudson ZL, Pidcock EH, Yoon K, Duncan EJ (2026). UNLABELLED: Eusocial insect queens often use pheromones to prevent reproduction in the worker caste, enforcing the reproductive constraint that is central to eusociality. In A. mellifera honeybees, the queen emits several pheromones that affect worker reproduction, the most important being QMP. Although the effects of QMP have been studied in some detail, the mechanisms by which it brings about reproductive constraint in workers are still unclear. Remarkably, QMP is also able to repress reproduction in other insects, including the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, in which QMP has been shown to induce a starvation-like response. Here we use caged newly eclosed workers with an ad libitum choice of protein and sugar food sources to investigate whether QMP alters dietary intake in the honeybee. We show that initially, irrespective of QMP exposure, workers only consume protein, before shifting to carbohydrate after 4 days. We also show that QMP exposure results in an increased preference and intake of carbohydrates in worker bees, raising the possibility that QMP also induces a starvation-like response in honeybees. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13592-026-01246-8.",
    "The combination of rosuvastatin and meloxicam enhances the radiotherapy efficacy of MCF7, T-47D, and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines.. Naeimi A, Saedi HS, Bakhtiyari AM, Shabani K, Babajani Z, Zahmatkesh MH (2026). BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Radiotherapy is an essential treatment for breast cancer, but radioresistance remains a major obstacle. Studies suggest that statins and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors can enhance radiotherapy, yet few have examined their combined effects on breast cancer radiosensitivity. This study investigates the impact of meloxicam and rosuvastatin pretreatment on the radiosensitivity of MCF-7, T-47D, and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: MCF-7, T-47D, and MDA-MB-231 cells were pretreated with varying concentrations of meloxicam, rosuvastatin, or both. Their response to radiation was evaluated using micronucleus, clonogenic, catalase, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) assays to assess chromosomal damage, cell survival, oxidative stress (via hydrogen peroxide degradation), and SOD antioxidant enzyme activity, respectively. FINDINGS/RESULTS: Pretreatment with combined rosuvastatin (R) and meloxicam (M) at R2+M10 μM, R10+M50 μM, and R20+M100 μM increased genotoxicity and reduced colony formation across all irradiated cell lines compared to radiation alone. R10 μM, R10+M50 μM, and R20+M100 μM decreased catalase activity across irradiated cell lines compared to radiation alone, whereas R2+M10 μM decreased catalase activity significantly only in T-47D cells. Pretreatment with R10 μM, R2+M10 μM, R10+M50 μM, and R20+M100 μM reduced SOD activity in all irradiated cell lines compared to radiation alone. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: The combination of rosuvastatin and meloxicam at specific concentrations increased the radiation sensitivity of MCF-7, T-47D, and MDA-MB-231 cells. Combined pretreatment with rosuvastatin 10 μM and meloxicam 50 μM notably enhanced genotoxicity while reducing colony formation, catalase activity, and SOD activity compared to radiotherapy alone in MCF-7, T-47D, and MDA-MB-231 cell lines.",
    "Endothelial thrombomodulin-Its role in trauma-induced coagulopathy.. Abu-Hanna J, Morrow GB, Xu G, Timms L, Akbar N, Laffan M, Choudhury RP, Curry N (2026). BACKGROUND: Trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC) describes a complex set of coagulation changes affecting severely injured patients. The thrombomodulin-protein C axis is central to the evolution of TIC. Soluble thrombomodulin (sTM) levels are elevated after injury and predict poor clinical outcomes. Recently, a heritable bleeding disorder defined by injury-related excessive bleeding, markedly elevated sTM and a THBD mutation has been described. The clinical phenotype broadly mirrors that of trauma hemorrhage, and we hypothesized that their endothelial colony forming cells (ECFCs) could be used to model trauma-induced endothelial damage. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Our objectives were to: (a) define the hemostatic capacity of wild type (WT-) and THBD variant (MT-) ECFCs, using global hemostatic assays, (b) determine the hemostatic changes on ECFC surfaces after exposing cells to trauma stimuli, (c) evaluate the contributions of traumatized ECFCs and trauma patient plasma to overall hemostatic capacity, to better understand the injured endothelial-coagulation interface. RESULTS: We show that trauma stimuli cause significant, rapid shedding of TM from WT-cells and this reduced membrane-TM supports quicker fibrinolysis and greater thrombin generating capacity. Combining trauma plasma with traumatized ECFCs attenuates and/or negates these effects. CONCLUSION: This ECFC model provides novel mechanistic insights into TIC at the endothelial surface, informing future treatment strategies.",
    "The Potential Role of β-Asarone in Calcium Imbalance and Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Melanoma Cells.. Liu Y, Tang W, Yu B, Yang Q, Lai W (2026). BACKGROUND: The treatment landscape for melanoma, a particularly malignant skin cancer, is constrained by notable drug resistance and toxicity. β-Asarone, a natural compound from Acorus tatarinowii, has shown anticancer potential. Disruption of calcium homeostasis and mitochondrial dysfunction are key regulators of tumor cell survival and death. OBJECTIVE: This research was conducted to investigate the impact of β-Asarone on B16F10 melanoma cells, focusing on its potential to induce apoptosis by modulating calcium signaling and mitochondrial function. METHODS: Cell proliferation and apoptosis were evaluated using CCK-8, colony formation, EdU, and TUNEL assays. Intracellular calcium levels and mitochondrial membrane potential were measured using Fluo-4 AM, Rhod-2 AM, and JC-1 staining. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels were assessed by fluorescent probes and ATP assay. Western blotting was utilized to detect apoptosis-related proteins, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway activation, and mitochondrial dynamics (OPA1, DRP1, FIS1). RESULTS: Treatment with β-Asarone notably inhibited the proliferation of B16F10 cells while simultaneously inducing apoptosis. Fluorescent probe analysis revealed that β-Asarone triggered cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca²⁺ overloaded in both the cytosol and mitochondria, accompanied by decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, elevated ROS levels, and reduced ATP production. Western blot analysis showed increased expression of DRP1 and FIS1, decreased OPA1, and enhanced AMPK phosphorylation, indicating that β-Asarone promotes mitochondrial fission through AMPK activation, likely driven by intracellular calcium imbalance. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that β-Asarone induces apoptosis in B16F10 melanoma cells by triggering Ca²⁺ overload and mitochondrial dysfunction.",
    "The SMAD-Pathway Mediates HMGB1-Induced Proliferation and Metastatic Progression in Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma Cells.. Lian DD, Li XM, Jia YX, Zhou MW, Chen XR, Tian YY, Li M, Sun MH, Zhao Y, Li HJ, Zhang QL (2026). BACKGROUND: High-mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1) is a chromatin-binding protein involved in arthritis, ischemia, sepsis, atherosclerosis, neurodegenerative disorders, meningitis, and cancer. HMGB1 exhibits dual roles in cancer, acting as either a tumor suppressor or oncoprotein depending on context. OBJECTIVE: This research aimed to elucidate HMGB1's functional significance in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC). METHODS: We overexpressed HMGB1 in cSCC cell lines using recombinant adenovirus and examined its effects on cell proliferation, colony formation, and cell migration. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical analysis revealed elevated HMGB1 expression levels in cSCC tissue relative to normal epidermis. To assess the influence of HMGB1, we employed recombinant adenoviruses expressing HMGB1 to transduce SCC cell lines (SCC12 and SCC13). Enhanced HMGB1 expression significantly promoted cellular proliferation and colony formation capacity. Notably, HMGB1 overexpression elevated the levels of proliferation regulators, including P63, SOX2, CDK4 and CDK6. Furthermore, HMGB1 overexpression substantially enhanced tumor invasiveness, accompanied by upregulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) biomarkers. Mechanistically, overexpression of HMGB1 enhanced transforming growth factor-β signaling by increasing phosphorylation of SMAD2/3, the key mediators of EMT. CONCLUSION: These data imply that HMGB1 acts as a tumor-promoting factor in cSCC.",
    "Glutamine transporter SLC1A5 inhibits autophagy-mediated CD276 degradation to promote esophageal cancer progression.. Wang C, Zhang H, Guan C, Li Y, Yang S, Huang L (2026). BACKGROUND: CD276/B7-H3 is an immune checkpoint molecule often overexpressed in cancers, representing a potential therapeutic target. The underlying mechanisms for CD276 upregulation remain unclear. This study investigates how glutamine metabolism affects CD276 protein stability and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) progression. METHODS: CD276 and SLC1A5 expression were analyzed in 90 ESCC clinical tissues and TCGA/GEO datasets. CCK-8, colony formation, wound healing and transwell assays were performed in KYSE150 and KYSE450 cells. Autophagy was quantified by immunofluorescence and western blot. Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels measured by flow cytometry. Rescue experiments used N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and chloroquine (CQ). Finally, antitumor effects of SLC1A5 inhibitor V9302 in the presence or absence of CD276 were evaluated in NOD/SCID mice (n = 5 per group) bearing KYSE150 xenografts. RESULTS: CD276 and SLC1A5 upregulated in ESCC tissues (P < 0.05). CD276 overexpression enhanced ESCC cell proliferation and migration by 42.3% and 58.7%, respectively (P < 0.01). CQ but not MG-132 increased CD276 expression in ESCC cells. SLC1A5 stabilized CD276 protein without altering CD276 mRNA levels, by suppressing ROS-dependent autophagic degradation. NAC reversed ROS-induced CD276 degradation, while CQ abrogated CD276 downregulation upon glutamine metabolism inhibition. Inhibiting glutamine metabolism could reverse ESCC cell proliferation induced by CD276 overexpression. Moreover, combination of V9302 and CD276 knockout significantly reduced KYSE150 cell-derived xenograft tumor volume by 65.2% (95% CI 58.3-72.1%, P < 0.001) in NOD/SCID mice, without affecting mouse body weight (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: SLC1A5 enhances CD276 stability by suppressing ROS-autophagy signaling, promoting ESCC progression. Targeting glutamine metabolism to enhance CD276 degradation might be a novel therapeutic strategy for ESCC.",
    "Deubiquitinase USP15 restricts LC3-dependent targeting of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.. Rahlwes KC, Campos PC, Dias BRS, Párraga Solórzano PK, Shiloh MU (2026). Macroautophagy/autophagy enables macrophages to degrade intracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), and this defense depends on E3 ubiquitin ligases such as PRKN/PARKIN/PARK2 and SMURF1, which tag Mtb-associated structures for lysosomal clearance. Deubiquitinases (DUBs) counter ubiquitin ligases by removing ubiquitin from molecular targets. We hypothesized that DUBs might offset ubiquitin ligase activity and negatively regulate host immunity to Mtb. Here, we identify USP15 (ubiquitin specific peptidase 15) as a negative regulator of MAP1LC3/LC3-dependent targeting pathways (consistent with xenophagy or CASM/LAP-related ATG8ylation) that mediate macrophage immunity to Mtb. Using a targeted knockdown screen in mouse macrophages, we found that Usp15 loss increased K63-linked ubiquitination and LC3 recruitment to Mtb-associated structures, leading to reduced bacterial replication. These effects required USP15's catalytic activity and were reversed by knockdown of PRKN or inhibition of autophagy initiation. In primary human macrophages, USP15 knockdown similarly enhanced LC3 targeting and restricted Mtb growth. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of USP15 with a selective small molecule decreased Mtb burden in human macrophages. Our findings identify USP15 as a suppressor of macrophage immunity and suggest that targeting deubiquitinases may represent a promising host-directed therapeutic strategy against tuberculosis.Abbreviations: CFU: colony-forming unit; DUBs: deubiquitinases; K48-Ub: K48-linked ubiquitin; K63-Ub: K63-linked ubiquitin; Mtb-pLux: luminescent Mtb strain Mtb; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; MOI: multiplicity of infection; NTC: non-targeting control; TB: tuberculosis.",
    "Addressing loneliness by AI chatbot: a qualitative study of empty-nest elderly.. Jiao F, Li M, Liu M, Zhang Q (2026). BACKGROUND: Loneliness among empty-nest older adults is a growing public health concern with complex psychosocial consequences. AI chatbots are increasingly integrated into daily life, yet little is known about how empty-nest older adults incorporate these agents into their daily interactions to address loneliness. OBJECTIVES: This study examines how empty-nest older adults engage with AI chatbots in routine communication to mitigate loneliness, emphasizing patterns of engagement rather than assessing effectiveness. METHODS: Semistructured interviews were conducted to collect data. A total of 18 participants were included in this study. Interview transcriptions were coded and analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Participants engaged with the chatbot as a versatile communicative resource that provided a safe outlet for self-expression and narrative voice, fostered experiences of emotional care and empathy, and enabled cognitively and emotionally stimulating recreational interactions. It also supported imaginative role-playing that restored agency and social scripts, served as a source of informal counseling, and facilitated reconnection with both offline and online social networks. Together, these modes represented diverse, experience-based strategies through which the chatbot was woven into daily efforts to manage loneliness. CONCLUSIONS: The findings advance conceptualizations of gerontechnology as a communicative practice and suggest that policy, design, and service frameworks should treat AI companions as socially embedded tools requiring ethical, accessible, and context-sensitive integration. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable.",
    "Cholinergic modulation of dopamine release drives effortful behaviour.. Touponse GC, Pomrenze MB, Yassine T, Denomme N, Wang M, Mehta V, Zhang Z, Malenka RC, Eshel N (2026). Effort is costly: given a choice, we tend to avoid it1. However, in many cases, effort adds value to the ensuing rewards2. From ants3 to humans4, individuals prefer rewards that had been harder to achieve. This counterintuitive process may promote reward seeking even in resource-poor environments, thus enhancing evolutionary fitness5. Despite its ubiquity, the neural mechanisms supporting this behavioural effect are poorly understood. Here we show that effort amplifies the dopamine response to an otherwise identical reward, and this amplification depends on local modulation of dopamine axons by acetylcholine. High-effort rewards evoke rapid acetylcholine release from local interneurons in the nucleus accumbens. Acetylcholine then binds to nicotinic receptors on dopamine axon terminals to augment dopamine release when reward is delivered. Blocking the cholinergic modulation blunts dopamine release selectively in high-effort contexts, impairing effortful behaviour while leaving low-effort reward consumption intact. These results reconcile in vitro studies, which have long demonstrated that acetylcholine can trigger dopamine release directly through dopamine axons6-11, with in vivo studies that failed to observe such modulation12-14, but did not examine high-effort contexts. Our findings uncover a mechanism that drives effortful behaviour through context-dependent local interactions between acetylcholine and dopamine axons.",
    "First Record of the Gall-Inducing Insect Ophelimus mediterraneus Borowiec & Burks (Hymenoptera, Chalcidoidea, Eulophidae) in Eucalyptus from America, Including the First Report of Male Specimens.. Buyatti RA, Hernández CM, Aquino DA, López SN, Gonzalez AM, Berretta MF (2026). The invasive eucalyptus gall wasp Ophelimus mediterraneus Borowiec & Burks (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) is reported for the first time in Argentina and the Americas, representing a new record on Eucalyptus benthamii, E. viminalis, and E. cinerea, thereby expanding its known host range. Species identification was supported by molecular analyses (mitochondrial COI and nuclear 28S gene sequences), adult morphology, and morpho-anatomical examination of the induced galls. The galls are small, circular to slightly ellipsoid protrusions usually located on one side of the leaf blade. Mature galls measure approximately 0.8-1.2 mm in diameter and contain a single larval chamber. They are monothalamous, with a central chamber lined with nutritive tissue and surrounded by a sclerenchymatic layer. Additionally, this study provides the first description of the male O. mediterraneus, including detailed morphological traits, biological observations, and illustrative images. Males were consistently present in all samples collected, suggesting that O. mediterraneus may reproduce sexually under certain environmental or ecological conditions. These findings highlight the urgent need to monitor the potential spread and impact of this exotic gall-inducing pest on regional eucalyptus plantations and emphasize the importance of integrating both morphological and molecular tools for accurate detection and assessment.",
    "High-resolution in situ imaging reveals size-specific moonlight responses in zooplankton diel vertical migration.. Dickerson AL, Jechow A, Nößler M, Walles TJW, Berger SA, Hölker F, Nejstgaard JC (2026). Light is the primary cue driving zooplankton diel vertical migration (DVM), a strategy that balances predation risk with resource access. However, DVM is often oversimplified, with limited consideration of how light-driven risks and resource needs vary across taxa and life stages. This simplification is partly due to constraints on collecting high-resolution, size-resolved data -especially at night, when subtle shifts in illumination reshape nocturnal risk landscapes. To overcome these limitations, we deployed a high-resolution in situ modular Deep-focus Plankton Imager and an image-recognition approach to quantify fine scale DVM and body sizes of Cladocerans and Copepods in Lake Stechlin, Germany. Data was collected from day into night and across moonrise and was compared with environmental data from vertical profiling sondes. Typical DVM patterns emerged, with deeper daytime distributions, however, moonlight introduced additional behavioural complexity: larger individuals avoided illuminated layers, likely managing predation risk, while smaller individuals moved into these layers, possibly exploiting foraging opportunities and reduced risk. These light-mediated shifts were further shaped by ecological conditions; copepods tracked food-rich layers regardless of light levels at night, while cladocerans showed light-dependent responses to both temperature and food, such that light caused them to avoid otherwise favourable (warm, food-rich) layers. Our approach provides new insight into how zooplankton navigate nocturnal lightscapes, revealing size- and taxon-specific strategies. By establishing size-dependent responses to natural moonlight, this work provides a crucial baseline for predicting how artificial light at night may restructure zooplankton communities and destabilize freshwater food webs.",
    "Human approach-avoidance conflict behaviour relates to transdiagnostic psychiatric symptom dimensions.. Sporrer JK, Melinscak F, Bach DR (2026). Approach-avoidance conflict (AAC), a laboratory representation of risky foraging, serves as mainstay of pre-clinical anxiety disorder research, motivated by an impact of anxiolytic drugs on cautious behaviour. While cautiousness appears to be a stable behavioural trait, growing evidence suggests that it is not strongly related to self-reported anxiety. Here, we ask more broadly which psychiatric symptom dimensions relate to AAC behaviour, using a cross-sectional, data-driven, exploration-confirmation approach across two large online samples (N1 = 315; N2 = 690). In a previously validated task, participants chose whether, and when, to approach rewards under varying threat probability and magnitude. They then completed a comprehensive psychiatric questionnaire battery with a known three-factor structure. A broad psychopathology factor, mainly related to impulsivity and OCD symptoms and not specifically linked with anxiety, showed the strongest relation to all behavioural readouts. Higher symptom scores related to decreased passive avoidance, increased behavioural inhibition, and reduced sensitivity to threat features. This factor was also associated with an altered subjective model of threat and reward relations in the environment. Broad and unspecific associations with same directional patterns but smaller magnitudes were found between individual questionnaire scores and behaviour, underscoring the status of transdiagnostic dimensions. Crucially, no associations were found between behaviour and transdiagnostic anxiety-depression, or with gender. This study highlights that cautiousness in AAC tasks is comprised of two components, which are independently associated with transdiagnostic psychopathology but not specifically or particularly strongly with self-reported trait anxiety. Our cross-sectional findings underline the complex interplay of behavioural predispositions and psychopathology.",
    "Complex Behaviors in Termites: Mechanisms and Evolution.. Zhou X, Merchant A, Sun Q (2026). Termites are among the most abundant terrestrial organisms on the planet and form one of the two largest eusocial groups alongside the holometabolous, haplodiploid Hymenoptera. Having evolved from cockroaches 150 million years ago, termites exhibit unique social behaviors, in part influenced by their hemimetabolous, diploid nature. Research on termite behavior has historically been limited by their cryptic lifestyles, among other factors. However, the recent decade has seen notable progress in the field of termite behavioral research, in part due to a greater awareness of basic termite biology. Here, we review the current understanding of various areas of termite behavior, including hygiene, foraging, and vibroacoustic communication. Where relevant, we draw comparisons with other eusocial lineages, highlighting how differences in evolutionary history may lead to either convergent or divergent solutions to similar challenges.",
    "Comparative (1)H NMR Metabolomics Between Scandinavian Propolis and Australian Propolis: The Quest to Identify Radical Scavenging Compounds.. Vind J, Engelsen SB, Jørgensen HM, Antvorskov JC, Josefsen K, Aru V (2026). Propolis from Apis mellifera and cerumen from Tetragonula carbonaria are complex mixtures of beeswax, plant resins, and bee secretions whose composition varies with geography and species. Understanding these differences is important for exploring their bioactive potential. This study employs untargeted quantitative 1H NMR metabolomics to characterize A. mellifera propolis from Scandinavia (Denmark and Norway) and Australia, as well as cerumen from T. carbonaria in Australia. Hydrophilic and hydrophobic extracts were analyzed to assess compositional differences across geographical origin and bee species, and to link specific metabolites to radical scavenging activity (RSA). Principal component analysis (PCA) of the 1H NMR spectra showed a marked separation between Scandinavian and Australian propolis. Hydrophilic extracts showed that Scandinavian propolis contains higher levels of aromatic compounds, whereas Australian propolis is richer in carbohydrates. In contrast, cerumen from T. carbonaria exhibits higher amounts of terpenoids. Hydrophobic extracts revealed that Australian propolis has the highest wax content, with shorter chains and more free fatty acids, while Scandinavian propolis samples display uniform wax structures and the highest aromatic content. Multivariate regression using recursive weighted partial least squares (rPLS) to RSA prediction highlighted signals attributable to ferulic acid and p-coumaric acid, which were confirmed by statistical total correlation spectroscopy (STOCSY). These findings demonstrate the utility of quantitative 1H NMR metabolomics for distinguishing botanical and geographic chemotypes of propolis and cerumen. The findings further show that Scandinavian propolis is more consistent with respect to metabolite composition compared to Australian samples, presumably reflecting differences in resin sources for foraging.",
    "A multilayered Zn/CuSe/Zn heterostructural composite for orthopedic implants: Notable work-hardening, antibacterial, and antitumor properties.. Zhang M, Dai Y, Tan C, Guo L, Lin J, Li Y, Zhang D, Wen C (2026). Building on the well-established antitumor properties of selenium (Se), the incorporation of Se into zinc (Zn)-based composites holds substantial potential for antitumor implant applications. Nevertheless, the pronounced disparity in melting points between Zn and Se renders conventional direct smelting methods impractical for fabricating Zn-Se composites. Furthermore, the prevalent work-softening tendency of Zn-based materials constitutes a major barrier to their clinical translation. Here, we report an effective strategy in which Zn sheets coated with copper selenide (CuSe) powder were used as precursors to fabricate multilayered Zn/CuSe/Zn heterostructural composites through the accumulative roll bonding (ARB) technique, providing a promising approach to overcoming processing challenges. The microstructure of the Zn/CuSe/Zn composite primarily consisted of the η-Zn phase, accompanied by ε-CuZn5 and ZnSe intermetallic compounds. After 14 ARB passes and subsequent annealing treatment, the composite evidenced 246 ± 2 MPa for yield strength, 262 ± 3 MPa for ultimate tensile strength, and 12.2 ± 0.3% for elongation, along with noticeable strain hardening during tensile deformation. The Zn/CuSe/Zn composite samples exhibited a moderate corrosion rate of 60.23 ± 0.26 μm/year in electrochemical testing and a degradation rate of 38.12 ± 3.01 μm/year in Hanks' solution. Although some differences exist between the two results, the overall trend is consistent. The composite displayed strong antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), evidenced by an inhibition zone diameter of 3.21 ± 0.01 mm and colony-forming unit count of 42 ± 6. Furthermore, the composite exhibited favorable biocompatibility with MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells while exerting pronounced growth-inhibiting effects on MG63 osteosarcoma (tumor) cells. The Zn/CuSe/Zn composite demonstrates strong potential for antitumor implant therapy due to its potent overall combination of properties relating to mechanical characteristics, degradation capability, and biofunctionality. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This work reports the fabrication of multilayered Zn/CuSe/Zn heterostructural composites via the accumulative roll bonding (ARB) technique which exhibit notable biocompatibility, bone-regenerating properties, as well as antibacterial and antitumor capabilities. After 14 ARB cycles followed by annealing treatment, the Zn/CuSe/Zn composite material demonstrated significant work-hardening behavior, achieving a yield strength of ∼246 MPa, an ultimate tensile strength of ∼262 MPa, an elongation of ∼12.2%, and a moderate degradation rate of 38.12 ± 3.01 μm/year. Furthermore, the composite exhibited pronounced antibacterial activity against S. aureus, promoted osteogenic differentiation in pre-osteogenic MC3T3-E1 cells, and displayed remarkable antitumor efficacy against MG63 osteosarcoma cells. Owing to its suitable mechanical performance and multifunctional biological properties, this multilayered Zn/CuSe/Zn heterostructural composite holds considerable promise for orthopedic applications.",
    "Targeting geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase suppresses interleukin-1β-driven proliferation in lung squamous cell carcinoma by inhibiting Ras homolog family member A and Rac family small GTPase 1 geranylgeranylation.. Li L, Zhao X, Liang D, Zhai W, Xu D, Dai S, Wang J (2026). Lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) has a scarcity of actionable therapeutic targets. Through integrative multi-omics analysis combining Mendelian randomization and colocalization of LUSC genome-wide association studies with functional quantitative trait loci, we identified the enzyme GGPPS as a causal driver with robust genetic support (PP·H4 = 74.1%) and showed that its elevated expression predicted reduced survival and accelerated tumor progression. Functional interrogation demonstrated that GGPS1 knockdown potently suppressed proliferation in vitro (CCK-8, EdU and colony formation) and in vivo (xenografts studies). Mechanistically, GGPPS drives oncogenesis through its catalytic activity in mediating protein geranylgeranylation: geranylgeranylated RHOA activated ROCK1-dependent phosphorylation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB to induce transcription of IL1B, whereas geranylgeranylated RAC1 promoted STAT1 nuclear translocation for direct IL1RAP transactivation. Critically, pharmacological inhibition abolished GGPPS-driven geranylgeranylation-dependent signaling: JSH-23 reversed both the proliferation mediated by RHOA and NF-κB p65 and the upregulation of IL1B potentiated by GGPS1 overexpression; and NSC23766 blocked the RAC1/STAT1-dependent IL1RAP activation amplified by GGPPS elevation, confirming that both axes are indispensable for GGPPS-dependent proliferation. Collectively, this GGPPS-mediated geranylgeranylation axis, converging on IL-1 pathway amplification, represents a central therapeutic vulnerability in LUSC, highlighting GGPPS as a promising macromolecular target for this recalcitrant malignancy.",
    "Circ_0075691 regulates lipid metabolism in granulosa cells by interacting with EIF4A3 to promote PTGS2 mRNA stability.. Huang P, Cai J, Chen G, Xu H, Chen S, Li H, Fu Y, Zheng B, Zhang Z (2026). BACKGROUND: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are implicated in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), yet their roles in granulosa cell dysfunction remain unclear. This study explores the mechanistic role of circ_0075691 in PCOS-associated metabolic dysregulation. METHODS: The circular structure of circ_0075691 was confirmed through gel electrophoresis and RNase R resistance assays. Its expression levels and subcellular localization were assessed using RT-PCR and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Subsequent to the overexpression of circ_0075691, the cell function assays were conducted, including CCK-8, colony formation, flow cytometry, and analyses of oxidative stress and lipid metabolism-related indicators. Bioinformatics analyses were employed to predict RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that potentially interact with circ_0075691, and these interactions were validated using RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and RNA pulldown assays. RESULTS: Circ_0075691 was verified to possess a circular structure and was predominantly localized in the nucleus. Its expression was significantly elevated in both follicular fluid (FF) and granulosa cells from PCOS patients compared to normal controls. In vitro experiments demonstrated that overexpression of circ_0075691 led to reduced cell viability and proliferation, decreased oxygen consumption rate (OCR), and increased apoptosis, oxidative stress, and lipid accumulation. Mechanistically, circ_0075691 was found to interact with and stabilize the EIF4A3 protein, thereby enhancing the stability of PTGS2 mRNA. Silencing PTGS2 mitigated the metabolic and apoptotic abnormalities induced by circ_0075691. CONCLUSION: This study revealed that circ_0075691 played a crucial role in PCOS-related granulosa cell functions and lipid metabolism. The circ_0075691/EIF4A3/PTGS2 axis provided new insights into the molecular mechanism of PCOS and potential therapeutic targets."
