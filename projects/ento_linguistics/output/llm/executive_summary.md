## Overview

This research investigates the critical role of language – specifically, Ento-Linguistic domains – in shaping scientific communication and understanding within entomology. The study examines how the use of terminology, often influenced by human social structures, creates ambiguity, assumptions, and potentially inappropriate framings within ant biology research. Through a mixed-methodology approach combining computational text analysis with theoretical discourse examination, the research aims to reveal the constitutive nature of scientific language and provide actionable recommendations for clearer communication across the discipline.

## Key Contributions

This manuscript makes several significant contributions to the field of scientific discourse analysis and entomology. Firstly, it establishes a novel Ento-Linguistic framework, defining six key domains – Unit of Individuality, Behavior and Identity, Power & Labor, Sex & Reproduction, Kin, and Economics – to systematically analyze the influence of terminology. Secondly, the research demonstrates a high degree of context-dependence in entomological terminology, with 73.4% of analyzed terms exhibiting variable meanings depending on the research context.  Crucially, the study identifies pervasive anthropomorphic framing (67.3%) derived from human social hierarchies, particularly within the Power & Labor domain, highlighting how this influences research questions and interpretations.  Furthermore, the research provides a robust methodology for combining computational text analysis with theoretical discourse examination, offering a replicable framework for investigating the constitutive role of language in scientific knowledge production. Finally, the manuscript delivers practical recommendations for improving scientific communication, advocating for greater terminological awareness and a critical examination of underlying assumptions.

## Methodology Summary

The research employs a mixed-methodology framework combining computational text analysis with theoretical discourse examination. The computational component utilizes a multi-stage text processing pipeline – tokenization, lemmatization, and term extraction – to identify and categorize Ento-Linguistic terms from a curated corpus of 2,847 scientific publications.  Network analysis is then performed to map terminology relationships, revealing structural patterns and clustering.  The theoretical component employs conceptual mapping to examine how terminology shapes research questions and methodological choices.  This approach integrates quantitative pattern detection with qualitative conceptual analysis, ensuring both empirical rigor and theoretical depth.

## Principal Results

Analysis of the entomological literature revealed significant patterns in terminology use. The study identified 1,578 terms across six Ento-Linguistic domains, demonstrating a high degree of interconnectedness within the terminology network. Notably, 73.4% of terms exhibited context-dependent meanings, with the Power & Labor domain displaying the highest variability (4.2 contexts per term).  Furthermore, 89.2% of terms within the Power & Labor domain originated from hierarchical human social structures, reflecting a pervasive anthropomorphic framing. The network analysis revealed strong clustering around conceptual domains, with a modularity coefficient of 0.67. The research also identified key ambiguities, such as the multi-scale implications of “individuality” and the potential for misinterpretation arising from terms like “caste” and “queen.”

## Significance and Impact

This research has significant implications for both entomology and broader scientific communication practices. By demonstrating the constitutive role of language in shaping scientific understanding, the study challenges the assumption that scientific knowledge is a neutral representation of reality. The findings highlight the importance of terminological awareness and the need for researchers to critically examine the underlying assumptions embedded in scientific language. The established Ento-Linguistic framework offers a valuable tool for analyzing scientific discourse across disciplines, promoting clearer communication and reducing ambiguity.  Ultimately, this work contributes to a more reflexive and ethically responsible approach to scientific inquiry, fostering greater collaboration and understanding within and beyond the field of entomology.
