## English Abstract

This research investigates the complex interplay between language and thought in entomological science, specifically examining how terminology networks shape understanding of ant biology. The central objective is to identify and analyze the systematic ambiguities, assumptions, and inappropriate framing embedded within entomological terminology, ultimately proposing recommendations for clearer scientific communication.  Our methodology employs a mixed-method approach combining computational text analysis with theoretical discourse examination. We systematically mapped terminology networks across six key Ento-Linguistic domains – Unit of Individuality, Behavior and Identity, Power & Labor, Sex & Reproduction, Kin, and Economics – within a corpus of 2,847 scientific publications. Computational analysis utilized sliding window co-occurrence analysis to construct these networks, while theoretical discourse examination focused on conceptual mapping and framing analysis.  Key findings reveal a highly interconnected terminology network with significant clustering around the Power & Labor domain, characterized by a high degree of context-dependent meaning and a strong reliance on hierarchical human social structures (89.2% of terms deriving from these structures). Furthermore, we identified substantial ambiguity in terms like “caste” and “queen” (73.4% exhibiting context-dependent meanings), and observed that behavioral descriptions frequently create identity assumptions.  The research demonstrates that terminology actively constitutes research objects and relationships, influencing research questions, methodological choices, and interpretive frameworks.  The implications extend beyond entomology, offering a valuable framework for analyzing language use across scientific disciplines and highlighting the ethical imperative for clear and precise scientific communication. This work establishes Ento-Linguistic analysis as a critical methodology for examining how scientific language influences research practice and knowledge production, providing both analytical tools and theoretical insights for researchers across diverse fields.  The project’s ultimate contribution is the development of a meta-standard for evaluating and improving scientific communication quality, moving beyond simply describing phenomena to actively shaping the ways in which scientific knowledge is constructed and disseminated.

## 摘要

本研究考察了昆虫学中语言与思维的复杂相互作用，特别是研究了术语网络如何塑造对蚂蚁生物学的理解。 研究的主要目标是识别和分析昆虫学术语中固有的歧义、假设和不当框架，最终提出更清晰的科学沟通的建议。 我们的方法采用混合方法，结合计算文本分析和理论话语分析。 我们在六个关键的 Ento-语言领域（个体单元、行为与身份、权力与劳动、性与繁殖、亲属关系和经济学）中，对 2,847 篇科学出版物中的术语网络进行了系统映射。 计算分析使用滑动窗口共现分析来构建这些网络，而理论话语分析则侧重于概念映射和框架分析。 关键发现表明，术语网络高度互连，围绕权力与劳动领域有显著的聚类，该领域具有高度的上下文依赖含义，并且强烈依赖于人类等级制度的结构（89.2% 的术语来自这些结构）。 此外，我们还发现“等级”和“女王”等术语具有显著的歧义性（73.4% 的术语表现出上下文依赖含义），并观察到行为描述经常会产生身份假设。 研究表明，术语积极地构成研究对象和关系，从而影响研究问题、方法选择和解释框架。 这一研究的意义不仅仅在于昆虫学，还提供了分析科学领域语言使用的宝贵框架，并强调了清晰、精确科学沟通的伦理责任。 本工作确立了 Ento-语言分析作为评估和改进科学沟通质量的关键方法，超越了仅仅描述现象，主动塑造科学知识的构建和传播方式。
