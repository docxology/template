# LLM Review Settings (optional)
# Controls LLM-powered manuscript review features
llm:
  translations:
    # Enable/disable translation generation during LLM review
    enabled: true  # Set to false to disable translation generation
    
    # List of target languages for technical abstract translation
    # Supported languages: zh (Chinese Simplified), hi (Hindi), ru (Russian)
    languages:
      - zh  # Chinese (Simplified)
      - hi  # Hindi
      - ru  # Russian
    
    # Note: Translations generate a 200-400 word technical abstract in English,
    # then translate it to each configured language. Each translation is saved
    # as a separate file (e.g., translation_zh.md) in output/llm/

# Testing Configuration (optional)
# Maximum acceptable test failures before halting pipeline
# Priority: Environment variables > Config file > Default (0)
# Environment variables (MAX_TEST_FAILURES, MAX_INFRA_TEST_FAILURES, MAX_PROJECT_TEST_FAILURES)
# take precedence over config file values
testing:
  # General maximum acceptable test failures (default: 0 = strict, no failures allowed)
  max_test_failures: 0
  
  # Infrastructure test suite maximum (default: 0)
  max_infra_test_failures: 0
  
  # Project test suite maximum (default: 0)
  max_project_test_failures: 0
  
  # Usage examples:
  # - Development: Set to 3-5 to allow some failures while working on features
  # - CI/CD: Set to 0 for strict validation (recommended for production)
  # - Migration: Set higher during test suite refactoring

# Notes:
# - Environment variables (AUTHOR_NAME, PROJECT_TITLE, etc.) will override
#   values in this file if set
# - Empty strings use defaults or are auto-generated
# - Multiple authors are supported - add entries to the authors list
# - The config file is version-controllable and can be committed to git
