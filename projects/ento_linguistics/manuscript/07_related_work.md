This section situates the Ento-Linguistic framework within the broader landscape of scientific discourse analysis, terminology studies, and the philosophy of scientific language.

## Critical Discourse Analysis and Science Studies

The tradition of critical discourse analysis (CDA), as formalized by \citet{fairclough1992} and extended by \citet{wodak2009methods}, provides the methodological foundation for examining how language structures power relations and institutional knowledge. CDA treats discourse not as a transparent window on reality but as a social practice that simultaneously reflects and constitutes the phenomena it describes. Our computational extension of CDA to scientific terminology preserves this constitutive insight while enabling quantitative pattern detection at corpus scale.

Within the sociology of scientific knowledge (SSK), \citet{latour1987} demonstrated how scientific facts are constructed through networks of human actors, instruments, and inscriptions—of which terminology is a central component. \citet{hacking1999social} refined the constructionist position by distinguishing between the social construction of *ideas* about natural kinds and the construction of the kinds themselves, a distinction directly relevant to entomological terminology: the term "caste" constructs a framework for understanding ant social organization, but the behavioural phenotypes it labels are empirically real. Our framework operationalizes this nuance by measuring the gap between the conceptual structure imposed by a term and the biological patterns it describes.

\citeauthor{kuhn1996}'s \citeyearpar{kuhn1996} analysis of paradigm shifts highlighted how shared vocabulary both enables and constrains scientific communities. The terminology networks we construct (Section \ref{sec:experimental_results}) provide empirical evidence for Kuhnian incommensurability at the linguistic level: domain-specific vocabulary clusters resist integration, and paradigm-bridging terms carry high ambiguity precisely because they must reconcile incompatible conceptual frameworks. \citeauthor{wheeler1911}'s \citeyearpar{wheeler1911} early framing of the ant colony as an "organism" exemplifies this process—a metaphor that organized a century of research while simultaneously constraining how individuality was conceptualized in social insect biology.

## Feminist and Postcolonial Epistemology

Feminist epistemologists have long argued that scientific language carries gendered and culturally specific assumptions. \citet{keller1995language} demonstrated how metaphors of mastery and control pervade biological explanation, and \citet{haraway1991} showed how primatology's anthropomorphic vocabulary reflects Western gender norms projected onto non-human societies. \citet{longino1990} argued that the objectivity of science depends on critical community scrutiny of precisely the kind of background assumptions that terminology encodes.

Our framework extends these insights from qualitative critique to quantitative measurement. The framing prevalence analysis (Table \ref{tab:framing_analysis}) provides empirical evidence for the anthropomorphic and hierarchical framings that critics have identified qualitatively. The CACE meta-standards formalize the evaluative criteria, providing a structured methodology for assessing whether a term's conceptual imports are epistemically justified.

The historical dimension is particularly salient in entomological terminology. Terms like "slave" and "caste" import specific historical assumptions about social organization that do not align with modern biological understanding \cite{herbers2006, herbers2007}. Historical analysis reveals that early entomology often employed metaphors of hierarchy and control to describe insect behavior, influenced by the social contexts of the time \cite{mavhunga2018transient, sleigh2007ants}. Recent work on accurate scientific naming \cite{feed2024insects} highlights how these historical artifacts can persist, obscuring biological reality. \citeauthor{berlin1992}'s \citeyearpar{berlin1992} cross-cultural studies of biological classification demonstrate that alternative taxonomic systems—grounded in different cultural assumptions—are equally effective for organizing biological knowledge. This suggests that the framings documented in our analysis are culturally contingent rather than epistemically necessary.

## Computational Approaches to Scientific Discourse

Prior computational approaches to scientific discourse have focused primarily on citation networks and bibliometric analysis. \citeauthor{chen2006citespace}'s CiteSpace framework \citeyearpar{chen2006citespace} maps the intellectual structure of research fields through co-citation patterns, but does not analyze the semantic content of terminology. Natural language processing applications in biomedicine \cite{fairclough1992} have developed domain-specific named entity recognition and relation extraction, but these approaches optimize for information extraction rather than conceptual critique.

Our framework occupies a distinct niche: it combines the analytical depth of CDA with the scalability of computational text processing, targeting the *conceptual implications* of terminology rather than merely identifying or extracting terms. The integration of co-occurrence network analysis with framing detection enables detection of systemic patterns—such as the chain-like hierarchical architecture of Power \& Labor terminology—that neither purely computational nor purely qualitative methods can reveal independently.

## Terminology Studies in Entomology

Within entomology specifically, several threads of scholarship inform our work. \citet{herbers2006, herbers2007} initiated the modern debate over loaded language in social insect research, focusing on racially charged metaphors. \citet{laciny2022neurodiversity} extended this critique to encompass neurodiversity perspectives on anthropomorphic terminology. \citet{boomsma2018superorganismality} traced how the superorganism concept was "lost in translation" between different theoretical frameworks—a case study in the terminological dynamics our framework is designed to detect.

\citet{sleigh2007ants} provided a cultural history of myrmecology that documents how broader social and cultural currents have shaped the language of ant research across centuries. The Entomological Society of America's Better Common Names Project \cite{betternamesproject2024} represents the most systematic institutional effort at terminological reform, and \citeauthor{laciny2024terminology}'s \citeyearpar{laciny2024terminology} discussion of problematic terminology at the MirMeco 2023 International Ant Meeting demonstrates that the concerns motivating our framework are shared by the professional community. Recent epigenetic research further undercuts the biological justification for rigid "caste" terminology: \citet{warner2024caste} show that caste differentiation in ants becomes increasingly *canalized* from early development through cascading gene-expression changes modulated by juvenile hormone signaling—a fundamentally labile process that the term "caste" misleadingly implies is fixed.

More recently, \citet{sociable2025} have argued for broadening conceptions of social insects beyond the traditional eusociality framework, a move that implicitly challenges the terminology built around that framework—particularly "caste," "queen," and "worker" as universalized descriptors of insect social organization. Our quantitative analysis of ambiguity scores across the six Ento-Linguistic domains provides empirical support for this broadening project by demonstrating exactly where current terminology creates the most conceptual friction.

## Active Inference and Colony Modeling

The Free Energy Principle and Active Inference \cite{friston2010free, friston2013life} provide the theoretical backbone for our analysis. \citeauthor{clark2013whatever}'s \citeyearpar{clark2013whatever} predictive processing framework establishes the cognitive context in which language acts as a hyper-prior, and \citeauthor{kirchhoff2018markov}'s \citeyearpar{kirchhoff2018markov} application of Markov blankets to biological systems supports our analysis of how terminology mis-specifies system boundaries.

Most directly relevant is the *Active Inferants* framework of \citet{friedman2021active}, who model ant colony foraging as a multiscale ensemble of active inference agents. Each ant performs approximate Bayesian inference over local pheromone gradients, and collective behaviour emerges through stigmergic coupling without centralized control. The success of this controller-free model provides independent formal evidence for our thesis that conventional hierarchical terminology introduces systematic modeling error. Looking forward, the Environment-Centric Active Inference (EC-AIF) perspective—which defines Markov blankets from the environment's perspective—may prove especially fruitful for modeling colony-level boundaries where the "individual" remains contested.

## Positioning This Work

Our contribution is distinguished from prior work along three axes. *Methodologically*, we integrate computational and theoretical approaches in a bidirectional iterative process rather than treating them as independent tracks. *Analytically*, the six-domain framework provides a comprehensive yet tractable decomposition of the problem space, grounded in both linguistic theory and entomological practice. *Pragmatically*, the CACE meta-standards offer a constructive evaluation framework that moves beyond critique to provide actionable criteria for terminological improvement—criteria validated by the historical case of "slave" terminology reform (Section \ref{sec:discussion}).
