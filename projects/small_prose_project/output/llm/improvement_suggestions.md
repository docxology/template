## Summary

This manuscript demonstrates a commendable effort to integrate mathematical concepts into a prose-focused research project. The structure is generally well-organized, and the inclusion of LaTeX-style equations and tables is appropriate. However, the manuscript suffers from a lack of depth in several areas, particularly regarding the theoretical justifications and practical implications of the presented methodologies. The reliance on superficial descriptions and a somewhat disjointed flow suggest a need for greater rigor and a more cohesive narrative. The primary weaknesses lie in the underdeveloped discussion of convergence analysis, algorithm implementation considerations, and the overall justification for the chosen approach. Addressing these issues will significantly strengthen the manuscript’s credibility and impact.

## High Priority Improvements

The most critical issues reside in the underdeveloped sections concerning methodology and convergence analysis (Sections 2.1-2.5 and 3.3). Specifically, the ‘Mathematical Framework’ (2.1) provides a cursory overview of an optimization problem without detailing the underlying assumptions or potential limitations. The ‘Algorithm Development’ (2.2) lacks a clear explanation of why the chosen steps are optimal and doesn’t adequately address potential issues like step size selection. The “Convergence Analysis” (3.3) is severely deficient; the stated theorem (Theorem 1) is presented without sufficient context or justification, and the ‘proof sketch’ is minimal.  Furthermore, the discussion of convergence rate is entirely absent, a crucial element for any optimization algorithm.  The “Implementation Considerations” (2.4) are similarly vague, stating only that numerical stability and termination criteria are important without elaborating on specific techniques.  The lack of detail regarding these aspects undermines the credibility of the presented work.  The ‘Algorithm Convergence’ section (3.3) needs a substantial expansion, including a more detailed explanation of the assumptions underpinning the convergence theorem and a discussion of the conditions under which the algorithm is guaranteed to converge.  Finally, the ‘Key Findings’ (3.4) are presented in a fragmented manner, lacking a clear synthesis of the most important results.  To address these issues, the authors should provide more concrete examples, elaborate on the theoretical underpinnings of their methods, and offer a more robust justification for their choices. (See Section 2.2 for example - "Initialization…")

## Medium Priority Improvements

The organization of the manuscript, while generally sound, could benefit from a more fluid narrative. The transitions between sections are often abrupt, and the overall flow of ideas feels somewhat disjointed.  The ‘Comparative Analysis’ (3.5) is particularly weak, relying on a generic table without providing a substantive comparison of different optimization methods.  This section should be expanded to include a more detailed discussion of the trade-offs between the various approaches, considering factors such as convergence speed, computational cost, and sensitivity to problem conditioning.  The “Implementation Considerations” (2.4) should be expanded to include a discussion of specific techniques for addressing numerical stability issues, such as preconditioning or scaling.  The ‘Key Findings’ (3.4) need to be presented in a more organized manner, perhaps using bullet points or a table to summarize the most important results.  The ‘Future Directions’ (3.7) section is currently too brief and lacks specific suggestions for future research. (See Section 2.2 for example - "Initialization…")

## Low Priority Improvements

The manuscript’s formatting is adequate but could be improved for consistency.  The use of bullet points throughout the document is appropriate for presenting key concepts, but the formatting could be more uniform.  The ‘Expected Contributions’ (1.5) section is somewhat redundant, as the contributions are already implicitly described in the preceding sections.  The ‘Comparative Analysis’ table (3.5) could benefit from a more descriptive heading to clearly indicate the metrics being compared. (See Section 2.1 for example - "Mathematical notation using LaT eX-style equations")

## Overall Recommendation

Accept with Major Revisions. While the manuscript demonstrates a commendable attempt to integrate mathematical concepts into a prose-focused research project, significant revisions are necessary to address the underdeveloped theoretical justifications, lack of depth in the methodology, and disjointed narrative. A substantial expansion of the convergence analysis, a more detailed discussion of algorithm implementation considerations, and a more cohesive presentation of the results are crucial to strengthening the manuscript’s credibility and impact.
