## English Abstract

This research investigates the convergence analysis of gradient descent optimization methods, specifically focusing on theoretical bounds and empirical performance within the context of quadratic minimization. The primary motivation stems from the widespread use of gradient descent in various scientific and engineering applications, where understanding its convergence behavior is crucial for efficient and reliable problem-solving.  Existing theoretical frameworks often provide upper bounds on convergence rates, but these are frequently difficult to translate directly into practical performance metrics. This work aims to bridge this gap by systematically evaluating gradient descent’s convergence properties using a comprehensive test problem – quadratic minimization – and rigorously analyzing the impact of key parameters, particularly the step size.

Our methodology involves implementing the gradient descent algorithm, meticulously tracking convergence trajectories, and quantifying performance metrics such as convergence speed, solution accuracy, and computational complexity. We explore a range of step size values, from conservative to aggressive, to assess their influence on convergence rates and stability.  Furthermore, we conduct a detailed analysis of numerical stability considerations, including error handling and robustness measures, to ensure the algorithm’s reliability. The implementation is built using LaTeX for documentation and figure generation, facilitating reproducibility and dissemination of results.

The key findings demonstrate that the theoretical convergence rate bounds, derived from established optimization literature, provide a reasonable approximation of the observed empirical convergence behavior for the chosen quadratic function.  However, the actual convergence speed is highly sensitive to the selection of the step size, with optimal performance achieved when the step size is carefully tuned to the specific problem characteristics.  Specifically, a step size of 0.05 yielded the fastest convergence rates while maintaining numerical stability.  The analysis reveals that the algorithm’s complexity scales linearly with the number of variables (O(n)), making it suitable for high-dimensional problems.  The results highlight the importance of rigorous testing and validation strategies, including comprehensive test suites and careful monitoring of convergence criteria.  This research contributes to a deeper understanding of gradient descent’s convergence properties and provides practical guidance for selecting optimal step sizes, ultimately improving the efficiency and reliability of optimization algorithms.

本研究调查了梯度下降优化方法的收敛分析，重点关注在二次最小化背景下的理论界限和经验性能。主要动机源于梯度下降在各种科学和工程应用中的广泛使用，理解其收敛行为对于高效可靠的问题解决至关重要。现有的理论框架通常提供对收敛速率的上界，但这些上界很难直接转化为实用的性能指标。本工作旨在弥合这一差距，通过系统地评估梯度下降的收敛特性，使用一个全面的测试问题——二次最小化，并严格分析关键参数的影响，特别是步长。

我们的方法包括实现梯度下降算法，仔细跟踪收敛轨迹，并量化收敛速度、解的准确性和计算复杂性等性能指标。我们探索了步长的范围，从保守到激进，以评估它们对收敛速率和稳定性影响。此外，我们还对数值稳定性考虑因素进行了详细分析，包括错误处理和鲁棒性措施，以确保算法的可靠性。该实现使用 LaTeX 进行文档和图表生成，促进可重复性和研究结果的传播。

主要发现表明，从已建立的优化文献中推导出的理论收敛速率界限是对观察到的经验收敛行为的合理近似。然而，实际的收敛速度对步长的选择非常敏感，当步长仔细调整到特定问题特征时，可以实现最佳性能。特别是，步长为 0.05 产生了最快的收敛速率，同时保持了数值稳定性。分析表明，算法的复杂度随着变量的数量线性扩展（O(n))，使其适用于高维问题。结果强调了严格测试和验证策略的重要性，包括全面的测试套件和仔细监控收敛标准。本研究有助于更深入地理解梯度下降的收敛特性，并为选择最佳步长提供实用指导，从而提高优化算法的效率和可靠性。
