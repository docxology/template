## Overview

This manuscript details a research project focused on the convergence analysis of gradient descent optimization techniques applied to quadratic minimization problems. The work investigates theoretical bounds on convergence rates and empirically assesses the performance of gradient descent across various step size configurations. The core objective is to provide a comprehensive understanding of gradient descent’s behavior in this specific scenario, contributing to the broader field of numerical optimization. The project utilizes a fully-tested implementation, incorporating detailed analysis and visualization capabilities, and is designed for reproducibility through an automated research pipeline.

## Key Contributions

This research makes several key contributions to the understanding of gradient descent optimization. Firstly, it establishes theoretical convergence rates for gradient descent on quadratic functions, linking these bounds to empirical observations. Specifically, the manuscript demonstrates that the convergence rate approaches √ 𝜅−1
𝜅+1 when using an optimal step size, highlighting the importance of step size selection. Secondly, the project provides a robust and well-documented implementation of gradient descent, incorporating numerical stability considerations and error handling mechanisms. Thirdly, the automated analysis pipeline generates detailed convergence trajectories and performance metrics, facilitating a comprehensive assessment of algorithm behavior. Finally, the manuscript showcases a complete research pipeline, from code implementation to publication-ready figures, offering a valuable template for future optimization studies.

## Methodology Summary

The research employs a gradient descent algorithm to minimize quadratic functions. The algorithm’s iterative update rule, 𝑥𝑘+1 = 𝑥𝑘 − 𝛼∇𝑓 (𝑥𝑘 ), is implemented with configurable parameters, including the step size (𝛼). The test problem is a quadratic function of ℝ𝑛, allowing for analytical solutions to validate the algorithm’s convergence. The analysis focuses on convergence rate theory, step size selection criteria, and a detailed experimental setup encompassing various step size analyses, convergence criteria, and performance metrics.  Crucially, the implementation incorporates numerical stability considerations and a robust testing strategy, including edge case coverage.

## Principal Results

Empirical results demonstrate that the convergence speed of gradient descent is highly sensitive to the chosen step size. Utilizing a step size of 𝛼 = 0.2 yielded the fastest convergence, but also exhibited oscillatory behavior. Conversely, a more conservative step size of 𝛼 = 0.01 provided stable, monotonic convergence, achieving the analytical optimum within 165 iterations. Quantitative results confirm the theoretical convergence rate, with observed convergence rates aligning closely with the predicted bounds. The project successfully validated the theoretical convergence rate against empirical performance, showcasing the importance of step size selection for optimal convergence.

## Significance and Impact

This research contributes to the foundational understanding of gradient descent optimization, particularly in the context of quadratic minimization. The established theoretical bounds and empirical findings provide valuable guidance for practitioners seeking to optimize functions using gradient descent. The project’s comprehensive implementation and automated analysis pipeline serve as a valuable template for future research, promoting reproducible optimization studies. Furthermore, the detailed investigation into step size sensitivity and numerical stability offers insights applicable to a broader range of optimization problems, ultimately advancing the field of numerical optimization and its applications across diverse scientific and engineering domains.
