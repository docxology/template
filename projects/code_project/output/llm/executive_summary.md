## Overview

This research investigates the convergence behavior of gradient descent optimization applied to quadratic minimization problems. The project aims to provide theoretical bounds on convergence rates and empirically assess their validity through detailed experimentation. The core of the work involves implementing gradient descent, systematically analyzing its performance with varying step sizes, and generating comprehensive data for both theoretical and empirical validation. The project’s ultimate goal is to establish a robust understanding of gradient descent’s convergence properties within a controlled, well-documented framework.

## Key Contributions

This manuscript presents a significant contribution to the understanding of gradient descent optimization through a rigorous, experimentally-driven analysis. Specifically, the work provides a detailed examination of convergence rates for quadratic functions, linking theoretical bounds (based on the condition number of the matrix) to empirical observations. The implementation includes a fully tested gradient descent algorithm, coupled with a comprehensive test suite covering a range of step sizes and tolerance levels.  Crucially, the research generates detailed convergence trajectories and performance metrics, allowing for direct comparison between theoretical predictions and observed behavior. The automated analysis pipeline, incorporating figure generation and data recording, enhances the reproducibility and accessibility of the research findings, offering a valuable template for future investigations into optimization algorithms.

## Methodology Summary

The research employs a systematic methodology centered around the implementation of gradient descent for quadratic minimization. The algorithm’s core logic, as outlined in Section 2.1.1, is implemented in a testable code base. The experimental setup, detailed in Section 2.3, involves systematically varying step sizes (𝛼) from 0.01 to 0.2, while maintaining a fixed tolerance (𝜖) and maximum iterations.  Convergence analysis, as described in Section 2.2, utilizes both theoretical convergence rate theory (Section 2.2.1) and empirical observation of convergence trajectories (Section 3.1.1). The implementation incorporates numerical stability considerations (Section 2.4.1) and a robust testing strategy (Section 2.3.3) to ensure reliable results.

## Principal Results

The experimental results demonstrate a clear relationship between step size selection and convergence performance. As detailed in Section 3.1.2, smaller step sizes (𝛼 = 0.01) exhibit stable, monotonic convergence, closely aligning with the theoretical convergence rate (as shown in Figure 3).  Larger step sizes (𝛼 = 0.2) demonstrate faster initial progress but show signs of instability and oscillation, particularly near convergence.  Quantitative results, presented in Table 1, confirm that the algorithm achieves the analytical optimum within a reasonable number of iterations, regardless of the chosen step size. The analysis highlights the importance of carefully selecting step sizes to balance convergence speed and numerical stability.

## Significance and Impact

This research contributes to the broader field of numerical optimization by providing a detailed and experimentally validated analysis of gradient descent’s convergence behavior for quadratic functions. The findings offer practical guidance for selecting optimal step sizes, improving the efficiency and reliability of gradient descent implementations. The automated analysis pipeline and well-documented code serve as a valuable template for researchers and engineers seeking to develop and test optimization algorithms.  Furthermore, the project’s emphasis on reproducibility and transparency strengthens the foundation for future research in this area, potentially leading to improved optimization techniques and applications across diverse scientific and engineering domains.
