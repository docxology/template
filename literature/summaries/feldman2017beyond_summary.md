**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Beyond Volume: The Impact of Complex Healthcare Data on the Machine Learning Pipeline" by Feldman et al. (2015) is a comprehensive review of the challenges that arise when machine learning techniques are applied to complex healthcare data, which are characterized as high-dimensional, heterogeneous, probabilistic, incomplete, uncertain, and noisy. The authors argue that while the sheer volume of data created is a challenge for informatics in this field, it is not sufficient to simply possess such capability; rather, there must be an increasing focus on developing innovative ways to utilize data collected as part of existing workﬂows rather than demonstrating value with models requiring additional data elements. The paper highlights that the attributes of healthcare data present a vast set of heterogeneous, high-dimensional, probabilistic, incomplete, uncertain, and noisy attributes. However, in conjunction with machine learning methodologies, the increasing availability of data has the potential to provide novel and actionable insights to the field of healthcare.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors identify six key challenges that arise when machine learning is applied to complex healthcare data: 1) incomplete data; 2) high dimensionality; 3) probabilistic nature; 4) uncertainty; 5) heterogeneity; and 6) noise. The paper also discusses the potential of Big Data in healthcare, but notes that this is not suﬃcient to ensure the realization of informatics true potential in healthcare. Rather, it is important to remember that while we may have reached a point computationally in which the manipulation of Big Data and execution of complex modeling techniques are possible, purely possessing such capability is not suﬃcient to ensure the realization of informatics true potential in healthcare. The ability to address such complexities and ensure the eﬀective consumption of healthcare data into the machine learning pipeline relies on more than analytic capability: it relies on a deep understanding of the biological and clinical mechanisms through which the data has been generated.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors present a general discussion regarding the fundamental challenges presented by such data with respect to the informatics pipeline. The paper highlights that awareness of such an impact is only the ﬁrst step, it is our hope that others will draw on these caveats and look to considerations in the design and implementation of new works, which blend together both technological capability and medical understanding to better serve those individuals in need.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors present a general discussion regarding the fundamental challenges presented by such data with respect to the informatics pipeline. However, aware-ness of such an impact is only the ﬁrst step. It is our hope that others will draw on these caveats and look to considerations in the design and implementation of new works, which blend together both technological capability and medical understanding to better serve those individuals in need.
