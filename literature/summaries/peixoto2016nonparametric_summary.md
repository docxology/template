**Overview/Summary**

The paper presents a nonparametric Bayesian approach to model selection for stochastic block models (SBMs) with categorical observations. The authors first discuss the limitations of existing approaches and their own previous work. They then describe the new method, which they call "hierarchical" because it makes use of a hierarchical prior distribution on the number of groups in the SBM. This is in contrast to the nonparametric approach that they previously developed, where the number of groups was not modeled as a random variable. The authors also discuss the choice between two different priors for the edge counts and the degree counts. They show how their new method can be used to determine the number of groups in the SBM, and argue that it is better than the previous approach at least for small numbers of groups.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors present a nonparametric Bayesian model selection approach for stochastic block models (SBMs) with categorical observations. The main contributions are the development of this new method and the comparison to their own previous work. They show that the hierarchical prior is better than the nonparametric one, at least when the number of groups is small.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors first discuss the existing approaches for model selection in SBMs with categorical observations. These are based on a likelihood ratio test (LRT) and a Bayesian approach where the number of groups was not modeled as a random variable. The nonparametric Bayesian approach they previously developed is a variant of this, but it does not make use of a prior distribution on the number of groups. The authors then describe their new method, which makes use of a hierarchical prior for the number of groups and compare it to the previous one.

**Results/Data**

The authors show that the LRT is not suitable when there are many possible models. They also show that the nonparametric Bayesian approach they previously developed has some limitations. The main results are the comparison between the two approaches, and the application of the new method to determine the number of groups in the SBM.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors discuss the choice of a prior for the edge counts. They also mention that their nonparametric Bayesian approach is limited when the number of groups is small. The paper does not discuss future work, but it could be extended by considering the hierarchical prior on the number of groups in more detail.
