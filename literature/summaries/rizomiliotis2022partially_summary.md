**Overview/Summary**
The paper "Partially Oblivious Neural Network Inference" presents a novel approach to reduce the computational cost of neural network inference on encrypted data by revealing 80% of the model's weights in order to accelerate multiplications. The authors propose a new attack model for ML model inference and introduce new security definitions per use case, which is the first time that such an approach is proposed in this field.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The main contributions are:
1. A novel attack model for ML model inference: The authors propose a new attack model for ML model inference, where the attacker can reveal 80% of the selected model's weights to reduce the linear layers cost of multiplications by a factor of 4.
2. New security definitions per use case: The paper proposes new security definitions per use case, which is the first time that such an approach is proposed in this field.

**Methodology/Approach**
The authors propose a new attack model for ML model inference and introduce new security definitions per use case, which is the first time that such an approach is proposed in this field. The paper does not describe any methodology or approach used to obtain the results. It only describes the main contributions of the work.

**Results/Data**
The paper does not present any data. It only presents the main contributions and a summary of the paper.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The authors do not discuss the limitations of their work. They also do not mention future work, but it is implied that they will follow up with new attack models and more security definitions per use case in order to leverage the results of this research and provide new design guidelines for e-compiler.

**References**
The paper references 12 papers.
