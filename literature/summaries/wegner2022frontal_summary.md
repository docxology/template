=== OVERVIEW/SUMMARY ===

The current study investigates the neural mechanisms of cognitive e/uniFB00ort and its relationship to mental fatigue. The authors of this paper propose a distinction between these two concepts. They argue that the same brain regions are involved in both, but the underlying processes are different. In particular, they suggest that the common changes in connectivity associated with task demands and time on task may be related to cognitive e/uniFB00ort (the motivation to perform a task) rather than mental fatigue (the inability to do so). The authors' main findings are based on an analysis of the neural activity recorded from two monkeys performing a visual search task. The paper is well-structured, and the results are presented in a clear and concise manner. The use of a specific experimental design allows for a direct comparison between the effects of time on task and the effects of task demands.

=== KEY CONTRIBUTIONS/FOUNDS ===

The main findings of this study are that the neural activity recorded from two monkeys performing a visual search task is differentially affected by the time spent on the task and the difficulty of the task. The authors' analysis of the data suggests that the common changes in connectivity associated with both factors may be related to cognitive e/uniFB00ort rather than mental fatigue.

=== METHODOLOGY/APPROACH ===

The study used a visual search task, which is a well-established paradigm for investigating attention and working memory. The monkeys were trained on this task over 10 days before the data was collected. The authors' analysis of the neural activity recorded from the two monkeys performing the task is based on a comparison between the effects of time spent on the task (i.e., the duration of the recording) and the difficulty of the task (i.e., the number of items in the array). This design allows for a direct comparison between the effects of these two factors. The analysis of the data was performed using a variety of statistical methods, including cross-correlation analysis.

=== RESULTS/DATA ===

The main results of this study are based on an analysis of the neural activity recorded from the two monkeys performing the visual search task. The authors' analysis of the data suggests that the common changes in connectivity associated with both factors may be related to cognitive e/uniFB00ort rather than mental fatigue.

=== LIMITATIONS/DISCUSSION ===

The study is based on an analysis of the neural activity recorded from only two monkeys, and future work needs to confirm these findings. The authors also note that the restriction to two cortical areas provides a limited picture of the neural interactions that underlie cognitive e/uniFB00ort. The investigation of e/uniFB00ective connectivity changes within an extended fronto-parietal network may provide better insight into e/uniFB00ort e/uniFB00ects in task-speciFB00c areas. In addition, although the authors show robust e/uniFB00ects across many days and two monkeys, future work needs to con/uniFB01rm these results and generalize the e/uniFB00ects to human subjects.
