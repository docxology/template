**Overview/Summary**

The authors of this paper study a model of collective foraging in which multiple individuals search for food at a central site and then recruit others to follow them to the location where they found the most food. The model is based on the idea that the amount of food at each site is uncertain, but the number of successful foragers at each site is known. They compare the behavior of an infinite population with that of a finite one. In the infinite case, the optimal strategy is to always recruit others when you find the most food because this maximizes the long-term reward rate. However, in the finite case, the optimal strategy is to only recruit others at intermediate levels of communication and recruitment. The authors also compare their model with a variation that includes multiple competing groups (hives), where foraging at a site is subject to both within-group competition as well as between group competition.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The paper studies the dynamics of this system in the case where the number of successful foragers at each site is known. The authors show that, if the number of successful foragers is the same at all sites, then there will be a boundary layer at ρ=1 (i.e., when the fraction of foragers at any given site equals 1) in which the stationary distribution of the system has a unique fixed point and the behavior of the finite population model is qualitatively different from that of the infinite population. The authors also show that there will be a boundary layer at ρ=1 as long as φi(u) is decreasing, where φi(u) is the fraction of foragers that recruit others when they find u food. This does not arise from a peculiar choice of foraging probability φi(u), but rather from the communication structure (the recruitment probability ρ). The authors also compare their model with a variation that includes multiple competing groups (hives), where foraging at a site is subject to both within-group competition as well as between group competition.
