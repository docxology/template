**Overview/Summary**

The study of two-proton emission in nuclear reactions is a long-standing problem in nuclear physics. The main difficulty lies in that the two protons are not independent and the final state of the residual nucleus is not a definite one, but a mixture with different excitation energies. In this paper, we investigate the two-proton emission from 16O and 40Ca nuclei by using the relativistic distorted wave function (RDW) method. The RDW method has been widely used in the study of high energy nuclear reactions. It is an approximate method which can be applied to the study of the two-proton emission. In this paper, we use the RDW method to calculate the cross sections and the angular distributions of the 16O(2p1/2)−1 and 40Ca(2p3/2)−2 for different electron energies. The results show that the cross section is a function of the incident energy and the two-proton emission angle. The maximum value of the cross sections and the corresponding angles are at the same time. This means that the two protons are emitted in the forward direction. In addition, the RDW method can be used to calculate the 16O(1p3/2)−1 and 40Ca(1p1/2)−1 for different electron energies. The results show that the cross sections of the 16O(1p3/2)−1 and 40Ca(1p1/2)−1 are also functions of the incident energy and the two-proton emission angle. The maximum value of the cross section and the corresponding angle are at the same time. This means that the two protons are emitted in the forward direction too. In this paper, we use the RDW method to study the 16O(1p3/2)−1 and 40Ca(1p1/2)−1 for different electron energies. The results show that the cross sections of the 16O(1p3/2)−1 and 40Ca(1p1/2)−1 are also functions of the incident energy and the two-proton emission angle.
