**Associations Between Menstrual Cycle Phases and Heart Rate, Well-being, and Performance in Female Soccer Players**

**Overview/Summary**
This study investigates the relationships between menstrual cycle phases and physiological responses, subjective well-being, and performance outcomes in female soccer players. The researchers aimed to explore whether menstrual cycle phase affects heart rate, perceived exertion, and overall well-being during exercise.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The study found significant associations between menstrual cycle phases and heart rate, with higher heart rates observed during the follicular phase (days 1-14) compared to the luteal phase (days 15-28). Additionally, participants reported higher perceived exertion and lower well-being during the luteal phase. No significant differences were found in performance outcomes, such as distance covered or speed.

**Methodology/Approach**
The study recruited 20 female soccer players with regular menstrual cycles. Participants completed a standardized exercise protocol on three occasions: once during each of the follicular, ovulatory, and luteal phases. Heart rate was measured using electrocardiography, while perceived exertion and well-being were assessed using standardized questionnaires.

**Results/Data**
The results showed that heart rate increased significantly during the follicular phase compared to the luteal phase (p < 0.05). Perceived exertion ratings were higher during the luteal phase (p < 0.01), while well-being scores were lower (p < 0.05). No significant differences were found in performance outcomes.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The study's limitations include a small sample size and the use of self-reported measures for perceived exertion and well-being. Future research should aim to recruit larger, more diverse samples and utilize objective measures of physiological responses. The findings have implications for female athletes' training and competition schedules, highlighting the importance of considering menstrual cycle phase when planning exercise programs.
