**Overview/Summary**

This paper presents a novel approach to reward maximization through active inference (AI) in partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). The authors show that the standard AI scheme is not Bellman optimal on temporal horizons, and they propose a new AI scheme called sophisticated AI. They also prove that the new scheme is Bellman optimal for finite temporal horizons.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this paper are the proof of the non-Bellman optimality of the standard AI scheme and the development of the sophisticated AI scheme, which is shown to be Bellman optimal on all finite temporal horizons. The authors also show that the new scheme is more efficient than the old one in most reward maximization tasks.

**Methodology/Approach**

The paper first reviews the existing active inference (AI) schemes for POMDPs. It then presents the non-Bellman optimality of the standard AI and the development of the sophisticated AI, which is shown to be Bellman optimal on all finite temporal horizons. The authors also prove that the new scheme is more efficient than the old one in most reward maximization tasks.

**Results/Data**

The paper does not present any empirical results or data. It only presents theoretical results and comparisons between the standard AI and the sophisticated AI.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The main limitation of this work is that it can be scaled up to solve more complex problems currently handled by RL approaches, but it has not been done yet. The authors also mention some future research directions in the last section of the paper.
