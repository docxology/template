**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Inferring Degrees from Incomplete Networks and Nonlinear Dynamics" by Chunheng Jiang, Jianxi Gao, and Malik Magdon-Isma'il (2020) is a study on the inverse problem of graph sampling. The authors consider the case where the goal is to estimate the average degree of a network given only a sample of nodes from it. This is an important problem in many areas of science such as social networks, biology and computer science. In this paper, the authors propose a new method for estimating the average degree which is based on a nonlinear dynamics model. The main contributions of the paper are to introduce a novel inverse problem of graph sampling and develop a theoretical framework for it.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contribution of the paper is to show that the average degree can be estimated from an incomplete network, where the nodes in the sample do not have to be randomly selected. The authors also propose a new method for estimating the size of the human interactome based on the nonlinear dynamics model and compare it with the existing methods.

**Methodology/Approach**

The main idea is that if we know the average degree of a network, then we can estimate the probability distribution of the number of nodes in the sample. The authors use this fact to develop an inverse problem of graph sampling which is to find the average degree given the probability distribution of the number of nodes in the sample. The authors first introduce the nonlinear dynamics model and show that it can be used to infer the size of the human interactome. Then, they propose a new method for estimating the average degree based on this model. This method is different from the existing methods which are based on the linear dynamics model.

**Results/Data**

The authors use the data of the human protein-protein interaction network and the yeast protein-protein interaction network to test their method. The results show that the proposed method can be used to estimate the average degree more accurately than the existing methods.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The main limitation of the paper is that it only considers the case where the nodes in the sample do not have to be randomly selected. It does not consider the other cases such as the case where the nodes are randomly selected and the case where the probability distribution of the number of nodes in the sample is known. The authors also mention some future work.
