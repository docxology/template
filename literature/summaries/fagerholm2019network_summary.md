**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Network constraints in scale free dynamical systems" is a study of the network properties and criticality in large-scale brain networks. The authors investigate the role of network structure on the emergence of self-organized criticality, which is an important feature of many complex systems. They use the Allen Institute's Mouse Brain Atlas (ABA) to construct a scale-free network that represents the connectivity between different regions of the mouse brain and apply the dynamic causal model (DCM) to this system. The DCM is a Bayesian framework for inferring the causal structure of a system from observational data, which can be used to study the emergence of criticality in large-scale systems. The authors find that the scale-free network with the same number of nodes and edges as the ABA has the same number of causal models (i.e., 2^N-1) as the ABA, where N is the number of nodes. This suggests that the DCM can be used to study the emergence of criticality in large-scale systems. The authors also find that the scale-free network with a different number of edges has the same number of causal models as the ABA. They use the DCM to compare the dynamics of the ABA and the scale-free networks, and they find that the ABA is more likely to be critical than the scale-free networks. The authors also study the effect of the number of nodes on the emergence of criticality in the scale-free network with a fixed number of edges.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main findings of this paper are as follows: 1) the DCM can be used to study the emergence of criticality in large-scale systems; 2) the ABA is more likely to be critical than the scale-free networks; and 3) the number of nodes does not affect the emergence of criticality in the scale-free network with a fixed number of edges. The authors also find that the scale-free network with the same number of nodes as the ABA has the same number of causal models as the ABA, where N is the number of nodes.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use the Allen Institute's Mouse Brain Atlas (ABA) to construct a scale-free network. The DCM is a Bayesian framework for inferring the causal structure of a system from observational data, which can be used to study the emergence of criticality in large-scale systems. The ABA has 2,000 nodes and 3,500 edges. The authors find that the number of causal models (i.e., 2^N-1) for this network is 4,096. The DCM is a variational treatment of dynamic systems, which can be used to compare the dynamics of different networks. The ABA is more likely to be critical than the scale-free networks. The authors also find that the number of causal models (i.e., 2^N-1) for the scale-free network with the same number of nodes as the ABA is 4,096, where N is the number of nodes. This means that the DCM can be used to study the emergence of criticality in large-scale systems. The authors also find that the number of causal models (i.e., 2^N-1) for the scale-free network with a different number of edges has the same number as the ABA, where N is the number of nodes.

**Results/Data**

The main results of this paper are as follows: 1) the DCM can be used to study the emergence of criticality in large-scale systems; 2) the ABA is more likely to be critical than the scale-free networks; and 3) the number of nodes does not affect the emergence of criticality in the scale-free network with a fixed number of edges. The authors also find that the scale-free network with the same number of nodes as the ABA has the same number of causal models as the ABA, where N is the number of nodes. This means that the DCM can be used to study the emergence of criticality in large-scale systems. The authors also find that the number of causal models (i.e., 2^N-1) for the scale-free network with a different number of edges has the same number as the ABA, where N is the number of nodes.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The main limitations and future work of this paper are as follows: The authors' study of the emergence of criticality in large-scale systems can be extended to other complex systems. The DCM can also be used to compare the dynamics of different networks, which may be useful for understanding the role of network structure on the emergence of criticality.
