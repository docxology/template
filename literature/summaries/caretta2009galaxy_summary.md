**Overview/Summary**
The authors investigate the relationship between the dynamical state of a cluster and the activity (star formation and AGN) of its member galaxies in the Abell 85 galaxy cluster. The authors use the $\Delta$-test to identify five substructures, which are then used as a proxy for the dynamical state of the cluster. These substructures are: C2, F, SB, SE, and W. The authors also classify the A85 member galaxies into HII, LLAGN (low-luminosity AGNs), LINERs, Sy1, and noEL (no emission line) based on the 3D distribution of the 367 member galaxies in the cluster and their radial velocities. They use a homogeneous sample of 232 spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to study the activity of the A85 member galaxies. The authors find that 17% of the A85 members are HII, 17% are LLAGNs, 5% are LINERs and 2.6% are high-luminosity AGNs, with the remaining being noEL (no emission line). This is a much higher AGN fraction than previously reported in the literature.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The authors find that there is some evidence for an enhanced activity of both types in substructures which are in the early stage of merging with the cluster. The main results of this work are: (a) they found a very large number of LLAGNs (Ho et al. 1993) in A85, with a similar abundance to the one found in compact groups of galaxies (Coziol et al. 1998); this suggests that the LLAGN phenomenon is very common in dense environments; (b) there is some evidence of enhanced activity, both SF and AGN, in substructures in the early stage on their process of merging with the cluster; (c) they suggest that the distribution of active galaxies may be used to search for the presence of subtructures in clusters of galaxies.

**Methodology/Approach**
The authors use the $\Delta$-test to identify five substructures. The authors also classify the A85 member galaxies into HII, LLAGN (low-luminosity AGNs), LINERs, Sy1, and noEL (no emission line) based on the 3D distribution of the 367 member galaxies in the cluster and their radial velocities. They use a homogeneous sample of 232 spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to study the activity of the A85 member galaxies.

**Results/Data**
The authors find that there is some concentration of noEL around the center as expected. The HII galaxies show some concentration in the SE quadrant. This is the region comprising the majority of the substructures found in A85, namely the SE, the X-ray filament and the SB. Since this ridge of clumps is probably the most dynamically active part of the cluster in recent times, representing a sequence of future merging structures to the main body of the cluster, they are led to conclude that there is some stimulation of SF activity by this dynamical status. More than that, the AGN activity (Fig. 5), both the low energy phenomenon (LLAGNs and LINERs) and high energy one (Sy2), present a more enhanced concentration around the ridge. All of the Sy2 galaxies are located on the eastern side of A85, and two of them are members of the SE substructure. This relative overdensity of active galaxies inside the substructure SE suggests that activity is favored inside substructures that are beginning to interact with the cluster.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The main results of this work are: (a) they found a very large number of LLAGNs (Ho et al. 1993) in A85, with a similar abundance to the one found in compact groups of galaxies (Coziol et al. 1998); this suggests that the LLAGN phenomenon is very common in dense environments; (b) there is some evidence of enhanced activity, both SF and AGN, in substructures in the early stage on their process of merging with the cluster; (c) they suggest that the distribution of active galaxies may be used to search for the presence of subtructures in clusters of galaxies.
