**Overview/Summary**
The paper introduces the PAIR- Agent (Probabilistic Active Inference-based Resilient) for achieving resilience in distributed computing continuum systems (DCCS). The authors argue that DCCS are becoming increasingly important, as they can be used to provide a wide range of services and applications. However, the current state-of-the-art is not sufficient to ensure the required level of reliability and availability. In this paper, the authors propose a unified framework for achieving resilience in DCCS. The PAIR- Agent performs three main functions: (i) constructing a probabilistic graphical model (PGM) through device log analysis, (ii) identifying faults while managing uncertainties using Markov blankets and the free energy principle (FEP), and (iii) autonomously healing issues via active inference. Through its closed-loop cycle of observation, inference, and action, the PAIR- Agent ensures adaptive stability, self-healing capability, and sustained operational continuity.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The authors first construct a PGM through device log analysis, which is used to identify the causal relationships between different variables in the system. The PGM is then used for fault diagnosis. It is also used to determine the optimal action that can be taken to ensure the system's stability and availability. The FEP is applied to manage uncertainties while making a decision. The authors use the Markov blanket (MB) concept, which is an extension of the causal Markov chain (CMC). The MB is defined as the set of all possible states in the CMC that are compatible with the current state. The MB can be used for fault diagnosis and to determine the optimal action. The FEP is applied to manage the uncertainty while making a decision. The authors also discuss the scalability, principled and accurate fault inference, safe decision-making, and robustness of the PAIR- Agent's belief update.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The authors do not evaluate their proposed framework with real-world data or testbeds. This is an important future work. The authors also mention that they will extend this research with detailed and distributed implementation, empirical validation, and evaluation under a real-time testbed in the future.
