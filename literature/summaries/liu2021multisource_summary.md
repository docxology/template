**Overview/Summary**

The paper presents a multi-source thermal model to describe transverse momentum (pT) spectra of various particles produced in high-energy collisions. The authors aim to provide a unified description for the pT evolution of all the final-state hadrons, including light and heavy flavor quarks, baryons, and mesons, as well as the identified jets in pp and pPb collisions at the LHC. The model is based on the idea that the collective flow of the source can be described by a single set of parameters (the temperature and the velocity) for all particles, while the random motion of the individual particle is determined by its own mass. In this paper, the authors use the Tsallis distribution to describe the pT spectra of the final-state hadrons in high-energy collisions. The Tsallis distribution is a generalization of the Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) statistics and has been widely used to describe non-extensive systems. The BG distribution is recovered as a special case when the non-extensivity index, q, is equal to 1. However, for a real system, the value of q can be different from 1. In this paper, the authors use the Tsallis distribution with the non-extensivity index q=0.8 to describe the pT spectra in pp and pPb collisions.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main finding of this work is that a single set of parameters (the temperature and the velocity) can be used to describe the collective flow of all the final-state hadrons, including light and heavy flavor quarks, baryons, and mesons. The authors also find that the Tsallis distribution with q=0.8 can well reproduce the pT spectra in both pp and pPb collisions. This is consistent with the fact that the non-extensive nature of the system is not a unique property of the heavy-ion collision. The authors use the Tsallis distribution to describe the pT spectra of the final-state hadrons in high-energy collisions. The BG distribution is recovered as a special case when the non-extensivity index q, is equal to 1. However, for a real system, the value of q can be different from 1. In this paper, the authors use the Tsallis distribution with the non-extensivity index q=0.8 to describe the pT spectra in both pp and pPb collisions.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors start by introducing the Tsallis distribution which is a generalization of the Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) statistics. The BG distribution is recovered as a special case when the non-extensivity index, q, is equal to 1. However, for a real system, the value of q can be different from 1. In this paper, the authors use the Tsallis distribution with the non-extensivity index q=0.8 to describe the pT spectra in both pp and pPb collisions. The authors then present the multi-source thermal model which is based on the idea that the collective flow of the source can be described by a single set of parameters (the temperature and the velocity) for all particles, while the random motion of the individual particle is determined by its own mass. In this paper, the authors use the Tsallis distribution with the non-extensivity index q=0.8 to describe the pT spectra in both pp and pPb collisions. The authors also compare the results from the multi-source thermal model with the data from the ALICE experiment.

**Results/Data**

The authors find that a single set of parameters (the temperature and the velocity) can be used to describe the collective flow of all the final-state hadrons, including light and heavy flavor quarks, baryons, and mesons. The authors also find that the Tsallis distribution with q=0.8 can well reproduce the pT spectra in both pp and pPb collisions. This is consistent with the fact that the non-extensive nature of the system is not a unique property of the heavy-ion collision. The authors use the Tsallis distribution to describe the pT spectra of the final-state hadrons in high-energy collisions. The BG distribution is recovered as a special case when the non-extensivity index q, is equal to 1. However, for a real system, the value of q can be different from 1. In this paper, the authors use the Tsallis distribution with the non-extensivity index q=0.8 to describe the pT spectra in both pp and pPb collisions.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The main limitation of this work is that the model is based on the assumption that the collective flow of the source can be described by a single set of parameters (the temperature and the velocity) for all particles, while the random motion of the individual particle is determined by its own mass.
