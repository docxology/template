**Tracking and tracing in the UK: a dynamic causal model**

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an unprecedented global response, with many countries implementing measures to control its spread. The United Kingdom (UK) is no exception; however, the UK government's strategy for controlling the spread of the virus has been subject to criticism. This paper presents a dynamic causal model that can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of tracking and tracing in the UK. It uses data from the first wave of the pandemic and shows how the number of detected cases per day is related to the efficacy of the tracking and tracing (TT) protocol, the number of people tested per day, and the number of people infected but not yet detected. The model also predicts that the TT protocol can be used to defer or postpone a second wave until it can be rendered innocuous by herd immunity. It concludes that it would have been possible to delay the first wave indefinitely had the TT protocol been implemented at the onset of the pandemic, and that the requisite efficacy for this is much lower than what was required to achieve the same effect in the second wave.

**Overview/Summary**

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an unprecedented global response, with many countries implementing measures to control its spread. The United Kingdom (UK) is no exception; however, the UK government's strategy for controlling the spread of the virus has been subject to criticism. This paper presents a dynamic causal model that can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of tracking and tracing in the UK. It uses data from the first wave of the pandemic and shows how the number of detected cases per day is related to the efficacy of the tracking and tracing (TT) protocol, the number of people tested per day, and the number of people infected but not yet detected. The model also predicts that the TT protocol can be used to defer or postpone a second wave until it can be rendered innocuous by herd immunity. It concludes that it would have been possible to delay the first wave indefinitely had the TT protocol been implemented at the onset of the pandemic, and that the requisite efficacy for this is much lower than what was required to achieve the same effect in the second wave.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The paper presents a dynamic causal model (DCM) that can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of tracking and tracing in the UK. The DCM is based on the first wave of the pandemic, which occurred between March 2020 and May 2021. It shows how the number of detected cases per day is related to the efficacy of the TT protocol, the number of people tested per day, and the number of people infected but not yet detected. The model also predicts that the TT protocol can be used to defer or postpone a second wave until it can be rendered innocuous by herd immunity. It concludes that it would have been possible to delay the first wave indefinitely had the TT protocol been implemented at the onset of the pandemic, and that the requisite efficacy for this is much lower than what was required to achieve the same effect in the second wave.

**Methodology/Approach**

The DCM is based on data from the first wave of the pandemic. The model also predicts that the TT protocol can be used to defer or postpone a second wave until it can be rendered innocuous by herd immunity. It concludes that it would have been possible to delay the first wave indefinitely had the TT protocol been implemented at the onset of the pandemic, and that the requisite efficacy for this is much lower than what was required to achieve the same effect in the second wave.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The answer to this question is no. This is because the context in which the second wave manifests is very different from the first wave. This follows because of the acquisition of herd immunity, which means that the spread of the virus—before the second wave—was substantially attenuated. In turn, this means that the requisite efficacy of FTTI is substantially smaller. Th is point is illustrated in Figure 9 (top left panel) by evaluating the predicted outcomes at the (18-month) time horizon under four scenarios. The first scenario was based upon the posterior estimates of the current testing parameters (current). The second scenario entailed an increase in efficacy from 0 to 1 in 32 steps. The results are shown using the format of Figure 4, for every fourth step. The key insight from this figure is that as one increases the efficacy of tracking and tracing, the second wave is deferred or postponed beyond a time horizon (here, 18 months). At the same time, the total number of detected cases per day increases. These effects are summarised by the blue and orange arrows. So, what levels of tracking and tracing would be necessary to preclude a second wave within a time horizon of 18 months? The paper concludes that as the efficacy of tracking and tracing increases there is a marked reduction in cumulative deaths in the order of 10,000 people. This reflects the delay in the second wave (solid line). Quantitatively, it would be sufficient to have an efficacy of about 24% or greater defer the second wave until 18 months, under the prior assumptions of the model. According to these estimates, this would entail peak testing rates of less than 10,000 tests per day, well within the reach of current testing capacity.
