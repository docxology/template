=== OVERVIEW ===
The paper "Physics of Active Emulsions" by Christoph M. Amsler et al. is a comprehensive review on the physics of active emulsions. The authors provide an overview of the current understanding of active emulsion systems and their properties, as well as the underlying physical mechanisms that control the behavior of these complex fluids.

=== KEY CONTRIBUTIONS/ FINDINGS ===
The main findings in this paper are the following:
1. **Non-Equilibrium phase transitions**: The authors show that a non-equilibrium phase transition can be induced by an external driving force and that the order parameter is not conserved in the stationary state, but it is a dynamical variable. This is different from the equilibrium case where the order parameter is a thermodynamic potential.
2. **Non-Equilibrium universality**: The authors find that the non-equilibrium phase transition has the same universal properties as the equilibrium one. In particular, the critical exponents are the same in both cases and the scaling functions are the same at the leading order. This is different from the case of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation where the critical exponents are different.
3. **Non-Equilibrium finite-size effects**: The authors find that the non-equilibrium phase transition has the same finite-size effects as the equilibrium one. In particular, the shift and the rounding of the specific heat capacity peak at the critical point are the same in both cases.

=== METHOD/ APPROACH ===
The authors use a mean-field theory to study the active emulsion systems. The basic idea is that the dynamics of the active particles are described by a Langevin equation with an effective temperature T, which can be determined from the energy dissipation rate per particle. In this paper, the authors consider the case where the driving force F is proportional to the local density and the case where the driving force is constant. The authors also use numerical simulations to check the analytical results.

=== RESULTS/ DATA ===
The main results of the paper are as follows:
1. **Non-Equilibrium phase transition**: The authors find that a non-equilibrium phase transition can be induced by an external driving force and that the order parameter is not conserved in the stationary state, but it is a dynamical variable.
2. **Non-Equilibrium universality**: The authors show that the non-equilibrium phase transition has the same universal properties as the equilibrium one. In particular, the critical exponents are the same in both cases and the scaling functions are the same at the leading order.
3. **Non-Equilibrium finite-size effects**: The authors find that the non-equilibrium phase transition has the same finite-size effects as the equilibrium one. In particular, the shift and the rounding of the specific heat capacity peak at the critical point are the same in both cases.

=== LIMITATIONS/DISCUSSION ===
The main limitations of this paper are the following:
1. **Mean-field theory**: The authors use a mean-field theory to study the active emulsion systems. This is an approximation and it should be noted that there could be corrections due to the fluctuations.
2. **Numerical simulations**: The authors use numerical simulations to check the analytical results, but they are not able to perform the high order numerical calculations.
3. **Theoretical framework**: The authors do not discuss the theoretical framework of the mean-field theory and the numerical method in detail.
