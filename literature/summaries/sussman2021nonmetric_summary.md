**Overview/Summary**
The paper by Sussman et al. presents a new set of non-metric interaction rules for models of active matter that can be used to study the dynamics of biological cells. The authors use the Delaunay tessellation, a well-known geometric object, as a proxy for the cell membrane and show how the topological properties of the Delaunay tesselation are related to the physical properties of the cell. They also present a new set of non-metric interaction rules that can be used in models of active matter to study the dynamics of biological cells. The authors use the Delaunay tessellation as a proxy for the cell membrane and show how the topological properties of the Delaunay tesselation are related to the physical properties of the cell. They also present a new set of non-metric interaction rules that can be used in models of active matter to study the dynamics of biological cells.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The authors find that the number of edges, $N$, is a good proxy for the area of the Delaunay tesselation. They also find that the average degree, $\langle k \rangle$, is a good proxy for the perimeter of the Delaunay tesselation. The authors use these new metrics to study the dynamics of biological cells and show how the topological properties of the Delaunay tesselation are related to the physical properties of the cell. They also present a new set of non-metric interaction rules that can be used in models of active matter to study the dynamics of biological cells.

**Methodology/Approach**
The authors use the Delaunay tessellation, a well-known geometric object, as a proxy for the cell membrane and show how the topological properties of the Delaunay tesselation are related to the physical properties of the cell. The authors also present a new set of non-metric interaction rules that can be used in models of active matter to study the dynamics of biological cells.

**Results/Data**
The authors find that the number of edges, $N$, is a good proxy for the area of the Delaunay tesselation. They also find that the average degree, $\langle k \rangle$, is a good proxy for the perimeter of the Delaunay tesselation. The authors use these new metrics to study the dynamics of biological cells and show how the topological properties of the Delaunay tesselation are related to the physical properties of the cell. They also present a new set of non-metric interaction rules that can be used in models of active matter to study the dynamics of biological cells.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The authors note that their work is limited by the fact that the Delaunay tesselation is not a perfect proxy for the cell membrane. The authors also point out that the physical properties of the cell are not perfectly correlated with the topological properties of the Delaunay tesselation. The authors suggest that the non-metric interaction rules they present could be used in models of active matter to study the dynamics of biological cells.
