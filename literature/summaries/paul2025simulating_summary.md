**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Simulating Biological Intelligence: Active Inference with Experimentation" by Aswin Paul, Takuya Isomura, and Adeel Razi presents a novel approach to simulate biological intelligence using the active inference (AI) framework. The authors demonstrate that AI can be used in an embodied environment where the agent is not only learning from observations but also actively influencing the world through its actions. This is achieved by introducing an experiment design into the generative model, which allows for the exploration of a wide range of possible worlds and the selection of the one that best fits the data. The paper focuses on the active inference with discrete state-spaces and provides a theoretical synthesis of the approach. The authors also compare their method to other approaches in the literature.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this work are the introduction of an experiment design into the generative model, the development of the theoretical framework for the AI on the discrete state-space, and the comparison with the existing methods. The paper demonstrates that the proposed approach can be used to simulate biological intelligence by allowing the agent to learn from its observations as well as actively influence the world through its actions. This is in contrast to the traditional approaches where the agent only learns from its observations without any control over the environment.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use a generative model for the AI, which is based on the free energy principle (FEP). The FEP states that the brain minimizes the difference between the current state and the optimal state. The optimal state is the one where the agent has the maximum amount of information about its environment. This is achieved by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, which is a measure of the information gain from the current to the optimal state. The FEP is used in the context of the generative model that includes both the observation and the action models. The authors also use the variational inference for the AI. The variational inference is based on the KL divergence between the true distribution and the approximate distribution. The variational lower bound, which is the free energy, is minimized to obtain the optimal parameters of the generative model. The authors compare their approach with the existing methods that are based on the FEP and the variational inference.

**Results/Data**

The paper presents a theoretical analysis of the proposed method. It also compares the proposed approach with the existing approaches in the literature. The results show that the proposed approach can be used to simulate biological intelligence by allowing the agent to learn from its observations as well as actively influence the world through its actions. This is in contrast to the traditional approaches where the agent only learns from its observations without any control over the environment.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors mention that the proposed method can be extended in several ways, including the development of a more sophisticated generative model and the use of the branching time AI for the continuous state-space. The paper also mentions that the theoretical analysis is limited to the discrete state-spaces and the future work should focus on the continuous case.
