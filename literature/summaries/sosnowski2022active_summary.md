**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Active TLS Stack Fingerprinting: Characterizing TLS Deployment" by [Authors] is a research study that focuses on the characterization of TLS (Transport Layer Security) deployment and its evolution over time. The authors aim to provide an in-depth analysis of the current state of TLS, which is a widely used protocol for secure communication between clients and servers. They use active fingerprinting techniques to collect data from the Internet and analyze it to understand how TLS has been deployed on the web. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of TLS and its evolution over time.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this study are the development of an active TLS stack fingerprinting (ATLSF) system, which is used to collect data from the Internet, and the analysis of the collected data. The authors use a knowledge base called Censys.io that contains information about the TLS deployment on the web. The ATLSF system is based on the Goscanner tool, which can be used to fingerprint the TLS version in use by a server. The paper also provides an overview of the current state of TLS and its evolution over time.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors first develop an active TLS stack fingerprinting (ATLSF) system that is based on the Goscanner tool, which can be used to fingerprint the TLS version in use by a server. The ATLSF system is then used to collect data from the Internet and analyze it to understand how TLS has been deployed on the web. The authors also provide an overview of the current state of TLS and its evolution over time.

**Results/Data**

The results show that the TLS 1.3 protocol version has become the most widely used protocol version in recent years, which is a significant change from the previous years. The paper provides an overview of the current state of TLS and its evolution over time. The authors also provide some statistics about the TLS deployment on the web.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The limitations of this study are that it does not consider the knowledge base Censys.io, which is used to collect data from the Internet. It only provides an overview of the current state of TLS and its evolution over time. The authors also mention some future work directions in the paper.

**Additional Material**

The additional material section of the paper provides more details about the ATLSF system and Censys.io, which are used to collect data from the Internet and analyze it.
