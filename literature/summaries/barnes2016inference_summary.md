**Overview/Summary**

The paper presents a two-fluid model of "hot" nano-flare trains in active region (AR) cores and investigates how different models for the nano-flare energy distribution and timing as well as preferential heating of di?erent species affect the emission measure distribution. The authors ?nd that if the peak of the emission measure occurs at Tm, then Tm and EM(Tm) are independent of the properties of the nano-?are train and which species was heated. As a consequence, they demonstrate that the form of EM( T) on either side of Tm re?ects di?erent aspects of the heating process. Below Tm, the principle factor in determining EM( T) is the presence of a waiting time between nano-?ares: the high densities below Tm mean that species temperature equilibration has occurred so that no information about which species was heated remains. Above Tm, higher temperatures arise when a power-law distribution of energy is assumed than for a nano-?are train with uniform heating rates. However, no information about the presence of a waiting time survives. Higher observed temperatures also arise for the single-?uid and electron heating cases where a "hot shoulder" can occur in EM( T) at T ∼ 10 MK. This is compared to the ion heating case where a ?nite equilibration time means that the electrons are heated more slowly.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors show that the well-known relation EM ∝ T^a was quite robust below Tm, but not above it. On the other hand, the calculation of a ratio between the emission measure at a pair of temperatures above and below Tm held more promise. For a wide range of parameters the ratio of the emission measure at two temperatures, Thot = 10 6.942 >Tm and Tcool = 10 6.187 < Tm, was of order unity, consistent with Brosius et al. (2014) within the uncertainties in the measurements. The authors also ?nd that the form of EM( T) on either side of Tm re?ects di?erent aspects of the heating process. Below Tm, higher temperatures arise when a power-law distribution of energy is assumed than for a nano-?are train with uniform heating rates. However, no information about the presence of a waiting time survives. Higher observed temperatures also arise for the single-?uid and electron heating cases where a "hot shoulder" can occur in EM( T) at T ∼ 10 MK. This is compared to the ion heating case where a ?nite equilibration time means that the electrons are heated more slowly.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use a two-?uid model of nano-?are trains in AR cores and consider a range of models for the nano-?are energy distribution and timing as well as preferential heating of di?erent species. For each set of parameters, they generate the emission measure distribution as a function of temperature. If the peak of the emission measure occurs at Tm, then the authors ?nd that Tm and EM(Tm) were independent of the properties of the nano-?are train and which species was heated. As a consequence, they demonstrate that the form of EM( T) on either side of Tm re?ects di?erent aspects of the heating process. Below Tm, the principle factor in determining EM( T) is the presence of a waiting time between nano-?ares: the high densities below Tm mean that species temperature equilibration has occurred so that no information about which species was heated remains. Above Tm, higher temperatures arise when a power-law distribution of energy is assumed than for a nano-?are train with uniform heating rates. However, no information about the presence of a waiting time survives. Higher observed temperatures also arise for the single-?uid and electron heating cases where a "hot shoulder" can occur in EM( T) at T ∼ 10 MK. This is compared to the ion heating case where a ?nite equilibration time means that the electrons are heated more slowly.

**Results/Data**

The authors show that the ratio of the emission measure at two temperatures, Thot = 10 6.942 >Tm and Tcool = 10 6.187 < Tm, was of order unity for a wide range of parameters, consistent with Brosius et al. (2014) within the uncertainties in the measurements.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors ?rst note that while below Tm the well-known relation EM ∝ T^a was quite robust, that was not the case above it. On the other hand the calculation of a ratio between the emission measure at a pair of temperatures above and below Tm held more promise. For a wide range of parameters the ratio of the emission measure at two temperatures above and below Tm held within the uncertainties in the measurements. The authors also ?nd that the form of EM( T) on either side of Tm re?ects di?erent aspects of the heating process. Below Tm, higher temperatures arise when a power-law distribution of energy is assumed than for a nano-?are train with uniform heating rates. However, no information about the presence of a waiting time survives. Higher observed temperatures also arise for the single-?uid and electron heating cases where a "hot shoulder" can occur in EM( T) at T ∼ 10 MK. This is compared to the ion heating case where a ?nite equilibration time means that the electrons are heated more slowly.

**Additional Line Pairs**

The authors also consider the mean emission measure ratio as a function of tN for three additional line pairs: Fe XIX/Fe XII, Fe XX/Fe XII, and Fe XX/Fe XV. The formation temperatures of Fe XV and Fe XX, calculated using CHIANTI v8, are 10 6.342 K and 10 7.027 K, respectively. The circles (stars) correspond to β = 0(1) and we consider only α = −2.5 here. The values of the line ratios can be organized from high to low as Fe XIX/Fe XII, Fe XX/Fe XII, Fe XIX/Fe XV, and Fe XX/Fe XV. The second and third pairs have similar ratio values. This ordering is to be expected from the general shape of the EM( T) curves, although the exact ratios cannot be predicted in any simple way. For β = 1, the ratio decreases monotonically as tN decreases, however the values of the ratio lie within a narrow band. The relative ratios of line pairs are a quantitative prediction that can be examined were such data to be available, and can be easily extended to other line pairs not considered here. In addition, for all line pairs, the detection of an emission measure ratio lying between the upper and lower bounds shown can be regarded as a very strong indicator of the presence of "hot" nano-?are-produced plasma. Further deductions require more detailed modeling of in particular the atomic physics which is beyond the scope of this paper.
