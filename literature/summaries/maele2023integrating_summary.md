**Overview/Summary**
The paper "Integrating cognitive map learning and active inference for planning" by Van de Maele et al. (2022) [1] is a multidisciplinary work that combines insights from cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and computer science to tackle the problem of how we plan our actions in the world. The authors present an integrated framework for this problem based on the principles of active inference, which they describe as "a process theory" [6]. They start by discussing the role of the hippocampus in planning and spatial memory, then move on to the problem of building a cognitive map, and finally discuss how their proposed approach can be used for planning. The paper is written in an accessible style that makes it easy to follow along.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The main contribution of this work is the development of a novel framework for planning based on active inference [6]. This is achieved by integrating two separate approaches: cognitive map learning and active inference. The authors first discuss how the hippocampus, which is often referred to as "the brain's GPS," can be thought of as a cognitive map that supports spatial memory. They then describe how this cognitive map is built through the process of generalization [4]. Next, they present their approach for planning based on active inference and show how it can be used in a simple gridworld environment. The authors also discuss some limitations of their work.

**Methodology/Approach**
The authors start by discussing the role of the hippocampus in spatial memory and how this is related to the problem of building a cognitive map. They then present an integrated framework for planning based on active inference [6]. This is achieved by integrating two separate approaches: cognitive map learning and active inference. The first part of the paper is written as an introduction, which provides context for the rest of the work. The second part of the paper presents the authors' approach to building a cognitive map. The third part of the paper discusses how this framework can be used in a simple gridworld environment.

**Results/Data**
The results section of the paper describes how the authors' integrated framework is used in a simple gridworld environment. This is done by first discussing an example problem, then describing their approach to planning based on active inference [6]. Next, they describe how this can be applied to the gridworld. The final part of the paper discusses some limitations and future work.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The authors discuss some limitations of their work in the discussion section. They also mention that there is no one-size-fits-all approach for building a cognitive map and that different approaches may be more or less suitable depending on the specific problem being tackled. The final part of the paper mentions future work.
