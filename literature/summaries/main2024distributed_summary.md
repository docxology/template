**Overview/Summary**

The paper presents a distributed quantum computing (DQC) architecture across an optical network link (ONL). The authors demonstrate that DQC is feasible and efficient for the first time by using a single-photon source, a superconducting qubit (SQ), and a photonic device to generate entangled photon pairs. The ONL is composed of two nodes separated by 33 km, which are connected through an optical fiber link. This architecture can be used as a building block for the large-scale quantum network.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors propose a DQC protocol based on the photonic device and demonstrate it in the first experiment. The key contributions of this work are:
1. The authors design a high-fidelity entangling gate between two logical qubits, which is used to teleport an arbitrary single-qubit quantum state from one node to another.
2. The authors realize the DQC protocol with the photonic device and demonstrate it in the first experiment. This experiment shows that the DQC is feasible for the first time.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors propose a DQC protocol based on the photonic device. The ONL consists of two nodes separated by 33 km, which are connected through an optical fiber link. In this work, the authors use a single-photon source to generate entangled photon pairs and an SQ as the target qubit. The photonic device is used to generate the entangled photons.

**Results/Data**

The experiment results show that the DQC protocol can be realized with high fidelity. The experimental data are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions. The authors also compare the performance of the DQC protocol based on the photonic device and the previous one based on the spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) process. The results demonstrate that the DQC protocol is more efficient than the previous one.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The paper does not discuss the limitations or future work in detail, but it can be summarized as follows:
1. The authors do not mention the possibility of using a single-photon source to generate entangled photon pairs.
2. The authors do not compare the performance of the DQC protocol based on the photonic device and the previous one based on the SPDC process in detail. The comparison is only mentioned briefly in the paper.
