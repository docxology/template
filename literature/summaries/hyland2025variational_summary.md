**Overview/Summary**

The paper "On the Variational Costs of Changing Our Minds" by D. Hyland and M. Albarracin (2023) presents a theoretical framework for understanding how people's beliefs change in response to new evidence, with a focus on the costs associated with changing their minds. The authors argue that this process is not just about updating one's prior belief, but also involves a form of "mental effort" or cognitive work that is often overlooked in traditional Bayesian models of decision-making. This mental effort can be understood as an information-theoretic cost that is incurred when the mind is updated with new evidence, and the authors argue that this cost is not just a minor detail but rather a fundamental aspect of how people make decisions. The paper reviews the current state-of-the-art in understanding motivated reasoning, which refers to the process by which people's beliefs are changed in response to new information. In particular, it provides an overview of the "thermodynamic" perspective on decision-making that has been developed over the past few decades, and how this perspective can be used to understand the motivated reasoning phenomenon. The authors also provide a brief review of the current state-of-the-art in understanding the motivated reasoning phenomenon.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contribution of the paper is the development of a new theoretical framework for understanding the costs associated with changing one's mind, which they call "variational costs." This is based on the idea that when people are presented with evidence that challenges their prior beliefs, it can be costly to update those beliefs. The authors argue that this process is not just about updating one's prior belief, but also involves a form of "mental effort" or cognitive work that is often overlooked in traditional Bayesian models of decision-making. This mental effort can be understood as an information-theoretic cost that is incurred when the mind is updated with new evidence, and the authors argue that this cost is not just a minor detail but rather a fundamental aspect of how people make decisions. The paper also provides a brief review of the current state-of-the-art in understanding motivated reasoning, which refers to the process by which people's beliefs are changed in response to new information.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors argue that this mental effort or cognitive work can be understood as an information-theoretic cost. The authors also provide a brief review of the current state-of-the-art in understanding motivated reasoning, which refers to the process by which people's beliefs are changed in response to new information.

**Results/Data**

The authors present a number of results and findings from their own research that is relevant to this topic. First, they show how the "thermodynamic" perspective on decision-making can be used to understand motivated reasoning. Second, they argue that the current state-of-the-art in understanding motivated reasoning is not just about the process by which people's beliefs are changed in response to new information, but also includes a number of other related processes such as confirmation bias and selective exposure. Third, they discuss how this perspective can be used to understand the motivated reasoning phenomenon.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors present a number of limitations and future research directions that are relevant to this topic. First, the authors argue that there is still much to learn about the "thermodynamic" perspective on decision-making. Second, they suggest that the current state-of-the-art in understanding motivated reasoning can be used as a starting point for further research.

**References**

The references provided by the authors are relevant to this topic. The first reference is to a paper by Ortega and Braun (2013) that provides an overview of the "thermodynamic" perspective on decision-making, which includes a number of other related processes such as confirmation bias and selective exposure. The second reference is to a paper by Simon (1964) that provides a general framework for understanding how people make decisions under conditions where there are significant information-processing costs.

**Summary**

The authors present a comprehensive review of the current state-of-the-art in understanding motivated reasoning, which refers to the process by which people's beliefs are changed in response to new information. The paper also presents a number of other related processes that are relevant to this topic.
