**Overview/Summary**

The paper is concerned with the unitary representation theory of locally compact contraction groups. The authors describe a method for constructing all the irreducible representations of such a group G, and in particular, all the factor representations of G, from those of one of the groups Gπ (π∈ˆN). This is done by first describing the Mackey little group method for ordinary unitary representations, and then generalising this to when multiplier representations are necessary. The authors also give a simple condition on the groups G and N which implies that N is regularly embedded in G.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main results of the paper are the following two theorems. First, the authors describe the Mackey little group method for ordinary unitary representations. This is done by stating the deﬁnition of quasi-inequivalence of unitary representations and then describing the Mackey little group method in this context. The important fact that one must know is that if Gis a locally compact separable group and N a closed normal type I regularly embedded subgroup of G, then the quasi-orbit of every factor representation is concentrated in a single orbit. Thus, in this case, every factor representation of G, and in particular, every irreducible representation of G, can be constructed from a representation of one of the groups Gπ (π∈ˆN) via the method described in Theorem 2.31. The authors also give a simple condition on the groups G and N which implies that N is regularly embedded in G.

**Methodology/Approach**

The Mackey little group method for ordinary unitary representations is described by stating the deﬁnition of quasi-inequivalence of unitary representations, and then describing the Mackey little group method. The important fact that one must know is that if Gis a locally compact separable group and N a closed normal type I regularly embedded subgroup of G, then the quasi-orbit of every factor representation is concentrated in a single orbit. Thus, in this case, every factor representation of G, and in particular, every irreducible representation of G, can be constructed from a representation of one of the groups Gπ (π∈ˆN) via the method described in Theorem 2.31.
