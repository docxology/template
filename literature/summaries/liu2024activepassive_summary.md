**Overview/Summary**

The paper "A Survey on Vertical Federated Learning: From a Layered Perspective" by Liu et al. (2023) provides an overview of the current state of the art in vertical federated learning, which is a subfield of federated learning that focuses on training a shared model across multiple parties with different local data distributions. The authors identify three types of vertical federated learning: 1) horizontal partitioning; 2) vertical partitioning; and 3) heterogeneous partitioning. In the first type, all clients have the same feature set but different labels. In the second type, each client has a different feature set but the same label. The third type is more general, where both the feature sets and the labels are different across parties. This paper reviews the existing works in these three types of vertical federated learning from a layered perspective.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors first review the existing works on horizontal partitioning, which is the most common type of vertical federated learning. They then discuss the existing works on vertical and heterogeneous partitioning. The authors also compare the existing methods in these three types of vertical federated learning from a layered perspective. The paper provides an overview of the current state of the art in vertical federated learning.

**Methodology/Approach**
