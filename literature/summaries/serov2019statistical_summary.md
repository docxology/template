**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Statistical Tests for Force Inference in Heterogeneous Media" by Holcman et al. (2019) is a theoretical work that addresses the problem of inferring the force acting on an individual particle from its motion, when the environment is heterogeneous and the noise is not additive. The authors consider the case where the noise is multiplicative, which can be caused by the presence of other particles in the system. In this situation, the Itô-Stratonovich (IS) transformation is no longer valid as a first order expansion in the noise amplitude. The authors show that the standard method of using the Stratonovich (S) transformation to obtain the effective drift and diffusion coefficients for the multiplicative case is not correct. They also propose a new method based on the effective drift and diffusion, which they call "inferenceMAP", where the parameters are estimated by Bayesian inference. The authors test their approach in two different models of the motion: one with a single force acting on the particle, and another with a multiplicative noise caused by the presence of other particles. In both cases, the authors compare the results of the standard method based on the S transformation to the results of the IS transformation. The authors also compare the results of the inferenceMAP approach to the results of the S transformation in the case where the noise is additive.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this paper are the development and testing of a new statistical test for force inference, which they call "inferenceMAP", that can be used when the environment is heterogeneous. The authors show that the standard method based on the S transformation is not correct in the case where the noise is multiplicative. They also compare the results of the inferenceMAP approach to the results of the S transformation in the case where the noise is additive.

**Methodology/Approach**

The paper starts with a discussion of the two different methods for the IS and S transformations, which are both first order approximations in the limit of small noise. The authors then describe their new method based on the effective drift and diffusion coefficients. The inferenceMAP approach is to use Bayesian inference to estimate the parameters from the data. They also compare the results of the inferenceMAP approach with the results of the S transformation in the case where the noise is additive.

**Results/Data**

The paper presents numerical tests for both the single force model and the multiplicative noise model. The authors find that the standard method based on the S transformation does not give the correct effective drift and diffusion coefficients when the noise is multiplicative, but the inferenceMAP approach gives a good estimate of the parameters in this case.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The paper concludes with a discussion of the limitations of the results. The authors state that the standard method based on the S transformation can be used to obtain the effective drift and diffusion coefficients when the noise is additive, but not in the multiplicative case. They also state that the inferenceMAP approach can be used for both the single force model and the multiplicative noise model.
