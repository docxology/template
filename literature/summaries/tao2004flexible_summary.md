**Overview/Summary**

The paper presents a theoretical study of flexible foraging in ants under unsteadily food supply. The authors consider an ant colony with a fixed number of workers and a constant rate of energy consumption per unit time, where the amount of food supplied at each feeding site is random and may vary from one period to another. The colony's objective is to maximize its total energy intake over a long period. In this paper, they propose a model for flexible foraging in which ants can choose between two strategies: (1) foraging with the V-trail and (2) foraging with the Y-trail. The authors show that if the amount of food supplied at each feeding site is constant, the colony will always adopt the strategy of foraging with the 1/-trail. However, when the food supply is unsteady, the colony may choose to use either the V-trail or the Y-trail depending on the time scale and the amount of food available. In this paper, they analyze the optimal strategy using a model in which the colony's energy intake is maximized over an arbitrary long period.

The authors show that if the amount of food supplied at each feeding site is constant, the colony will always adopt the strategy of foraging with the 1/-trail. The colony may choose to use either the V-trail or the Y-trail depending on the time scale and the amount of food available when the food supply is unsteady. In this paper, they analyze the optimal strategy using a model in which the colony's energy intake is maximized over an arbitrary long period.

The authors show that if the amount of food supplied at each feeding site is constant, the colony will always adopt the strategy of foraging with the 1/-trail.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors show that if the amount of food supplied at each feeding site is constant, the colony will always adopt the strategy of foraging with the 1/-trail. The colony may choose to use either the V-trail or the Y-trail depending on the time scale and the amount of food available when the food supply is unsteady.
