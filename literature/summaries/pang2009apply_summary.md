**Overview/Summary**

The paper proposes a novel algorithm for searching all extreme points of a function in a given search space. Extreme points are local maxima or minima that have the same value and are not global extrema. The authors consider two types of problems, namely, finding all local maxima (local minima) and finding all local minima (local maxima). In the first type, the function is only required to be continuous on the search space. In the second type, the function is also required to be differentiable at each extreme point. The authors use the ant colony algorithm (ACA), which is a probabilistic iterative optimization method inspired by the foraging behavior of ants. They compare their ACA with the well-known exhaustive search and the genetic algorithm in terms of efficiency. Their experimental results show that the proposed ACA can find all local maxima (minima) in an efficient way, but it may not work well for finding all local minima (maxima). The authors also discuss the reasons why the second type is more difficult than the first one.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this paper are as follows. First, the authors propose a novel algorithm based on the ACA to find all extreme points in a given search space. Second, they compare their proposed ACA with the exhaustive search and the genetic algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed ACA can find all local maxima in an efficient way, but it may not work well for finding all local minima.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use the ant colony optimization (ACO) to solve the problem of searching all extreme points. The ACO is a probabilistic iterative optimization method inspired by the foraging behavior of ants. In the first type, the function is only required to be continuous on the search space. In the second type, the function is also required to be differentiable at each extreme point. The authors use the ACA to find all local maxima (minima) and compare it with the genetic algorithm in terms of efficiency.

**Results/Data**

The experimental results show that the proposed ACA can find all local maxima in an efficient way, but it may not work well for finding all local minima. The reasons why the second type is more difficult than the first one are discussed.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors also discuss the limitations of their algorithm and future work. They mention that the proposed ACA can only find some extreme points in a given search space, but it cannot guarantee to find all extreme points. The authors also suggest that the second type is more difficult than the first one. In this paper, the authors only consider the two-dimensional case. However, the algorithm can be extended to the higher dimensional case.
