**Overview/Summary**

The paper presents an online decision-making framework for Pareto-Optimal problems with incomplete information. The authors consider a multi-objective Markov Decision Process (MDP) where the reward function is unknown and can be any convex set in the objective space, and propose an active inference (AIF) method to select a single action that is close to the optimal one. In this setting, the goal is to find the Pareto-Optimal solution, which is the best trade-off between the objectives. The main contributions of the paper are the AIF selection algorithm for the MDP and its application in the multi-agent scenario.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The AIF method is based on the active inference principle that a good estimate of the model can be used to select an action, which is close to the optimal one. The authors first show that the existing algorithms are myopic because they do not consider the uncertainty in the transition cost function and the preference distribution simultaneously. Then, the AIF method is proposed based on the idea of active inference. In this paper, the authors use a linear scalarization as the preference, which means that the user can specify a desired point in the objective space. The AIF algorithm is based on the principle that the first term in (7) dominates the selection when the estimate plan ˜Π⋆ is informed and the second term in (7) dominates the selection when the estimate plan ˜Π⋆ is uninformed. In this paper, the authors use a linear scalarization as the preference, which means that the user can specify a desired point in the objective space. The AIF algorithm is based on the principle that the first term in (7) dominates the selection when the estimate plan ˜Π⋆ is informed and the second term in (7) dominates the selection when the estimate plan ˜Π⋆ is uninformed. In this paper, the authors use a linear scalarization as the preference, which means that the user can specify a desired point in the objective space.

**Methodology/Approach**

The AIF method is based on the principle of active inference. The first term in (7) dominates the selection when the estimate plan ˜Π⋆ is informed and the second term in (7) dominates the selection when the estimate plan ˜Π⋆ is uninformed. In this paper, the authors use a linear scalarization as the preference, which means that the user can specify a desired point in the objective space.

**Results/Data**

The first term in (7) dominates the selection when the estimate plan ˜Π⋆ is informed and the second term in (7) dominates the selection when the estimate plan ˜Π⋆ is uninformed. In this paper, the authors use a linear scalarization as the preference, which means that the user can specify a desired point in the objective space.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The AIF method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of both cumulative regrets and biases when the size of variance is not too large. The remaining methods converge to a non-constant slope cumulative bias, indicating that portions of the Pareto front have not been properly learned.
