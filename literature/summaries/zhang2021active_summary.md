**Overview/Summary**

The paper compares and contrasts two types of RIS (Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface) systems for wireless communication networks, namely active RIS and passive RIS. The main contributions of the paper are that it proposes a novel algorithm to optimize the transmit beamforming vector in an active RIS system and analyzes the convergence and computational complexity of the proposed algorithm by comparing with the existing one. In addition, the authors also propose a self-optimizing method for the power scaling factor in the passive RIS system.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions are that the paper proposes a novel algorithm to optimize the transmit beamforming vector in an active RIS system and analyzes the convergence and computational complexity of the proposed algorithm by comparing with the existing one. In addition, the authors also propose a self-optimizing method for the power scaling factor in the passive RIS system.

**Methodology/Approach**

The paper first proposes a novel algorithm to optimize the transmit beamforming vector in an active RIS system and analyzes the convergence and computational complexity of the proposed algorithm by comparing with the existing one. In addition, the authors also propose a self-optimizing method for the power scaling factor in the passive RIS system.

**Results/Data**

The paper shows that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing one in terms of the transmit beamforming vector optimization and the convergence speed is faster than the existing one. The authors also show that the proposed self-optimizing method can achieve a better performance than the existing one for the power scaling factor in the passive RIS system.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The paper does not discuss the limitations of the proposed algorithm, but it shows the potential and future work directions.
