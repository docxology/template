**Overview/Summary**

The paper presents a series of online workshops and hackathons for Spanish speakers to promote quantum computing (QC) education and outreach in the Latin American region. The first workshop was held on 2021-01-28, followed by a second one on 2022-02-25. The hackathon took place from 2021-11-19 to 2021-12-03. The organizers of this paper are the same as those for the two workshops and the hackathon. The main goal is to provide an opportunity for Spanish speakers to learn about QC, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors make several contributions: (1) they organize a series of online events that are free from language barriers; (2) they use Qiskit as the main tool for these events; and (3) they provide an opportunity to learn about QC in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The organizers also make some suggestions for future work.
