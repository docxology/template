**Overview/Summary**

The Great Inequality (GI) is a near-commensurability in the Jupiter-Saturn 2:5 mean motion that has been recognized as problematic from the beginnings of perturbation theory. The problems are due to the so-called Great Inequality, which is the Jupiter-Saturn 2:5 mean-motion near-commensurability. Brouwer and Van Woerkom (1950) included some extra terms in their expansions, trying to account for the effects of the GI. We wanted to test our theory on this undoubtedly difficult case, and were interested in any signs of nonconvergence. Alternately, in the case of apparent convergence, one would like to know the appropriate truncation of the expansions.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The paper presents a fully analytic Hamiltonian planetary theory that is based on the ideas of Message (1959); it is analytic and fully Hamiltonian. The authors' theory follows the ideas of Message; it is analytic and fully Hamiltonian.

**Methodology/Approach**

The paper presents a fully analytic Hamiltonian planetary theory that is based on the ideas of Message (1959); it is analytic and fully Hamiltonian. The authors' theory follows the ideas of Message; it is analytic and fully Hamiltonian. The authors use a Hamiltonian formulation to study the long-term behavior of the solar system, which is the subject of the paper.

**Results/Data**

The authors perform a series of numerical integrations for the Sun-Jupiter-Saturn system that extend to the third order in the masses and to the 8th degree in the eccentricities and inclinations. The results are presented as a function of time. The main result is an unexpectedly sensitive dependence of the solution on initial data, which is likely nonconvergence. The source of the sensitivity and apparent lack of convergence is this near-commensurability, the so-called Great Inequality. This indicates that simple averaging, still common in current semi-analytic planetary theories, may not be an adequate technique to obtain information on the long-term dynamics of the solar system. Preliminary results suggest that these difficulties can be overcome by using resonant normal forms.
