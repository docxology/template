**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Bayesian Inference on Volatility in the Presence of Noise" by [Authors] is a study that proposes a novel method to correct the misspecified posterior distribution for the parameter of interest when it is estimated from noisy data. The authors propose a new Bayesian inference approach, which can be used to estimate the parameter and its uncertainty simultaneously. This paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we introduce the model and the problem that this paper addresses. Section 3 describes the misspecified posterior distribution. Section 4 presents the main results of the paper. The method proposed in this paper is based on a new Bayesian inference approach. The details of the new method are given in Section 5. In Section 6, we provide some numerical examples to illustrate the performance of the proposed method.
