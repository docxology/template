=== KEY CONTRIBUTIONS/ FINDINGS ===

The authors propose a novel approach to active neural sensing and planning for unknown cluttered environments. This is achieved by using a robot to capture images of an environment, then use a neural network to infer the shape of the objects in the scene from these images. The paper's main contributions are:
1. A new method for active neural sensing that can be used in unknown cluttered environments.
2. An approach for planning the next viewpoint based on the inferred object shapes.

The authors' approach is based on a novel scene registration method, which uses a neural network to register the observed images into the same coordinate system and then use the shape completion module to infer the shape of the objects from the aggregated images. The paper's main findings are:
1. The proposed active sensing and planning approach can be used in unknown cluttered environments.
2. The proposed active sensing and planning approach is more efficient than the baseline methods.
