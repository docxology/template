**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Narrative as active inference: an integrative account of narrative and self" by McAdams et al (2018) is a comprehensive review on the role of narratives in the process of self-formation, which is a central problem in psychology. The authors argue that the traditional view of the self as a fixed entity with a clear boundary between the internal and external world does not account for the dynamic and adaptive nature of the human experience. Instead, they propose an active inference approach to the self, where the self is seen as an integrative process that involves the construction and reconstruction of narratives about oneself. The authors present a narrative identity theory based on this view, which posits that the self is not fixed but rather dynamic and adaptive. They argue that the self is constructed through the creation and maintenance of a coherent narrative account of one's life, and that this process involves both creative and conservative processes.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors present several key findings in their paper, including the following: (1) The self is not fixed but rather dynamic and adaptive. This means that the self can be changed through the creation and maintenance of a coherent narrative account of one's life. (2) The process of self-formation involves both creative and conservative processes. The authors argue that this view of the self as an active inference process provides a new perspective on the traditional views of the self, which is seen as a fixed entity with a clear boundary between the internal and external world. This means that the self can be changed through the creation and maintenance of a coherent narrative account of one's life. (3) The authors present a theory of the self based on this active inference view, which they call the "narrative identity" theory. They argue that this new perspective provides a more comprehensive understanding of the process of self-formation.

**Methodology/Approach**

The paper is a review and presents no original data or methods. The authors present an integrative account based on existing research in psychology, philosophy, and anthropology. The authors' approach to the topic is to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge in this area and to identify gaps that need to be filled by future research.

**Results/Data**

The paper does not report any original data or results. Instead, it provides a comprehensive review of existing research on the role of narratives in the process of self-formation. The authors present an overview of the current state of knowledge in this area and identify gaps that need to be filled by future research. They also provide a theoretical framework for understanding the process of self-formation based on the active inference approach.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors do not discuss any limitations or weaknesses of their theory. The paper is a review, so it does not have an explicit discussion section. However, they do mention several gaps that need to be filled by future research. These include: (1) The authors argue that the process of self-formation is still not well understood and that there are many unanswered questions in this area. (2) There is a need for more longitudinal studies on the role of narratives in the process of self-formation. (3) More research needs to be conducted on the relationship between narrative identity and meaningfulness. The authors also argue that there is a need for more research on the role of cultural factors in the process of self-formation.
