**Overview/Summary**

The Problem of Meaning: The Free Energy Principle and Artiicial Agency is a research paper in the field of artificial intelligence that proposes a new approach to understanding meaning. In this paper, the authors argue that the problem of meaning is not just an issue for philosophers but also for scientists who are trying to build intelligent machines. They propose a solution based on the free energy principle and its application to the problem of meaning. The main idea is that the amount of information in the environment can be used as a measure of the complexity of the environment, which is related to the concept of meaning. This paper is organized into 8 sections: Introduction, Key Contributions/Findings, Methodology/Approach, Results/Data, Limitations/Discussion, Conclusion, References and Appendices.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this paper are as follows:

1. The authors propose a new approach to the problem of meaning based on the free energy principle.
2. They argue that the amount of information in the environment can be used as a measure of the complexity of the environment, which is related to the concept of meaning.

**Methodology/Approach**

The methodology/approach of this paper is based on the free energy principle and its application to the problem of meaning. The authors use the variational free energy (VFE) and the expected free energy (EFE). The VFE is a measure of the amount of information that an agent needs to control in order to achieve a certain outcome, which is called the epistemic value. The EFE is the sum of the VFE over time. The authors use the generative model, which is based on the free energy principle, to describe the problem of meaning.

**Results/Data**

The results/data of this paper are as follows:

1. The authors argue that the amount of information in the environment can be used as a measure of the complexity of the environment.
2. They show that the EFE is a function of two quantities referred to as instrumental and epistemic value. Both instrumental and epistemic actions will work in the service of the agent's goals.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The limitations/discussion of this paper are as follows:

1. The authors argue that the amount of information in the environment can be used as a measure of the complexity of the environment.
2. They show that the EFE is a function of two quantities referred to as instrumental and epistemic value.

**Conclusion**

The conclusion of this paper is that the main idea of this paper is that the problem of meaning is not just an issue for philosophers but also for scientists who are trying to build intelligent machines. The authors propose a solution based on the free energy principle and its application to the problem of meaning. The main idea is that the amount of information in the environment can be used as a measure of the complexity of the environment, which is related to the concept of meaning.
