**Overview/Summary**

This paper proposes a novel approach to self-improvement in language models (LMs) using active inference, which is an AI paradigm that has been shown to be effective for human and animal learning. The authors first provide a brief overview of the free energy principle (FEP), which is a mathematical framework for understanding how the brain works, and then describe the application of this approach in the context of LMs. They then present their main contributions: an active inference self-organizing multi-agent system that can train LMs to improve themselves based on feedback from human evaluators.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors propose a novel approach for training LMs, called "active inference," which is a mathematical framework for understanding how the brain works. The FEP is a mathematical framework for understanding how the brain works and has been shown to be effective for human and animal learning. This paper applies this approach in the context of LMs. They then present their main contributions: an active inference self-organizing multi-agent system that can train LMs to improve themselves based on feedback from human evaluators.
