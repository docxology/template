**Overview/Summary**
The paper presents a new method for learning low-dimensional dynamical operators from high-dimensional data. The authors consider the problem of learning a generalization of the Laplacian operator in the setting where the available measurements are only a few samples, and the dimensionality of the underlying dynamics is much lower than the number of samples. This is often the case in many applications such as image or video processing, where the data can be represented by a low-dimensional subspace of the high-dimensional space. The authors formulate this problem as an inverse problem for learning the Laplacian operator from the few measurements and show that it has a unique solution. They also provide a numerical method to solve the inverse problem, which is based on the idea of active subspace selection. The proposed method can be used in many applications such as image or video processing.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The authors first formulate this problem as an inverse problem for learning the Laplacian operator from the few measurements and show that it has a unique solution. They also provide a numerical method to solve the inverse problem, which is based on the idea of active subspace selection. The proposed method can be used in many applications such as image or video processing.

**Methodology/Approach**
The authors first formulate this problem as an inverse problem for learning the Laplacian operator from the few measurements and show that it has a unique solution. They also provide a numerical method to solve the inverse problem, which is based on the idea of active subspace selection. The proposed method can be used in many applications such as image or video processing.

**Results/Data**
The authors first present some experimental results for this new method. The results show that the proposed method can achieve an order reduction in the number of samples from the high-dimensional system to keep the noise- to-signal ratio low, which is important for the accuracy of the learning model. In addition, the proposed method can also reduce the estimated bias and the MSE of the predicted state further in time.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The authors compare the active operator inference with a traditional sample selection that queries the high-dimensional system equidistantly in time. The results show that the proposed method requires almost 3 times fewer queries to the high-dimensional system than the traditional one to achieve the same noise- to-signal ratio. In addition, the model learned through the active operator inference can also reduce the estimated bias and the MSE of the predicted state further in time.
