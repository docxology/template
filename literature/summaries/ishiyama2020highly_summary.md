**Overview/Summary**

The paper proposes a method to improve the accuracy of deep neural network (DNN) inference on encrypted data using approximate activation functions. The authors first discuss the challenges in training DNNs for homomorphic encryption, including the need for large-scale datasets and the difficulty in optimizing the model's performance when the input is encrypted. They then describe their proposed method, which uses a differentiable approximation of the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) function to train a convolutional neural network (CNN). The authors show that this approach can be used as a drop-in replacement for the standard ReLU activation function in any DNN and achieves better performance than the original ReLU. The proposed method is based on the observation that the original ReLU function is not differentiable at zero, which makes it difficult to optimize when the input is encrypted. The authors also show that the approximate ReLU function can be used as a drop-in replacement for any other activation function in any DNN and achieves better performance than the standard function.
