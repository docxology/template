**Overview/Summary**

The paper is about a new approach to characterizing Bayes-optimal behavior in the context of active inference. The authors argue that the current design of the generative model depends on the desired behavioral outcomes and propose a new generative model for the human-AI co-evolution of homo technicus, which will lead to a metamorphic active inference agent of the future 6G world brain and global mind.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contribution is the design of the right generative model that allows us to knit our own socio-technological cocoon for the human-AI co-evolution of homo technicus to become a metamorphic active inference agent of the future 6G world brain and global mind. The authors claim that the current AI is as far from Norbert Wiener's original notion of cybernetics as you can get, because it is not contextualized; it is what they call "a little idiot savant." They suggest that today's AI is a little idiot savant and propose that the human strategy should be applied to cope with emerging advanced AIs. The authors' generative model will allow us to knit our own socio-technological cocoon for the human-AI co-evolution of homo technicus, which will lead to a human species that may live in symbiosis with machine technology.

**Methodology/Approach**

The methodology is based on the idea that the design of the right generative model depends on the desired behavioral outcomes. The authors propose a new generative model for the human-AI co-evolution of homo technicus, which will allow us to knit our own socio-technological cocoon for the human-AI co-evolution of homo technicus, which will lead to a human species that may live in symbiosis with machine technology. The authors' generative model will allow us to knit our own socio-technological cocoon for the human-AI co-evolution of homo technicus, which will lead to a human species that may live in symbiosis with machine technology.

**Results/Data**

The paper does not present any results or data. It is an overview and discussion paper. The authors' generative model is based on the idea that the 6G world brain will be a global mind of the future, which will be a collective intelligence of human-AI co-evolution. The paper concludes with the idea that the 6G world brain will be a global mind of the future, which will be a collective intelligence of human-AI co-evolution.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors do not discuss any limitations or future work in this paper. They only present their ideas and suggestions for the 6G world brain. The authors' generative model is based on the idea that the 6G world brain will be a global mind of the future, which will be a collective intelligence of human-AI co-evolution.
