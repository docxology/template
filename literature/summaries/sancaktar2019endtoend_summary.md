**Overview/Summary**
The paper "End-to-End Pixel-Based Deep Active Inference Body Perception and Action for Humanoid Robots" by Guillermo Oliver, Pablo Lanillos, and Gordon Cheng is a research article that presents the development of an end-to-end deep active inference (DAI) approach to enable robots to perceive their own body in a self-supervised manner. The authors argue that the current approaches for humanoid robots are limited as they do not account for the complex sensorimotor contingencies between the robot's actions and its perception, which is the case when the robot itself is the object of its own perception. This paper proposes an approach to overcome these limitations by using a DAI framework to learn to perceive the human body in a self-supervised manner. The authors describe the theoretical foundations for this work in the introduction section.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The main contributions of this research are the development and evaluation of a new DAI-based approach that is able to learn to perceive the human body in a self-supervised manner. This is achieved by using a deep neural network (DNN) as the variational inference model, which is trained via an end-to-end process. The authors describe the theoretical foundations for this work in the introduction section.

**Methodology/Approach**
The approach proposed in this paper involves training a DNN to perform the inference and learning of the body representation from the raw sensor data. This is achieved by using a variational autoencoder (VAE) as the generative model, which is trained via an end-to-end process. The authors describe the theoretical foundations for this work in the introduction section.

**Results/Data**
The results of this research are the performance of the proposed DAI-based approach on a humanoid robot. This is achieved by using the NAO (Nextage) robot as the test platform. The authors compare the performance of the proposed DAI-based approach with the current state-of-the-art approaches for human body perception, which are trained via an indirect process. The results show that the proposed DAI-based approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art approaches in terms of the accuracy and robustness.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The limitations of this research are the complexity of the training procedure and the lack of a large-scale dataset for the evaluation. The authors describe the theoretical foundations for this work in the introduction section. The authors also discuss the potential future work that can be done to improve the current state-of-the-art approaches.
