**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Active Materials: Biological Benchmarks and Transport Limitations" by Jee et al. [1] provides a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of active materials, which are capable of self-sustaining mechanical work in response to external stimuli. The authors discuss the importance of biological systems as benchmarks for the development of artificial active materials. They also highlight the challenges and limitations that arise when applying the concepts from biology to synthetic materials. In particular, they focus on the role of transport processes in the dynamics of active materials.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The paper is organized around three main themes: (i) the importance of biological systems as a source of inspiration for the development of artificial active materials; (ii) the challenges that arise when applying the concepts from biology to synthetic materials; and (iii) the role of transport processes in the dynamics of active materials. The authors first discuss the importance of biological systems, such as muscle and cytoskeleton, as a source of inspiration for the development of artificial active materials. They also highlight the challenges that arise when applying the concepts from biology to synthetic materials. In particular, they focus on the role of transport processes in the dynamics of active materials.
