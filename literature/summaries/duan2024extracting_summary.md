**Overview/Summary**
The paper "On Extracting Thermal Parameters and Scenario in High- Energy Nuclear Collisions" by Sahoo et al. (2022) is a comprehensive study on the thermal parameters of high-energy nuclear collisions. The authors use the Tsallis distribution to extract the freeze-out temperature, $T_{\rm FO}$, and the non-extensive parameter, $q$, from the transverse momentum spectra of charged hadrons produced in the most central events of Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV. The paper also discusses the scenario of the system evolution in the framework of the multi-source thermal model (MSTM). In 

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The authors find that the $T_{\rm FO}$ and $q$ extracted from the transverse momentum spectra of charged hadrons in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV are independent of the centrality, which is a new finding compared to previous studies on the same topic. The authors also find that the MSTM can be used to describe the evolution of the system from the early stage to the late stage of the collision. In the framework of the MSTM, the $T_{\rm FO}$ and $q$ are extracted for each source in the scenario of a two-source model. The results show that the $T_{\rm FO}$ of the first source is higher than the second one, while the $q$ of the second source is larger than the first one. The study indicates that the MSTM can be used to describe the evolution of the system from the early stage to the late stage of the collision. This scenario also explains the centrality dependence of the $T_{\rm FO}$ and $q$. The authors find that the $T_{\rm FO}$ and $q$ extracted in this framework are independent of the centrality, which is a new finding compared to previous studies on the same topic.

**Methodology/Approach**
The authors use the Tsallis distribution to extract the freeze-out temperature, $T_{\rm FO}$, and the non-extensive parameter, $q$, from the transverse momentum spectra of charged hadrons produced in the most central events. The MSTM is used to describe the evolution of the system in the framework of a two-source model. The $T_{\rm FO}$ and $q$ are extracted for each source in this scenario.
