**Overview/Summary**

The paper presents a novel approach to mobile manipulation with active inference for long-term planning in complex environments. The authors propose an end-to-end framework that can learn from demonstrations and achieve the desired behaviors by learning task-level policies. This is achieved through a hierarchical abstraction of the task into sub-goals, which are then learned using a probabilistic model-based reasoning (PMBR) system. The PMBR system is used to guide the robot in the long-term planning process with the help of a navigation module that provides the robot with a global path and orientation towards the target goal. This paper also presents an end-to-end framework for learning task-level policies from demonstrations, which can be applied to complex manipulation tasks.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors present a novel approach to mobile manipulation by introducing active inference into the long-term planning process of the robot. The main contributions are:
- A hierarchical abstraction of the task into sub-goals that is learned using a probabilistic model-based reasoning (PMBR) system.
- An end-to-end framework for learning task-level policies from demonstrations, which can be applied to complex manipulation tasks.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use a PMBR system to guide the robot in the long-term planning process. The PMBR system is used to reason about the world and make decisions based on the probabilistic model of the environment. The PMBR system consists of an inference module that can be trained from demonstrations, a navigation module that provides the robot with a global path and orientation towards the target goal, and a set of whole-body skills for the mobile manipulator. The authors use a hierarchical abstraction to decompose the task into sub-goals. A probabilistic map is created based on the PMBR system. This allows the robot to reason about the world in the long-term planning process. The authors also propose an end-to-end framework that can learn from demonstrations and achieve the desired behaviors by learning task-level policies.

**Results/Data**

The results of this paper are:
- A probabilistic map is created based on the PMBR system.
- The PMBR system allows the robot to reason about the world in the long-term planning process. This enables the robot to make decisions that take into account the uncertainty and the complexity of the environment.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The limitations and future work are:
- The authors do not discuss how the parameters for the collision avoidance strategy are chosen.
- The authors do not discuss how the PMBR system is used in the long-term planning process. This is an important aspect of this paper, as it is a key contribution.
