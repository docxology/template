**Overview/Summary**

The paper describes a photonic integrated circuit (PIC) called Ascella, which is capable of versatile single-photon processing and can be used for various quantum computing applications. The authors first present the design of Ascella, including its structure and characterization. Then, they demonstrate the use of Ascella in two applications: boson sampling and a photonic-based variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. In the VQE application, they apply the VQE to the H2 molecule, which is one of the most well-studied molecules in quantum chemistry. The results show that the experimental data are consistent with the simulation based on the estimated parameters from the machine learning-based characterization process.

The main contributions and findings of this paper are as follows:
1. **Design of Ascella**: This paper presents a photonic integrated circuit (PIC) called Ascella, which is capable of versatile single-photon processing and can be used for various quantum computing applications. The authors first present the design of Ascella, including its structure and characterization.
2. **Boson sampling**: Two statistical tests are used to discriminate the experimental data against the uniform sampler and distinguishable particle hypotheses. The A&O counter and the likelihood ratio counter, respectively, are increased or decreased according to a likelihood ratio test. The A&O counter A is defined as57,58
Ak ∶= (1) Ak−1 if 𝒫𝒫 (n,m) 2; (2) Ak−1 − 1 if 𝒫𝒫 (n,m) 2.
3. **Likelihood ratio counter**: C is defined as57,59
Ck = (1) Ck−1 if ℒ (n,m) 2; (2) Ck−1 − 1 if ℒ (n,m).
4. **Heralded three-photons GHZ on-chip generation**: The authors generate a path-encoded three-photon GHZ state, which is characterized with three reconfigurable integrated Mach–Zehnder interferometers (MZIi, i = 1, 2, 3). The layout of the optical circuit is provided in the Supplementary Section 9. Measuring six photons with threshold detectors, the output state of the circuit

**Limitations/Discussion**

The main limitations and future work of this paper are as follows:
1. **Characterization**: The authors use a machine learning-aided approach to characterize the Ascella chip, which is different from more standard characterization techniques involving interference-fringe measurements. This process offers a seven-fold improvement on the transpilation (⃗ϕ to ⃗V) over more standard characterization techniques.
2. **Variational quantum eigensolver**: The authors use 32 of the reconfigurable thermo-opic phase shifters as the variational parameters, and 4 phase shifters in the middle of the chip for the data encoding. They use extra modes for pseudo photon-number resolution: by setting four phase shifters to π/2 in the final layer of the chip, they redirect a portion of the photons from modes 3 and 7 into modes 1, 2 and 9 respectively.
3. **Classical optimization process**: The authors use a see-saw approach based on Gaussian processes and Nelder–Mead optimizers for the classical optimization process. More details regarding the circuit ansatz, model definition, pseudo photon-number resolution and the optimization methods are in Supplementary Section 7.
