**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Phases of active matter in two dimensions" by G. Biroli et al., published in 2019, reviews the current understanding of the phases and phase transitions that can occur in a system with two spatial dimensions when the particles are driven out of equilibrium. The authors focus on the case where the driving is through an external field that is constant in time but random in space, as well as the case where the driving is self-

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main findings of the paper are the following:

1. The authors summarize the current status of our understanding of the phases that can occur when the external driving is through an external field, as well as the case where the driving is self-

2. The authors discuss the KTHNY theory for the melting of a two-dimensional solid. The KTHNY theory is based on the continuous elastic model of a solid separated into the contribution of the smooth displacements and the one of the defects. The authors point out that the HNY scenario, which was proposed by Halperin and Nelson in 1979, is not supported by the current numerical data. In this case, the transition from solid to hexatic is of second order, and the transition from hexatic to liquid is also of second order.

3. The authors suggest that the transition from the solid to the hexatic phase may be of first order. This scenario is similar to the one proposed by Domany, Schick and Swendsen in 1984 with a numerical study, and later shown rigorously by van Enter and Shlosman in 2002.
