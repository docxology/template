**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Demonstrating the Continual Learning Capabilities and Practical Application of Discrete-Time Active Inference" by Zhang et al. (2023) presents a novel application of the free energy principle, which is a theoretical framework that has been widely used in various fields such as neuroscience, cognitive science, computer vision, and robotics. The authors first review the recent advances in active inference, including its theoretical foundations and practical applications. Then, they propose to apply this framework to demonstrate the continual learning capabilities of an agent that can learn from any data distribution without forgetting previously learned knowledge. They also provide a simple yet powerful discrete-time version of the variational bound (VB) for Markov decision processes (MDPs), which is a mathematical tool used in active inference and reinforcement learning. In this paper, they demonstrate the continual learning capabilities of an agent that can learn from any data distribution without forgetting previously learned knowledge. The authors also provide a simple yet powerful discrete-time version of the variational bound (VB) for Markov decision processes (MDPs), which is a mathematical tool used in active inference and reinforcement learning.

**Results/Data**

The main results of this paper are threefold. First, it reviews the recent advances in active inference, including its theoretical foundations and practical applications.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The main limitations of this paper are threefold. First, the authors do not discuss the potential applications of the proposed approach to other fields such as finance and healthcare. Second, the authors do not mention the future work on more sophisticated generative models and processes that would allow agents not only to learn new mappings but also to discover new state factors and observation modalities. Third, the authors do not integrate Active Inference with other AI paradigms, such as large language models or reinforcement learning, which could yield even more adaptable and capable agents.
