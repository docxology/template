Title: A deep variational free energy approach to dense hydrogen
Authors: T. Miyake, K. Nakamura, and Y. Yamaguchi
Journal: arXiv preprint (2021)
Abstract: We propose a novel method for the first-principles calculation of the equation of state of dense hydrogen based on a deep learning approach. The free energy is represented as a two-fold expectation over the proton and electron coordinates. In this paper, we present an application to the high-density region where the density is more than 1.5 g/cm3. The calculated results are compared with the experimental data and the other theoretical calculations.
