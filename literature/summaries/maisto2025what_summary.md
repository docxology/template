**Overview/Summary**
The paper proposes a novel approach to detect Markov blankets in complex networks by using Fiedler vector analysis. The authors first introduce the concept of Markov blanket and its importance for community detection. Then they propose an algorithm based on Fiedler vector, which is different from existing methods that use spectral clustering or modularity maximization. The proposed method can be used to detect the boundary nodes in a graph and then identify the communities.
