**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Deep Active Inference for Autonomous Robot Navigation" presents a novel approach to active inference in autonomous robot navigation. The authors propose a deep learning-based framework that leverages the concept of active inference and applies it to the problem of robotic navigation, which is a complex task that requires the robot to make decisions based on its own observations about the environment. In this paper, they present an end-to-end trainable architecture for the first time, which can be trained from scratch without any human demonstration or prior knowledge. The proposed framework consists of two main components: the likelihood model and the prior model. The likelihood model is a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) that predicts the probability distribution over all possible next actions given the current state of the robot and the environment, while the prior model is also a CNN that learns to predict the probability distribution over all possible next states given the current action. In this paper, they use the concept of active inference for the first time in the context of autonomous robots.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this work are as follows:
- The authors propose an end-to-end trainable architecture that can be trained from scratch without any human demonstration or prior knowledge.
- They present a new deep learning-based framework to solve the problem of active inference for the first time in the context of autonomous robots. This is the first time that the concept of active inference has been applied to the problem of robotic navigation.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use the concept of active inference, which is a process theory that can be used to describe both perception and action. The likelihood model is a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) that predicts the probability distribution over all possible next actions given the current state of the robot and the environment, while the prior model is also a CNN that learns to predict the probability distribution over all possible next states given the current action. In this paper, they use the concept of active inference for the first time in the context of autonomous robots.
