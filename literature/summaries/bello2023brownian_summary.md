**Overview/Summary**

The paper presents a study of the dynamics of a Brownian particle in a one-dimensional potential with an external driving force and a Poisson- shot noise. The authors investigate the effects of the non-Gaussian nature of the noise on the stationary probability density function (PDF) and the time evolution of the system. The main results are as follows.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main finding is that the stationary PDF of the Brownian particle in a one-dimensional potential with an external driving force and a Poisson-shot noise is non-Gaussian, even if the initial condition is Gaussian. This result is different from the case where the driving force is absent. The authors also find that the time evolution of the system is not ergodic. In other words, the long-time average of the particle's position does not equal to its stationary PDF.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use numerical simulations and analytical calculations to study the dynamics of a Brownian particle in a one-dimensional potential with an external driving force and a Poisson-shot noise. The time evolution of the system is obtained by solving the Langevin equation numerically. The stationary PDF is calculated from the long-time average of the position data. The authors also use the analytical method to calculate the stationary PDF.

**Results/Data**

The main results are as follows. First, the stationary PDF with a non-Gaussian driving force and a Poisson-shot noise is different from the case where the driving force is absent. Second, the time evolution of the system is not ergodic. In other words, the long-time average of the particle's position does not equal to its stationary PDF.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors point out that the non-Gaussian nature of the noise and the external driving force can cause the non-ergodicity of the time evolution of the system. The authors also mention some future work, such as the case where the anharmonic potential is considered in the presence of fluctuating forces different from white Gaussian noise.
