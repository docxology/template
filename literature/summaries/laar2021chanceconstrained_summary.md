**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Chance-Constraint Active Inference" by [Authors] is a seminal work in the field of active inference and control. The authors provide a unified view of the two subfields that are often considered to be distinct, and demonstrate how they can be formulated as one and the same problem: minimizing the free energy. They also show that this formulation provides a more general framework for solving problems in both fields than what has been previously available. The paper is organized into six sections. In the first section, the authors provide an overview of the two subfields. The second section describes how active inference and control as inference can be formulated as one problem: minimizing the free energy. The third section discusses the key contributions of this work. The fourth section describes the methodology/approach used in the paper. The fifth section presents the results/data, which are the main findings of the paper. The sixth section is a discussion/limitation section that explains the weaknesses and future work.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors show how active inference and control as inference can be formulated as one problem: minimizing the free energy. This provides a more general framework for solving problems in both fields than what has been previously available. The authors also show that this formulation provides a more general framework for solving problems in both fields than what has been previously available.

**Methodology/Approach**

The paper is based on the Bethe approximation, which is an approximate method to solve the free energy minimization problem. The authors use the Bethe approximation as the methodology/approach of their work. They also show that this formulation provides a more general framework for solving problems in both fields than what has been previously available.

**Results/Data**

The main findings of the paper are the results and data presented in the fourth section, which is the results/data section. The authors present the results and data as the main findings of their work. The results and data are the main contributions of this work. The results and data are the key findings of the paper.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The fifth section is a discussion/limitation section that explains the weaknesses and future work. The authors explain the limitations of the current formulation in the fifth section. They also provide some suggestions for future work. The authors also mention the related works at the end of this section. The authors show how their work relates to other research in the field, which is a key contribution of this paper.
