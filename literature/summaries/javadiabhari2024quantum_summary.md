**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Quantum computing with Qiskit" presents a high-level overview of the capabilities and features of Qiskit, an open-source software framework for quantum development, application, and deployment. The authors' goal is to provide a comprehensive platform for building, testing, and deploying quantum applications in a variety of domains, including chemistry, materials science, optimization, machine learning, and more. They describe the key components that make up the Qiskit ecosystem, which includes the Qiskit compiler, the Qiskit simulator, and the Qiskit SDK. The paper also provides an overview of the Qiskit development process, which is open-source, community-driven, and transparent.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The key findings are that the authors have developed a comprehensive platform for building, testing, and deploying quantum applications in a variety of domains. This platform includes the Qiskit compiler, the Qiskit simulator, and the Qiskit SDK. The paper also provides an overview of the Qiskit development process, which is open-source, community-driven, and transparent.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors describe the key components that make up the Qiskit ecosystem, which includes the Qiskit compiler, the Qiskit simulator, and the Qiskit SDK. The paper also provides an overview of the Qiskit development process, which is open-source, community-driven, and transparent.

**Results/Data**

The authors do not present any new results in this paper as it is a high-level overview paper. They only describe the capabilities and features of the Qiskit compiler, the Qiskit simulator, and the Qiskit SDK. The execution via the estimator and analysis of results are exactly as before. The results are shown in Figure 4(3) (right). We can see a large savings in circuit depth compared to the mapping and routing approach.
