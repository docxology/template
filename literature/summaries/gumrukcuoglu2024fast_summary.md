**Overview/Summary**

The paper presents a novel method for inferring solid-state diffusion coefficients (D) in Li-ion batteries from galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) data. The authors claim that the new method is faster and more accurate than existing methods, which are based on the Sand equation. The proposed method, called ICM, is a non-linear optimisation problem that can be solved to obtain D as well as other model parameters such as the surface area of the particles (A) and the initial concentration (c0). The authors also discuss how the new method may be used in the field to update the model parameters from incoming data as the device ages, a process that is likely to be useful for predicting future device performance. The paper does not mention any potential applications beyond the field of Li-ion batteries.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The key contributions are the development and demonstration of the ICM method. This involves the application of a non-linear optimisation problem to obtain D as well as other model parameters, such as the surface area (A) and the initial concentration (c0). The authors also discuss how the new method may be used in the field to update the model parameters from incoming data as the device ages, which is likely to be useful for predicting future device performance. The paper does not mention any potential applications beyond the field of Li-ion batteries.

**Results/Data**

The results section is where you would describe what was found or measured. This should include specific details, numbers, and findings from the paper. It may also include some discussion of the limitations of the data, but this should be in the context of the broader discussion rather than a separate section. The authors do not mention any potential applications beyond the field of Li-ion batteries.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The paper does not discuss any potential applications beyond the field of Li-ion batteries. The authors also suggest that the ICM method may be used to update the model parameters from incoming data as the device ages, which is likely to be useful for predicting future device performance. This is a discussion point rather than a separate section.
