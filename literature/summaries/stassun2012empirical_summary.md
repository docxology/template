**Overview/Summary**

The paper by Schmidt et al. (2012) is a follow-up to their 2010 study of activity effects on the temperature and luminosity of M-dwarf stars. The authors use an empirical correction for the activity effect in order to compare the measured properties of active and inactive M-dwarfs with the theoretical evolutionary tracks. They apply this correction to the primary and secondary components of the brown dwarf eclipsing binary 2M0535-05, which is a ∼1 Myr old member of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). The authors use the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HRD) as a diagnostic tool for the comparison. The HRD is a plot that shows the effective temperature and luminosity of a star on the same graph. The primary and secondary components are both M8-dwarfs, but they have different levels of activity. The authors use the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram to compare the measured properties with the theoretical evolutionary tracks. The authors find that the primary is 2-3 times more active than the secondary. The authors also find that the measured temperature and luminosity for the two components are not consistent with their expected positions on the HRD. This is because the primary has a much higher level of activity than the secondary, so it is much cooler than expected. If the correction for the activity effect is applied to the primary's position in the HRD, then the primary and the secondary will be very close to each other. The authors find that the primary is 27 MJup, which is only a factor of two lower than its true mass.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main finding of this paper is the empirical correction for the activity effect on the temperature and luminosity of M-dwarf stars. This correction can be used to compare the measured properties with the theoretical evolutionary tracks. The authors find that the primary has a much higher level of activity than the secondary, so it is cooler than expected. If the correction for the activity effect is applied to the primary's position in the HRD, then the primary and the secondary will be very close to each other.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram as a diagnostic tool for the comparison of the measured properties with the theoretical evolutionary tracks. The authors find that the primary has a much higher level of activity than the secondary, so it is cooler than expected. If the correction for the activity effect is applied to the primary's position in the HRD, then the primary and the secondary will be very close to each other.

**Results/Data**

The measured temperature and luminosity for the two components are not consistent with their expected positions on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. The authors find that the primary has a much higher level of activity than the secondary, so it is cooler than expected. If the correction for the activity effect is applied to the primary's position in the HRD, then the primary and the secondary will be very close to each other.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The main weakness of this paper is that the authors only use one star as a test case. The authors should have used more stars. This would make their results more generalizable. The authors also do not discuss the possibility of systematic errors in the data. If there are systematic errors in the data, then the authors' correction may be incorrect.
