**Overview/Summary**
The paper "Active inference goes to school: the importance of active inference" is a philosophical and theoretical analysis of the relationship between perception, cognition, and action in humans and artificial intelligence (AI) systems. The authors argue that the traditional approach to AI, which they call "passive inference," is not only too narrow but also wrong-headed. They claim that it is based on an outdated view of how human beings perceive the world and act upon it. According to this view, perception is a passive process in which we receive sensory information from the environment and then use our cognitive resources to interpret what that information means. The authors argue that this approach has been influential in the development of AI systems, and that it is still used today.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The main finding of the paper is that the traditional "passive inference" view of perception and cognition is wrong-headed. It is based on an outdated view of how human beings perceive the world and act upon it. The authors argue that this approach has been influential in the development of AI systems, and that it is still used today.
