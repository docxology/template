**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Estimating quantities conserved by virtue of scale in scale-free networks" by Fagerholm et al (2019) is a theoretical investigation into the properties of dynamic causal models (DCMs) that are invariant to scale. The authors show that, for a particular class of DCMs, the number of free parameters is independent of the size of the system and hence the number of variables. They also provide an empirical test of this property using fMRI data.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of the paper are two-fold. First, it provides a theoretical proof that the number of free parameters in DCMs is independent of the size of the system. Second, it shows that the number of free parameters in DCMs is independent of the size of the system for the fMRI data. The first contribution is based on an empirical Bayes (EB) approach to DCMs, which provides a way of comparing models with different numbers of free parameters. The second contribution is based on the same EB approach.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors begin by providing some background and context for their work. They explain that the number of free parameters in a DCM depends on its size and that this property has been used to motivate the use of smaller models, which are easier to estimate and interpret. The authors then describe the EB approach to DCMs, which is based on the idea that the true model is not known but that it is possible to compare different models using their free parameters. They also explain the importance of the "free" parameter in this context, as well as how they define a "free" parameter and what they mean by "independent of the size of the system". The authors then describe the theoretical approach used to prove the main result. This is based on an EB approach to DCMs, which is described in detail. They also explain that this theoretical approach can be applied to fMRI data.

**Results/Data**

The first part of the paper describes the theoretical results. It begins by explaining what they mean by "independent of the size of the system" and then describes the main result. The authors show that, for a particular class of DCMs, the number of free parameters is independent of the size of the system. They also explain how this property can be used to motivate the use of smaller models. The second part of the paper describes the empirical results. It begins by explaining what they mean by "independent of the size of the system" and then explains the main result. This is based on an EB approach to DCMs, which is described in detail. They also explain that this theoretical approach can be applied to fMRI data.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors discuss the limitations of their work. The first part of the discussion describes the theoretical results. It begins by explaining what they mean by "independent of the size of the system" and then explains the main result. They also explain how this property can be used to motivate the use of smaller models. The second part of the discussion is based on the same EB approach. The authors discuss some future work.
