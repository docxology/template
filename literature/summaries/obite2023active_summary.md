**Overview/Summary**
The paper proposes an active inference approach to maximize the sum rate in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). The authors consider a scenario where the UAVs are equipped with limited power and communicate with the ground base station (BS) through two-hop relay nodes. In this system, the BS is connected to a set of relays which in turn are connected to the UAVs. The authors' approach is based on the concept that the optimal policy for maximizing the sum rate in NOMA systems is not necessarily to maximize the weighted sum rate. This is because the weights for different users may be different and it is difficult to determine the optimal weights. In this paper, the authors first formulate a new optimization problem called the sum-rate maximization (SRM) problem which is different from the traditional weighted sum rate maximization (WSRM) problem. The WSRM problem is to maximize the weighted sum of the logarithmic mutual information between the BS and each user while the SRM problem is to maximize the sum of the logarithmic mutual information between the BS and all users. The authors show that the optimal policy for maximizing the sum rate in NOMA systems is not necessarily to maximize the WSRM. This is because the weights for different users may be different and it is difficult to determine the optimal weights.
