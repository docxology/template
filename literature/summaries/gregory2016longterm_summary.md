**Overview/Summary**

The long-term evolution of stellar activity is a fundamental problem in astrophysics and has been studied for decades. The main question is how the level of magnetic activity changes with time on a star's lifetime. This paper presents an overview of the current state of our knowledge about the long-term evolution of stellar activity, which is based on the results from the last 20 years' observations and theoretical studies.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contribution of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of the present status of the field. The authors discuss the main issues in the field of the long-term evolution of stellar activity, including the current understanding of the long-term evolution of magnetic activity on stars with different masses and the comparison between the observations and models. They also give some suggestions for future work.
