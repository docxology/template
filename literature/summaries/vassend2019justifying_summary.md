**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Justifying the Norms of Inductive Inference" by Vassend (2019) presents a framework for justifying the norms of inductive inference that is based on the idea of minimizing inaccuracy. The author argues that the traditional Bayesian approach to this problem, which is based on the idea of maximizing expected accuracy, is not well-motivated and instead proposes an alternative that is based on the idea of minimizing inaccuracy. This new framework is motivated by a number of considerations. First, it is argued that the traditional Bayesian approach does not provide a clear motivation for why the norms of inductive inference should be what they are. Second, the author argues that the traditional Bayesian approach has difficulties in dealing with cases where the true distribution is unknown or when the data is incomplete. The paper also presents some criticisms of the traditional Bayesian approach to this problem and its application in phylogenetics.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contribution of the paper is a characterization of the combination function that is used in the new framework, which is based on the idea of minimizing inaccuracy. The author provides a number of characterizations of the combination function. First, it is shown that if the combination function is continuous and satisfies the condition (A.1), then it must be of the form c(x) = x + b for some constant b. Second, the characterization can also be extended to cases where the combination function is not necessarily continuous. Third, the author shows that the characterization can also be applied in a case where the combination function is not necessarily symmetric.

**Methodology/Approach**

The paper begins by presenting the traditional Bayesian approach to this problem and its application in phylogenetics. The traditional approach is based on the idea of maximizing expected accuracy. It is argued that the traditional approach does not provide a clear motivation for why the norms of inductive inference should be what they are. This is followed by some criticisms of the traditional approach. Finally, the author presents the new framework and its application to phylogenetics.

**Results/Data**

The paper does not present any data or results. Rather, it provides an argument for why a particular set of norms should be used in inductive inference. The argument is based on the idea that the traditional Bayesian approach is not well-motivated and instead proposes an alternative that is based on the idea of minimizing inaccuracy.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The paper does not present any limitations or discussion section. It only presents some criticisms of the traditional Bayesian approach to this problem. The author also discusses some difficulties with the application of the traditional Bayesian approach to phylogenetics, and how these problems are avoided by the new framework.
