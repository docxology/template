**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Bayesian inference of wall torques for active Brownian particles" by [Author Names] is a comprehensive study that introduces a Bayesian framework to infer the empirical torque model from experimental data. The authors investigate the accuracy and robustness of the classical approach in fitting the empirical torque model, which has been widely used in the literature to describe the motion of anisotropic colloids, such as active Brownian particles (ABPs), and propose a new Bayesian inference method to learn the wall torques from observational data. The authors test their proposed method on synthetic data 

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this paper are threefold. First, the authors show that the accuracy of the classical approach in fitting the empirical torque model is not as good as previously thought when the system dynamics can be described by a single Euler- Maruyama step between observation times. The Bayesian inference method presented here works robustly in the test cases where the predefined torque functions are used to generate the synthetic data, and it directly highlights where information about the system is gained and where the model stays elusive. Second, the authors find that the empirical torque model is effective for ABPs inbound to a wall, whereas the outbound direction is not affected by the choice of the torque model. Third, the Bayesian inference method described here is general and also applicable to inferring other properties of active particles.

**Methodology/Approach**

The paper starts with an introduction to the empirical torque model that has been widely used in the literature to describe the motion of anisotropic colloids such as ABPs. The authors then introduce a Bayesian inference framework to learn the torque model from observational data. This method is based on the assumption that the system dynamics can be described by a single Euler-Maruyama step between observation times, which is exact for their synthetic data but will be an approximation when the method is applied to gather information from real experiments. The authors test their proposed method on synthetic data 

**Results/Data**

The authors first show that the accuracy of the classical approach in fitting the empirical torque model is not as good as previously thought when the system dynamics can be described by a single Euler-Maruyama step between observation times. The Bayesian inference method presented here works robustly in the test cases where the predefined torque functions are used to generate the synthetic data, and it directly highlights where information about the system is gained and where the model stays elusive. The authors then apply their proposed method to real data obtained from rod simulations that resemble experimental data.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The Bayesian inference method described here relies on the assumption that the system dynamics can be described by a single Euler-Maruyama step between observation times. While this is exact for their synthetic data, it will be an approximation when the method is applied to gather information from real experiments, and its accuracy remains to be explored. Finally, the authors want to emphasize that the Bayesian approach described here to infer wall torques is general and also applicable to inferring other properties of active particles.
