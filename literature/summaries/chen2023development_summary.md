Overview/Summary:
The paper presents a novel online home energy management (HEM) strategy for the coordination of loads in a smart home. The proposed HEM strategy is able to minimize both grid electricity cost and user discomfort by operation of deferrals. The evaluation of the HEM performance is conducted based on the definition of systematic performance metrics, over multiple simulations with one year duration and dient household characteristics.

Key Contributions/Findings:
The HEM strategy saves on average $160 of the electricity cost to the user per year compared to the baseline case. The deferrable appliance are rescheduled by HEM controller to simultaneously beneﬁt from low grid prices, renewable generation and stationary energy storage. Moreover, simulations show that the optimal strategy consists in charging the energy storage using the renewable sources, rather than directly using them to meet the household power demand. Additionally, simulations show that the HEM strategy is able to utilize the solar power more eﬃciently by leveraging the energy storage system to lower the grid cost. Even if the deferral eﬃciency is the lowest in San Antonio, the utilization of the solar power to increase the energy storage SOC is the most signiﬁcant in this location. Hence, it is the non-deferrable power, typically HVAC, that drives the split between storing the locally generated power or utilizing it to meet the instantaneous demand. Additionally, simulations show that the HEM strategy provides better temperature comfort at a lower cost compared to the traditional dead-band controller. In all cases it is found that the energy storage is utilized more frequently by the HEM strategy, compared to the baseline strategy. However, the battery size for either the electric vehicle or the energy storage has a limited eﬀect of the performance of the HEM strategy. Conversely, the size and location of the household is a main factor when evaluating the controller performance.

Methodology/Approach:
The proposed HEM strategy is developed based on an optimization-based approach that considers both the user comfort and the grid cost. The evaluation of the HEM performance is conducted over multiple simulations with one year duration and dient household characteristics. The simulation results are compared to a baseline case, which is a dead-band controller. The baseline case does not consider the deferrals in scheduling the loads. The baseline strategy saves on average $0.00 of the electricity cost per year compared to the HEM strategy.

Results/Data:
The total deferrable power is 24.77 MWh for Columbus, 24.97 MWh for Los Angeles, 25.85 MWh for San Antonio and 29.64 MWh for Boston. The deferred power is 12.11 MWh for Columbus, 12.47 MWh for Los Angeles, 10.96 MWh for San Antonio and 13.78 MWh for Boston. The deferral eﬃciency surpasses 42% for every presented case, validating that the HEM strategy is eﬀective. The power distribution within the four house locations is summarized in Table 10. The total non-deferrable power is 10.78 MWh for Columbus, 9.76 MWh for Los Angeles, 12.32 MWh for San Antonio and 11.94 MWh for Boston. The total deferrable power is 24.77 MWh for Columbus, 24.97 MWh for Los Angeles, 25.85 MWh for San Antonio and 29.64 MWh for Boston. The total power is 35.55 MWh for Columbus, 34.73 MWh for Los Angeles, 38.17 MWh for San Antonio and 41.58 MWh for Boston.

Limitations/Discussion:
The size of the household is a main factor when evaluating the controller performance. This is due to the relationship between home size and location. The HEM strategy saves on average $160 of the electricity cost to the user per year compared to the baseline case. The deferrable appliance are rescheduled by HEM controller to simultaneously beneﬁt from low grid prices, renewable generation and stationary energy storage. Moreover, simulations show that the optimal strategy consists in charging the energy storage using the renewable sources, rather than directly using them to meet the household power demand. Additionally, simulations show that the HEM strategy is able to utilize the solar power more eﬃciently by leveraging the energy storage system to lower the grid cost. Even if the deferral eﬃciency is the lowest in San Antonio, the utilization of the solar power to increase the energy storage SOC is the most signiﬁcant in this location.
