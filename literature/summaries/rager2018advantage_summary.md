**Overview/Summary**

The starving random walk model of foraging is a well-known framework in ecology and evolutionary biology for understanding how animals search for food resources. The model has been used to study the optimal foraging strategy when the animal can eat all it finds, which is known as the normal or perfect forager (NF). In this paper, the authors extend the NF model by allowing the forager to be myopic and eat with probability p < 1 when it encounters food. This myopic forager eats when it is nutritionally depleted by a significant amount, so that the wastage of food resources is small. The myopic forager lives much longer than the normal forager (NF) because the NF always eats again soon after its most recent meal. In this paper, the authors study the optimal degree of myopia p* and the maximal lifetime T*. The main results are that the optimal myopia p* appears to scale as ln S/ in one dimension and as S-α in two dimensions with α ≈ 0.8. At this optimal myopia, the maximal lifetime T* appears to grow as S2/ln in one dimension and as exp( Sβ) in two dimensions with β close to the value 1 - α, as anticipated from a general formula.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main findings of the paper are that the forager lifetime is maximized when the basic model parameter, the degree of myopia p, is set to an optimal value. This optimal myopia p* appears to scale as ln S/ in one dimension and as S-α in two dimensions with α ≈ 0.8. At this optimal myopia, the maximal lifetime T* appears to grow as S2/ln in one dimension and as exp( Sβ) in two dimensions, with β close to the value 1 - α, as anticipated from a general formula.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use the starving random walk model of foraging. The myopic forager eats when it is nutritionally depleted by a significant amount, so that the wastage of food resources is small. The myopic forager lives much longer than the normal forager (NF) because the NF always eats again soon after its most recent meal. In this paper, the authors study the optimal degree of myopia p* and the maximal lifetime T*. The main results are that the optimal myopia p* appears to scale as ln S/ in one dimension and as S-α in two dimensions with α ≈ 0.8. At this optimal myopia, the maximal lifetime T* appears to grow as S2/ln in one dimension and as exp( Sβ) in two dimensions, with β close to the value 1 - α, as anticipated from a general formula.

**Results/Data**

The authors study the behavior of the forager lifetime versus p. The only claim that can be made from the small range of data is that T* grows faster than any power law in S. This increased lifetime arises because the myopic forager typically eats when it is nutritionally depleted by a signiﬁcant amount, so that the wastage of food resources is small. In contrast, the NF always eats again soon after its most recent meal and thus may waste a considerable amount of food whenever it eats again soon. Thus for a naive forager with limited information processing capability, being myopic—equivalently, being somewhat clueless—turns out to be a surprisingly eﬀective survival strategy.

**Limitations/Discussion**

An important message from this model is that a forager with a poor ability to detect food lives much longer than a forager with perfect detection capability. This increased lifetime arises because the myopic forager typically eats when it is nutritionally depleted by a signiﬁcant amount, so that the wastage of food resources is small. In contrast, the NF always eats again soon after its most recent meal and thus may waste a considerable amount of food whenever it eats again soon. Thus for a naive forager with limited information processing capability, being myopic—equivalently, being somewhat clueless—turns out to be a surprisingly eﬀective survival strategy.
