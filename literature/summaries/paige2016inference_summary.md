**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Inference Networks for Sequential Monte Carlo in Graphical Models" by Paige et al. (2015) introduces a new class of models called Inference Networks and uses them to perform inference in graphical models, such as Bayesian networks and Markov random fields. This is an important contribution to the field of probabilistic programming, which has seen recent advances with the development of tools like Pyrope and Church. The paper also shows how to apply this new class of models to a number of problems that are difficult or impossible for existing approaches.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of the paper are: 1) Inference Networks, which are a new kind of probabilistic program that can be used for inference in graphical models; and 2) how to apply these networks to sequential Monte Carlo methods. The authors show that their approach is able to perform well on a number of problems that are difficult or impossible for existing approaches.
