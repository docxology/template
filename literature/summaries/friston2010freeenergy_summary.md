**Overview/Summary**

The free-energy principle is a unified brain theory proposed by Karl Friston in 2010. This supplementary information provides mathematical derivations and explanations for the entropy of sensory states and their causes. The paper explores the relationship between the entropy of hidden environmental states and the entropy of sensory signals.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main finding is that the entropy of hidden environmental states is upper-bounded by the entropy of sensory states, assuming a constant sensitivity to hidden states over the range of states encountered. This result is derived from the stochastic differential equations of motion and the mutual information between sensory states and noise.

**Methodology/Approach**

The approach involves using ergodic assumptions and stochastic differential equations to model the relationship between hidden environmental states and sensory signals. The paper assumes that sensory states are an analytic function of hidden environmental states plus generalized random fluctuations. The sensitivity or gradient of the sensory mapping with respect to hidden states is also considered.

**Results/Data**

The results show that the entropy of hidden environmental states is upper-bounded by the entropy of sensory states, as expressed in equations S1.3 and S1.4. This finding has implications for understanding the relationship between the brain's internal state and its sensory inputs.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The paper notes that the ergodic assumption only holds over certain temporal scales for real organisms, which can be somatic (e.g., days or months) or evolutionary (e.g., generations). This limitation highlights the need for further research to explore the applicability of the free-energy principle across different timescales and contexts.

**Conclusion**

The supplementary information provides a mathematical framework for understanding the relationship between the entropy of hidden environmental states and the entropy of sensory signals. The findings have implications for developing a unified brain theory, which can be applied to various fields, including neuroscience, psychology, and artificial intelligence.
