**Overview/Summary**

The free-energy principle (FEP) is a unified theory of brain function that posits that the brain minimizes its own free energy in order to explain the world. The FEP has been developed over the past decade, and this paper provides an overview of the current state of the field. The FEP is based on the idea that the brain is a generative model of the environment, which means it must be able to predict the sensory consequences of its own internal states. This prediction error is the driving force for learning. The FEP also assumes that the brain has two main components: the generative and the recognition systems. The generative system generates predictions about the world based on past experiences. The recognition system is responsible for comparing these predictions to the actual sensory data, which results in a measure of surprise. This paper provides an overview of the theory and its current status.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The FEP was first introduced by Karl Friston in 2005 (Friston, 2005). The core idea is that the brain minimizes the free energy, which is the negative log-likelihood of the sensory data. This paper provides a detailed explanation and justification for this theory. The main contribution of this paper is to show that the FEP can be used to explain many aspects of brain function, including perception, action, learning, and decision-making.

**Methodology/Approach**

The approach taken in this paper is based on the idea that the brain is a generative model of the environment. The FEP uses the concept of free energy, which is the negative log-likelihood of the sensory data. This means the brain can be seen as an inference machine. The main idea is to use Bayes' theorem to update the internal state (or hidden states) based on the sensory data. The generative and recognition systems are two components of this process. The generative system generates predictions about the world, which are compared with the actual sensory data. The difference between these two is the prediction error. This error drives learning. The FEP also assumes that the brain has to be able to explain the sensory data in order for it to learn from them. This means the brain must have a generative model of itself (i.e., its own internal states). The paper provides an overview of the current state of the field and how the FEP can be used to explain many aspects of brain function.

**Results/Data**

The main result is that the FEP can be used to explain many different aspects of brain function. This includes perception, action, learning, and decision-making. The FEP also provides a unified explanation for the neural basis of consciousness. It has been shown that the FEP can be applied to many different areas of research in neuroscience.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The main limitation is that the paper does not provide an overall framework or a comprehensive theory. The FEP is based on the idea that the brain is a generative model, which means it must have a generative and recognition system. This is a very general concept. It needs to be further developed in order for it to be used as a comprehensive theory of brain function.
