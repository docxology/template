**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Wireless Communication Aided by Intelligent Reflecting Surface: How to Deploy?" is an extension of a previous work [1] that introduced the concept of intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) and its applications in wireless communications. The authors consider the problem of how to deploy IRSs in wireless networks, including BS-side, user-side, or both sides, which is a crucial step towards the practical implementation of 6G. In this paper, the authors first present an overview of the state-of-the-art research on the deployment of IRSs. Then they discuss the pros and cons of deploying IRSs at different locations in wireless networks. The authors also compare the performance of active RIS with that of passive RIS under respectively optimized IRS placement. Finally, the authors summarize their findings and future work.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this paper are the discussions on the pros and cons of deploying IRSs at different locations in wireless networks and the comparison between the performance of active RIS and that of passive RIS. The authors also present a summary of the state-of-the-art research on the deployment of IRSs.

**Methodology/Approach**

The methodology/approach used by this paper is to discuss the pros and cons of deploying IRSs at different locations in wireless networks, which is based on the previous work [1]. In this paper, the authors also compare the performance of active RIS with that of passive RIS under respectively optimized IRS placement. The authors use a similar approach as the previous work [1] to discuss the deployment of IRSs.

**Results/Data**

The results/data in this paper are the discussions on the pros and cons of deploying IRSs at different locations in wireless networks, which is based on the previous work [1]. The performance comparison between active RIS and passive RIS under respectively optimized IRS placement is also presented. The authors use a similar approach as the previous work [1] to discuss the deployment of IRSs.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The limitations/discussion in this paper are that the authors only provide an overview of the state-of-the-art research on the deployment of IRSs, and compare the performance of active RIS with that of passive RIS under respectively optimized IRS placement. The authors do not discuss the future work.
