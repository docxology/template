**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Changing Data Sources in the Age of Machine Learning for Official Statistics" by Wesley Yung and colleagues (2022) is a comprehensive review of the risks and consequences of changing data sources when using machine learning for official statistics, as well as potential mitigation strategies. The authors provide an extensive checklist of 14 different risks that can occur when using machine learning for official statistics. These include statistical issues and model inconsistencies to technical problems and ethical considerations. The paper also provides a few potential mitigation strategies. However, the authors admit that these strategies do not provide all the adequate answers and might leave the reader unsatisfied or, worse still, beguiled, as the solutions require many additional resources and efforts. As they have stressed a couple of times in this paper, this is a story of trade-offs. Depending on the use case at hand, some trade-offs may be easier to handle than others.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors identify 14 different risks that can occur when using machine learning for official statistics. These include statistical issues and model inconsistencies to technical problems and ethical considerations. The list is long and covers many different aspects, ranging from statistical issues and model inconsistencies to technical problems and ethical considerations. They also look at a few potential mitigation strategies. However, the authors admit that these strategies do not provide all the adequate answers and might leave the reader unsatisfied or, worse still, beguiled, as the solutions require many additional resources and efforts. As they have stressed a couple of times in this paper, this is a story of trade-offs. Depending on the use case at hand, some trade-offs may be easier to handle than others.
