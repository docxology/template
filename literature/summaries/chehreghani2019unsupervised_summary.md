**Overview/Summary**

The paper proposes a new unsupervised representation learning method based on minimax distance measures for graph-structured data. The authors argue that the existing methods are not well-suited to graph-structured data and do not take into account the underlying structure of the data, which is important in many real-world applications. They propose a novel approach that can learn representations from the graph-structured data without requiring any labeled training data or additional information about the data distribution. The proposed method is based on the minimax distance measures between pairs of nodes and does not require the data to be embedded into a vector space, which makes it more suitable for the graph-structured data.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors show that the existing methods are not well-suited to graph-structured data. The proposed method is based on the minimax distance measures between pairs of nodes and does not require the data to be embedded into a vector space, which makes it more suitable for the graph-structured data. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors first analyze the existing methods that are well-suited to the vector-structured data but not the graph-structured data. They then propose a novel approach based on the minimax distance measures between pairs of nodes. The proposed method is based on the minimax distance measures between pairs of nodes and does not require the data to be embedded into a vector space, which makes it more suitable for the graph-structured data. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.
