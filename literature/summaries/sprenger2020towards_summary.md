**Overview/Summary**
The study of active microswimmers in a viscous drop is an interdisciplinary field that has attracted much attention in recent years. In this paper, the authors investigate the motion of a self-propelled particle in a spherical drop with a clean or surfactant-covered interface. The authors first derive the equations of motion for the case where the interfacial viscosity is zero and then consider the general case where it is not. They find that the interfacial viscosity has an important effect on the swimming velocity, but the rotation rate is insensitive to the interfacial viscosity. This paper provides a comprehensive description of the analytical results in the literature.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The authors first derive the equations of motion for the case where the interfacial viscosity is zero and then consider the general case where it is not. They find that the interfacial viscosity has an important effect on the swimming velocity, but the rotation rate is insensitive to the interfacial viscosity.

**Methodology/Approach**
The authors first derive the equations of motion for the case where the interfacial viscosity is zero and then consider the general case where it is not. They find that the interfacial viscosity has an important effect on the swimming velocity, but the rotation rate is insensitive to the interfacial viscosity.

**Results/Data**
In a bulk Newtonian fluid of dynamic viscosity $\eta=10^{-3}$ Pa·s, E. coli bacteria swim with an average velocity $v_0\approx20$ $\mu$m/s. By approximating the flagella thrust forces as $f\approx0.5$ pN [207, 208] and the inter-dipole distance as $\ell\approx1$ $\mu$m [209], the resulting force dipolar coeﬃcient is estimated as $\alpha_{ph}=f\ell/(8\pi)$ Pa·s $=20$ $\mu$m$^3$/s. Rescaling the induced translational velocity by $v_0$ and the rotation rate by $v_0/a$, it follows from Eqs. (59) and (64) that
$$
{\rm v}_{ph}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\left({\rm V}_1+{\rm V}_2\cos(2\delta)\right)^2+{\rm V}_2\right)
,  \qquad {\rm w}=0,
$$
and
$$
{\rm v}_{ph}/a=\frac{1}{3}\left(
{\rm \Omega}_1+\Gamma\left({\rm \Omega}_2\cos(2\delta)+{\rm \Omega}_3\right)
\right),
$$
where $\Xi:=\alpha_{ph}/(a^2v_0)=10^{-4}$. The functions ${\rm V}_i$ and ${\rm \Omega}_i$, $i\in\{1,2,3\}$, are dimensionless quantities. In Fig. 8, the authors present the variation of the magnitude of the rescaled swimming velocities as stated by Eqs. (67) versus the parameter $\Lambda$ for various values of the surface to external bulk viscosity ratio $w$. Here, we consider a spherical viscous drop of radius $a=0.1$ mm. To limit the parameter space, they assume that the bacterium has an orientation angle $\delta=\pi/4$ and an aspect ratio $\sigma=2$ ($\Gamma=3/5$) [209]. The functions ${\rm V}_i$ and ${\rm \Omega}_i$, $i\in\{1,2,3\}$, are dimensionless quantities.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The presence of a surfactant has an important effect on the swimming velocity. Here, the authors consider the motion of a self-propelled particle in a spherical drop with a clean or surfactant-covered interface. The authors first derive the equations of motion for the case where the interfacial viscosity is zero and then consider the general case where it is not. They find that the interfacial viscosity has an important effect on the swimming velocity, but the rotation rate is insensitive to the interfacial viscosity.
