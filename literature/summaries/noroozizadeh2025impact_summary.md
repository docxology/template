**Overview/Summary**

The study examines the relationship between medication non-adherence and the timing of adverse events in patients with schizophrenia who are prescribed antipsychotics. The authors used a retrospective cohort design to compare the time-to-event for three types of adverse outcomes (mortality, hospitalization, and jail booking) among 3,145 patients with schizophrenia who were treated with oral or long-acting injectable (LAI) formulations of antipsychotics. They found that non-adherence was associated with a significantly earlier occurrence of the first adverse event in all three outcome categories.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The study found that the hazard ratio for the first hospitalization, jail booking, and death events were 1.44, 2.01, and 1.35 times higher when patients did not take their medication as prescribed compared to those who took it as directed. The authors also found that the time-to-event for each of these adverse outcomes was significantly earlier in the non-adherent group than in the adherent group.

**Methodology/Approach**

The study used a retrospective cohort design, which is an observational study that takes place after data collection has been completed. The authors analyzed administrative and pharmacy claims data from 2006 to 2015 for all patients with schizophrenia who were prescribed oral or LAI formulations of antipsychotics. They defined non-adherence as the proportion of days a patient did not take their medication as directed, which was calculated based on the number of days that a patient's prescription was not filled and the number of days that a patient had a partial fill (i.e., less than 30 days' worth). The authors also used propensity score matching to compare patients who were prescribed LAI formulations with those who were prescribed oral formulations. This is a statistical method for balancing the covariates between two groups, which are not randomly assigned.

**Results/Data**

The study found that non-adherence was associated with a significantly earlier occurrence of all three adverse outcomes. The hazard ratio for hospitalization, jail booking, and death events were 1.44, 2.01, and 1.35 times higher when patients did not take their medication as prescribed compared to those who took it as directed. The authors also found that the time-to-event for each of these adverse outcomes was significantly earlier in the non-adherent group than in the adherent group.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The study's findings suggest that improving adherence may be a useful strategy for reducing hospitalization rates and associated healthcare costs, but it is important to note that unmeasured factors correlated with adherence may drive this relationship. The authors also noted that the consistently negative ATE estimates do not guarantee that improving adherence will necessarily prevent adverse outcomes.

**Actionable Interventions**

The study's findings suggest that proactive, targeted interventions to enhance medication adherence could be beneficial. Examples of such initiatives include structured adherence counseling programs and advanced digital adherence technologies. These strategically targeted programs can leverage routinely collected administrative and pharmacy data to identify and proactively engage high-risk individuals, such as reaching out to them to check in on their well-being or possibly more directly incentivizing adherence by providing some sort of financial incentive such as a discount or rebate on specific medications.

**Other Future Research Directions**

The study's findings suggest that the relationship between non-adherence and adverse events is strong. Nonetheless, unmeasured factors correlated with adherence may drive this relationship, so these findings do not guarantee that improving adherence will necessarily prevent adverse outcomes. The authors also noted that the consistently negative ATE estimates indicate a strong link between non-adherence and earlier adverse events. Nonetheless, unmeasured factors correlated with adherence may drive this relationship, so these findings do not guarantee that improving adherence will necessarily prevent adverse outcomes.

**Policy Implications and Medication Type**

The study's findings underscore the effectiveness and efficiency of investing in comprehensive adherence-promoting programs rather than narrower, medication-specific interventions. Policy-makers and health administrators can utilize the quantified impact of adherence presented here to prioritize resource allocation towards robust, scalable, and broadly applicable adherence support initiatives. Examples of such initiatives include structured adherence counseling programs and advanced digital adherence technologies. These strategically targeted programs can leverage routinely collected administrative and pharmacy data to identify and proactively engage high-risk individuals, such as reaching out to them to check in on their well-being or possibly more directly incentivizing adherence by providing some sort of financial incentive such as a discount or rebate on specific medications.

**From a Clinical Standpoint**

The study's findings equip healthcare providers with precise, quantitative tools to clearly communicate the specific risks of medication non-adherence to patients. In our study, given the consistently observed delays in adverse events associated with adherence across different medication types and administration methods, clinicians can leverage this evidence to select medication formulations (injectable versus oral) tailored to individual patient preferences and adherence challenges. This direct and informed communication can significantly enhance patient awareness and engagement by providing concrete, personalized data that clearly illustrate the potential consequences of non-adherence and benefits of adherence-focused interventions. In practical terms, clinicians can use these results to better guide treatment discussions, set realistic patient expectations, and design individualized adherence support plans aimed explicitly at incentivizing and improving medication adherence, thus potentially reducing the incidence and severity of adverse outcomes.
