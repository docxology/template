**Overview/Summary**
The paper "An Active Inference perspective on Neurofeedback Training" presents a new approach to understanding neurofeedback training based on active inference theory. The authors argue that the traditional view of neurofeedback, which is based on the concept of closed-loop control, is too narrow and does not take into account the fact that the brain is an open system with many internal states and processes. They propose a new perspective that takes into account the internal state of the brain in addition to its external input. The authors use the term "neurofeedback" to refer to both the closed-loop control view and the open-loop, active inference view. In this paper, they focus on the latter. This is an important distinction because it makes a difference between the two views. The traditional neurofeedback training is based on the idea that the brain is a black box with no internal state. It is only the external input that can change the output of the system. The authors argue that this view does not take into account the fact that the brain has many internal states and processes, such as attention, motivation, and memory, which also affect the outcome of the training. This new perspective is based on the idea that the brain is an open system with many internal states and processes. In this paper, the authors focus on the active inference view.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The main contribution of the paper is to present a new perspective for understanding neurofeedback training based on the active inference theory. The authors provide a detailed explanation of how the brain works in an open-loop system with many internal states and processes. They also explain that the closed-loop control view of neurofeedback is too narrow because it does not take into account the fact that the brain has many internal states and processes, which are important for the training effect. The authors present a new perspective based on the active inference theory, which takes into account the internal state of the brain in addition to its external input.

**Methodology/Approach**
The approach used by the authors is based on the active inference theory. This is an open-loop system with many internal states and processes. In this paper, the authors focus on the active inference view. The authors explain that the traditional neurofeedback training is based on the closed-loop control theory. The authors provide a detailed explanation of how the brain works in an open-loop system with many internal states and processes. They also explain that the closed-loop control theory is too narrow because it does not take into account the fact that the brain has many internal states and processes, which are important for the training effect.

**Results/Data**
The authors present a detailed explanation of how the brain works in an open-loop system with many internal states and processes. They also explain that the closed-loop control theory is too narrow because it does not take into account the fact that the brain has many internal states and processes, which are important for the training effect.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The authors argue that the traditional view of neurofeedback based on the closed-loop control theory is too narrow. The new perspective based on the active inference theory takes into account the internal state of the brain in addition to its external input. This makes a difference between the two views. The authors explain that this new perspective is based on the idea that the brain is an open system with many internal states and processes. The authors also argue that the traditional neurofeedback training is too narrow because it does not take into account the fact that the brain has many internal states and processes, which are important for the training effect.
