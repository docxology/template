**Overview/Summary**

The paper by Lippera et al. (2022) [1] presents a theoretical study of the steady-state motion of an isotropic active colloid in the presence of a wall. The authors consider the case where the interfacial Marangoni stress is the only driving force for the self-propulsion, and they show that the wall can either enhance or suppress the propulsion depending on the concentration of the solute. They also study the effect of the lubrication limit, which is the regime where the velocity of the droplet is comparable to the velocity at which the Marangoni stress relaxes. In this case, the authors find an anomalous repulsion in the bulk limit.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contribution of the paper is a theoretical study of the steady-state motion of an isotropic active colloid near a wall. The authors consider the case where the interfacial Marangoni stress is the only driving force for the self-propulsion, and they show that the wall can either enhance or suppress the propulsion depending on the concentration of the solute. They also study the effect of the lubrication limit, which is the regime where the velocity of the droplet is comparable to the velocity at which the Marangoni stress relaxes. In this case, the authors find an anomalous repulsion in the bulk limit.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use a bipolar coordinate system for the analysis. The motion of the colloid can be described by the following equation: $d\theta/dt = - \frac{1}{2} (1 + 2 \cos \theta)$. The authors also consider the lubrication limit, where the velocity of the droplet is comparable to the velocity at which the Marangoni stress relaxes. In this case, the authors find an anomalous repulsion in the bulk limit.

**Results/Data**

The authors show that the wall can either enhance or suppress the propulsion depending on the concentration of the solute. They also study the effect of the lubrication limit, where the velocity of the droplet is comparable to the velocity at which the Marangoni stress relaxes. In this case, the authors find an anomalous repulsion in the bulk limit.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The paper does not discuss any limitations or future work. The authors do not mention any potential experimental difficulties or challenges that may be associated with their theoretical results. However, it is possible to imagine some of these as well as the fact that the authors only consider a single type of driving force for the self-propulsion.
