**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Refining Collective Coordinates and Improving Free Energy Representation" by [Authors] is a theoretical study on the development of an improved collective variable (CV) for the description of the protein dynamics in the phase space, which is essential to understand the biological functions. The authors propose a new CV that can be used to describe the protein conformations with higher accuracy and efficiency than the previous ones. This improvement is achieved by refining the definition of the CVs based on the free energy representation (FER) and the calculation of the FER for the protein dynamics. In this paper, the authors first introduce the concept of the FER that can be used to describe the protein conformations with a high accuracy and efficiency. Then, the authors refine the collective coordinates based on the FER by using the improved CVs as the new variables. The refined CVs are applied to the calculation of the free energy landscape (FEL) for the protein dynamics. The results show that the refined CVs can be used to describe the protein conformations with a higher accuracy than the previous ones and the FEL calculated based on the refined CVs is more accurate than the previous one.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors first introduce the concept of the free energy representation (FER) for the description of the protein dynamics. The FER is a probability distribution function that can be used to describe the protein conformations with a high accuracy and efficiency. It is also a new CV that can be used as the collective variable in the calculation of the FEL. In this paper, the authors first introduce the concept of the FER for the description of the protein dynamics. The FER is defined as the probability distribution function that the system (protein) will stay in the state 𝑠 at time 𝑡. The FER can be used to describe the protein conformations with a high accuracy and efficiency. It can also be used as the new CV that can be used for the description of the protein dynamics. Then, the authors refine the collective coordinates based on the FER by using the improved CVs as the new variables. The refined CVs are applied to the calculation of the free energy landscape (FEL) for the protein dynamics. The results show that the refined CVs can be used to describe the protein conformations with a higher accuracy than the previous ones and the FEL calculated based on the refined CVs is more accurate than the previous one.
