**Overview/Summary**
The paper "Exploring Action-Centric Representations Through the Query" is a work in progress by De Luan et al. that proposes a new approach for learning action-centric representations in multi-view scenarios. The authors argue that existing methods are not able to learn task-agnostic action representations because they are based on the idea of mutual information between the latent representation and the input data, which is too general to be useful for many tasks. Instead, the authors propose to define a query as the subset of information contained in the intersection of the input data and its transformation, and then use this query to learn action-centric representations. The paper starts by discussing the limitations of existing methods that are based on mutual information between the latent representation and the input data. They argue that there is no guarantee for an optimal lossy representation to be able to solve a set of tasks, because the mutual information does not depend on the specific query. Then, they introduce their approach that defines a query as the subset of information contained in the intersection of the input data and its transformation, and use this query to learn action-centric representations. The authors show the effectiveness of the proposed approach by comparing it with existing methods.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The main contributions of the paper are:
1. **Defining a query**: The authors define a query as the subset of information contained in the intersection of the input data and its transformation, which is different from the traditional definition that only depends on the mutual information between the latent representation and the input data.
2. **Learning action-centric representations**: The authors propose to use this query to learn action-centric representations. They show that the proposed approach can be used for learning task-agnostic action representations by using a set of queries that are relevant to different tasks.

**Methodology/Approach**
The authors first discuss the limitations of existing methods based on mutual information between the latent representation and the input data, which is too general to be useful for many tasks. Then, they introduce their approach that defines a query as the subset of information contained in the intersection of the input data and its transformation. The authors show the effectiveness of the proposed approach by comparing it with existing methods.
