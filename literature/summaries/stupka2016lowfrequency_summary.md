**Overview/Summary**

The presented research is a theoretical study of low-frequency electromagnetic field in a Wigner crystal. The authors consider the jellium (continuum) model of a solid by introducing an elasticity of electronic subsystem for a Wigner crystal, and find the longitudinal and two transversal low-frequency oscillation branches. They show that these sound oscillations in a Wigner crystal can be considered as the coupled waves of the electromagnetic field and charges which it is possible to study as the waves of the electromagnetic field in an environment. It gives phonons with necessary statistics after the standard quantization of the field.

**Results/Data**

The authors plot the low-frequency transversal mode (Fig. 1). The transition from linear sound dispersion for small wavevectors to nonlinear one for middle ones is shown in Fig. 1.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The author would like to thank unknown referee, Drs. O. V aneeva and O. Kovalchuk for useful comments and constructive suggestions.
