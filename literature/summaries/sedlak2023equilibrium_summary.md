**Overview/Summary**
The paper proposes a distributed learning framework for edge devices in an Edge-Cloud (Edge-Cloud) system where each device is equipped with a computing continuum that can be dynamically adjusted to achieve the optimal performance under different workloads and constraints. The authors first propose an Active Computing Continuum (ACC) model, which allows the computing resource of the device to be flexibly allocated according to the requirements of the tasks in the computing continuum. Then, they design an Edge-Cloud system where each edge device is equipped with a computing continuum that can be dynamically adjusted to achieve the optimal performance under different workloads and constraints. The authors also propose an Active Inference (AI) model for the computing continuum through which the computing resource of the device can be flexibly allocated according to the requirements of the tasks in the computing continuum. Finally, they design a distributed learning framework where each edge device is equipped with both an ACC and an AI. This paper makes three main contributions: 1) The authors propose an Active Computing Continuum (ACC) model that allows the computing resource of the device to be flexibly allocated according to the requirements of the tasks in the computing continuum; 2) They design a distributed learning framework where each edge device is equipped with both an ACC and an AI.
