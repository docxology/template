**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Planning to avoid ambiguous states through Gaussian approximations to variational Bayesian linear Gaussian state-space models" by Barber and Chiappa (2006) is a seminal work that provides an alternative approach for the inference of linear Gaussian state-space models. The main contribution of this paper is to show how the expected free energy can be computed in closed form, which is then used as the objective function for the variational Bayesian inference. In 

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contribution of this paper is to show how the expected free energy can be computed in closed form, which is then used as the objective function for the variational Bayesian inference. The authors also discuss the epistemic value of the expected free energy, i.e., what does it mean and why do we care about it. The key findings are that the expected free energy is a measure of the amount of information in the data, and that the optimal solution to the variational problem is the same as the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) for the model parameters.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors first introduce the concept of the epistemic value of the expected free energy. The paper then discusses how the expected free energy can be used in the inference and the computation of the optimal solution to the variational problem. The key idea is that the expected free energy is a measure of the amount of information in the data, which is the negative log-likelihood function for the model parameters. This concept has been widely applied in the field of machine learning.

**Results/Data**

The authors first show how the expected free energy can be computed in closed form. The key idea is to use the Gaussian approximation for the variational Bayesian inference. In this paper, the authors also discuss the epistemic value of the expected free energy and its relationship with the MLE. The results are that the expected free energy is a measure of the amount of information in the data, which is the negative log-likelihood function for the model parameters. The optimal solution to the variational problem is the same as the MLE.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The paper does not discuss the limitations and future work. The authors only provide an overview of the expected free energy and its relationship with the MLE, which can be used in the inference of the linear Gaussian state-space models. The authors do not discuss how to apply this approach for other types of models.
