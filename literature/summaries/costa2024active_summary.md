**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Active Inference as a Model of Agency" by [Authors] proposes a new perspective on active inference (AI) in the context of reinforcement learning (RL). The authors argue that AI is not just an efficient algorithm for solving RL problems, but rather it is a model of agency. This perspective is based on the idea that the agent's ability to make decisions and take actions is what makes the agent "real" - i.e., what gives the agent its agency. In this sense, the authors argue that AI can be seen as a form of "cognitive architecture" for the agent. The paper also provides an argument for why AI should be used in RL, rather than other algorithms, and it discusses some potential future work.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of the paper are two-fold. First, the authors provide a new perspective on AI as a model of agency. This is based on the idea that the agent's ability to make decisions and take actions is what makes the agent "real" - i.e., what gives the agent its agency. The second contribution is an argument for why AI should be used in RL, rather than other algorithms.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors argue that the key feature of AI which distinguishes it from other algorithms is that it is a form of cognitive architecture for the agent. This means that the agent's ability to make decisions and take actions is what makes the agent "real". The authors also provide an argument for why AI should be used in RL, rather than other algorithms.

**Results/Data**

The main results of the paper are the arguments made by the authors for the two contributions above. These are based on a number of key claims that the authors make about AI and its relation to agency. The first is that the agent's ability to make decisions and take actions is what makes the agent "real". The second is that AI should be used in RL, rather than other algorithms.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The main limitations of the paper are the lack of a formal definition of the model of agency that it proposes. The authors also do not discuss how their perspective on AI as a model of agency can be tested or evaluated. This is left for future work.
