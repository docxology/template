**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Ordinal Rating of Network Performance and Inference by Network Distance Prediction" is a research work on network inference that aims to address the scalable acquisition of end-to-end network performance by network distance prediction based on performance ratings. The authors investigate different matrix factorization models used in Recommender systems, particularly the solution that won the Netflix prize. By taking into account both the accuracy and the practicality, the simple regularized matrix factorization was adopted in the inference system. Experiments on peer selection demonstrate the benefit of network inference based on ratings to Internet applications.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this paper are:

1. The authors present a solution that can be used for scalable acquisition of end-to-end network performance by network distance prediction based on performance ratings.
2. They investigate different matrix factorization models used in Recommender systems, particularly the so-called Netflix prize winning solution.
3. By taking into account both the accuracy and the practicality, the simple regularized matrix factorization was adopted in the inference system.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors adopt a simple regularized matrix factorization model for network distance prediction. In this approach, the rating information is taken as the input of the network distance prediction algorithm. The rating- based method can be used to find better-performing paths than the metric-value-based and class-based methods. The rating information is more informative than the binary classes and allows to find better-performing paths. On the other hand, the rating information is qualitative and thus requires less measurement costs than the metric values.

**Results/Data**

The authors conduct experiments on peer selection based on value- based prediction, class-based prediction and their proposed rating-based prediction. The random peer selection is used as a baseline method for comparison. It can be seen that on the optimality, value-based prediction performs the best and the performance by rating-based prediction is better than that of class-based prediction. This shows that the rating information is a good comprise between metric values and binary classes.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors point out the limitations and future work as follows:

1. The accuracy requirement for network distance prediction is not explicitly stated in this paper.
2. The authors do not discuss how to improve the accuracy of the proposed method, such as by using more data or a better model.
3. The authors only conduct experiments on peer selection based on value-based prediction, class- based prediction and their proposed rating-based prediction.
