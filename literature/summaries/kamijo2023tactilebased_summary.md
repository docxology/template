**Overview/Summary**
The paper presents a novel approach to robotic manipulation for dense box-packing problems based on deep active inference (DAI). The authors propose an end-to-end DAI-based insertion framework that can be generalized to objects of unknown geometry, and demonstrate its effectiveness in both simulation and real-world environments. The main contributions are the use of DAI as a learning paradigm for force control and the design of a tactile- based DAIs architecture for dense box-packing.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The authors first introduce the concept of deep active inference (DAI) to robotics, which is a unified Bayesian learning framework that can be used in both perception and action. The DAI-based insertion approach is then presented as an end-to-end method, where the robot learns to control the force applied by its gripper during the insertion process. In this paper, the authors use the DAI to learn a policy for controlling the force of the insertion operation based on the tactile observation from the environment. The main finding is that the proposed approach can be generalized to objects of unknown geometry and outperform existing methods in both simulation and real-world environments.

**Methodology/Approach**
The authors first introduce the concept of deep active inference (DAI) as a unified Bayesian learning framework for perception and action, which is based on the free energy principle. The DAI-based insertion approach is then presented as an end-to-end method, where the robot learns to control the force applied by its gripper during the insertion process. In this paper, the authors use the DAI to learn a policy for controlling the force of the insertion operation based on the tactile observation from the environment. The main contribution is that the proposed approach can be generalized to objects of unknown geometry and outperform existing methods in both simulation and real-world environments.

**Results/Data**
The results are presented as follows: 1) The authors first introduce a DAI-based insertion framework for dense box-packing, which is an end-to-end method. In this paper, the authors use the DAI to learn a policy for controlling the force of the insertion operation based on the tactile observation from the environment. The main finding is that the proposed approach can be generalized to objects of unknown geometry and outperform existing methods in both simulation and real-world environments.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The limitations are discussed as follows: 1) This paper only presents a DAI-based insertion framework for dense box-packing, which is an end-to-end method. The main finding is that the proposed approach can be generalized to objects of unknown geometry and outperform existing methods in both simulation and real-world environments.
