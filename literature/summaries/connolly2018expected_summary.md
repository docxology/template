**Overview/Summary**

The present paper provides a new perspective on the process of defense in psychoanalytic theory by using the formalism of the free energy principle (FEP) to describe the underlying conflict that is resolved through the process of defense. The FEP, which has been developed for use in physics and computer science, is applied to the process of action selection in the brain. In this context, a policy of action is an inference about what will happen if one performs a particular action. A policy is said to be "optimal" when it reduces the free energy (FE) associated with the situation. The FEP is also used in the context of active inference where the optimal policy is the best-estimate state that can be inferred from the available information. In this case, the FE is a measure of the surprise or uncertainty associated with the current state and the available information. A process of conﬂict arises when different policies are available for action selection and these have similar levels of free energy. The FEP provides a formal deﬁnition of conﬂict that can be applied to any situation where there is more than one possible policy, which may be thought of as the "optimal" policy. The paper also discusses how this process of conﬂict can be resolved through an alteration in the relative "precisions" of the demands associated with different emotion systems.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contribution of the paper is to provide a formal deﬁnition of conﬂict that can be applied to any situation where there are multiple possible policies. This deﬁnition is based on the FEP and is also used in the context of active inference, which is a process of action selection. The FEP provides a formal deﬁnition of conﬂict that can be applied to any situation where there are more than one possible policy. The paper also discusses how this process of conﬂict can be resolved through an alteration in the relative "precisions" of the demands associated with different emotion systems.

**Methodology/Approach**

The approach used by the authors is based on the FEP, which has been developed for use in physics and computer science. The FEP is also used in the context of active inference where the optimal policy is the best-estimate state that can be inferred from the available information. In this case, the FE is a measure of the surprise or uncertainty associated with the current state and the available information. A process of conﬂict arises when different policies are available for action selection and these have similar levels of free energy. The FEP provides a formal deﬁnition of conﬂict that can be applied to any situation where there are more than one possible policy, which may be thought of as the "optimal" policy. The paper also discusses how this process of conﬂict can be resolved through an alteration in the relative "precisions" of the demands associated with different emotion systems.

**Results/Data**

The authors use the example of a child's response to a caregiver in the strange situation, which is a paradigm used by attachment researchers. The FEP provides a formal deﬁnition of conﬂict that can be applied to any situation where there are more than one possible policy. This deﬁnition is also used in the context of active inference, which is a process of action selection. The FEP provides a formal deﬁnition of conﬂict that can be applied to any situation where there are more than one possible policy, which may be thought of as the "optimal" policy. The paper also discusses how this process of conﬂict can be resolved through an alteration in the relative "precisions" of the demands associated with different emotion systems.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors' use of the FEP to describe the process of defense is a new perspective on the psychoanalytic process. This perspective provides a formal deﬁnition of conﬂict that can be applied to any situation where there are multiple possible policies, which may be thought of as the "optimal" policy. The paper also discusses how this process of conﬂict can be resolved through an alteration in the relative "precisions" of the demands associated with different emotion systems.
