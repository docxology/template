**Overview/Summary**
The paper presents a new approach to multi-resolution coordinate system for neural networks (ASMR) and applies it to three different problems in the field of neural generative models. The authors claim that their method can be used as a drop-in replacement for existing methods such as SIREN, KiloNeRF, and Instant-NGP. The paper is organized into six sections: Introduction, Key Contributions/Findings, Methodology/Approach, Results/Data, Limitations/Discussion, and Conclusion.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The main contributions of the paper are the ASMR method and its applications to three different problems in the field of neural generative models. The authors claim that their approach can be used as a drop-in replacement for existing methods such as SIREN, KiloNeRF, and Instant-NGP.

**Methodology/Approach**
The first part of the paper is an introduction to the problem of multi-resolution coordinate systems in neural networks. The authors explain how these different coordinate systems are used in three different generative models: SIREN (SIREN), KiloNeRF (KiloNeRF), and Instant-NGP (Instant-NGP). They then describe their new approach, ASMR (ASMR), which is a multi-resolution coordinate system that can be used as a drop-in replacement for the existing methods. The authors explain how they use the different coordinate systems in the three generative models. The first part of the paper also describes the SIREN and KiloNeRF methods. The second part of the paper describes the ASMR method, which is an activation-sharing multi-resolution coordinate system that can be used as a drop-in replacement for the existing methods. The authors explain how they use the different coordinate systems in the three generative models.

**Results/Data**
The third section of the paper presents the results and data from the three problems. The first part of this section is an overview of the SIREN, KiloNeRF, and Instant-NGP approaches. The second part of this section describes the experimental design for the three applications: natural image fitting (Section 3.2), audio fitting (Section 3.3), and megapixel image fitting (Section 3.4). The authors then present the results from the three problems. The first part of this section is an overview of the SIREN, KiloNeRF, and Instant-NGP approaches. The second part of this section describes the experimental design for the three applications: natural image fitting (Section 3.2), audio fitting (Section 3.3), and megapixel image fitting (Section 3.4). The authors then present the results from the three problems.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The fourth section of the paper is a discussion of the limitations and future work. The first part of this section is an overview of the SIREN, KiloNeRF, and Instant-NGP approaches. The second part of this section describes the experimental design for the three applications: natural image fitting (Section 3.2), audio fitting (Section 3.3), and megapixel image fitting (Section 3.4). The authors then present the results from the three problems.

**Conclusion**
The final section of the paper is a conclusion. The authors summarize their main contributions and describe how they can be used as a drop-in replacement for existing methods such as SIREN, KiloNeRF, and Instant-NGP. The authors also claim that the ASMR method has some benefits compared to the existing approaches.
