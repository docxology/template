**Overview/Summary**

The present paper is a foundational work in the area of compositional active inference (CAI), which is an extension of the classical Bayesian active inference approach. The authors propose a new framework for CAI that can be used to model complex, hierarchical systems and their interactions with the environment. In particular, they provide a unified treatment of the dynamics of the system's internal state and its external behavior in the presence of both observation and action. This is achieved by using a single, probabilistic representation that captures the generative process of the system's internal state and its external behavior, which can be used to model complex systems such as cells in an organism, organisms in societies, and societies in ecosystems. The authors also consider the processes by which these choice processes are chosen, and how they may be improved. This is achieved by using a single, probabilistic representation that captures the generative process of the system's internal state and its external behavior.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this paper are the following: (1) A new framework for compositional active inference that can be used to model complex systems; (2) The authors provide a unified treatment of the dynamics of the system's internal state and its external behavior in the presence of both observation and action. This is achieved by using a single, probabilistic representation that captures the generative process of the system's internal state and its external behavior; (3) The authors also consider the processes by which these choice processes are chosen, and how they may be improved.

**Methodology/Approach**

The approach in this paper is based on the use of a single, probabilistic representation that captures the generative process of the system's internal state and its external behavior. This is achieved by using a new form of graphical model called a compositional graphical model (CGM). The CGMs are defined as a set of nodes with an associated graph structure in which the nodes can be either observation, action or internal state. The authors also consider the processes by which these choice processes are chosen, and how they may be improved.

**Results/Data**

The results of this paper include the following: (1) A new form of graphical model called a compositional graphical model; (2) A unified treatment of the dynamics of the system's internal state and its external behavior in the presence of both observation and action. This is achieved by using a single, probabilistic representation that captures the generative process of the system's internal state and its external behavior.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The limitations of this paper are the following: (1) The authors do not consider the full structure that emerges when iterating the Paraconstruction; (2) The authors also do not address the question of how to use the framework for modeling complex, hierarchical systems. This is because the full structure is not yet well understood.
