**Overview/Summary**

The NIFTY (Numerical Information Field Theory) way of Bayesian signal inference is a new approach to statistical inference that combines the advantages of the maximum entropy principle with the power of the Bayesian paradigm. The paper presents an overview of the NIFTY framework and its application in the context of denoising, deconvolving, and decomposing photon observations. In this work, the authors discuss the theoretical foundations of the NIFTY approach and present a comprehensive review of the results obtained with the D3PO (Denosing, Deconvolution, Decomposing) algorithm that is part of the NIFTY package.
