**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Public Policymaking for International Agricultural Trade using Association Rule Learning" is a research study in the field of international trade and policy making. The authors propose an approach to public policymaking that uses association rule learning (AR) to identify associations between countries' agricultural policies and their outcomes, such as tariffs, and the impact on international agricultural trade. The main contributions are: 1) the application of AR for the analysis of the relationship between countries' agricultural policies and their outcomes in the context of public policymaking; 2) the use of HS4 and HS6 codes to analyze the relationships between commodities' trade with different countries, and 3) the use of ARs to influence production decisions at farm level, provide commodity-based tariff insights, and other potential pointers to economic policies. The authors also highlight some future work that they aim to explore in their research.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main findings are: 1) the application of AR for the analysis of the relationship between countries' agricultural policies and their outcomes in the context of public policymaking; 2) the use of HS4 and HS6 codes to analyze the relationships between commodities' trade with different countries, and 3) the use of ARs to influence production decisions at farm level, provide commodity-based tariff insights, and other potential pointers to economic policies. The authors also highlight some future work that they aim to explore in their research.

**Methodology/Approach**

The approach is based on association rule learning (AR), which is a data-driven method for discovering the relationships between variables. The HS4 and HS6 codes are used to analyze the relationships between commodities' trade with different countries, and ARs are used to influence production decisions at farm level, provide commodity-based tariff insights, and other potential pointers to economic policies.

**Results/Data**

The authors use a dataset of agricultural tariffs from 1995-2017. The results show that: 1) the application of AR for the analysis of the relationship between countries' agricultural policies and their outcomes in the context of public policymaking; 2) the use of HS4 and HS6 codes to analyze the relationships between commodities' trade with different countries, and 3) the use of ARs to influence production decisions at farm level, provide commodity-based tariff insights, and other potential pointers to economic policies. The authors also highlight some future work that they aim to explore in their research.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The limitations are: 1) the data used is only from 1995-2017; 2) the data used is only for agricultural tariffs; 3) the data is not about the relationship between countries' policies and outcomes, but rather the relationship between commodities' trade with different countries. The authors also highlight some future work that they aim to explore in their research.
