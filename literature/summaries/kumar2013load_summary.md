**Overview/Summary**
This 2013 paper by Ranjan Kumar and G. Sahoo proposes a load balancing algorithm for cloud computing using an ant colony optimization (ACO) approach. The authors are motivated to apply the ACO method in this context because it is known to be effective in solving complex combinatorial optimization problems, such as scheduling tasks on multiple processors or finding optimal paths in networks. In the paper, a load balancing mechanism based on ACO and complex network theory is proposed for an open cloud computing federation (OCCF). The authors first introduce the OCCF framework and then describe the basic idea of the ACO algorithm. They also analyze the performance of the ACO method by simulation experiments.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The main contribution of this paper is a load balancing mechanism based on ACO and complex network theory in an open cloud computing federation (OCCF). The authors use the ACO algorithm to find the optimal scheduling strategy for the OCCF. In the ACO algorithm, ants deposit pheromone when they move from one node to another. This paper shows that as the number of ants increases, the amount of pheromone also increases, since most of the ants use the same path. The authors compare the performance of the proposed load balancing mechanism with a traditional random scheduling method and find that the ACO algorithm is more effective in terms of the average response time.

**Methodology/Approach**
The authors first introduce the OCCF framework and then describe the basic idea of the ACO algorithm. They also analyze the performance of the ACO method by simulation experiments. The authors use a cloud computing environment with 10 job schedulers and 44 different web services. The number of ants in this simulation varies from 1 to 1000. These ants deposit some amount of pheromone in their move. The load of each node is calculated based on the number of jobs that are assigned to it. The authors use a window with 64-bit operating system, i3 processor, 370 M processor, 2.40 GHz of speed and 3 GB memory. They also use C++ as the programming language for the simulation. The load of each node is calculated based on the number of jobs that are assigned to it.

**Results/Data**
The authors have experimented by taking different amount of number of ants. The amount of pheromone varies between 0 and 1. The table I shows the number of ants and the am ount of pheromone deposited. From the table I, we see that as the number of ants increases, the amount of pheromone also increases, Since most of the ants uses the same path. The figure I shows the graph of Table I.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The authors have used a cloud computing environment with 10 job schedulers and 44 different web services in their simulation. The number of ants in this simulation varies from 1 to 1000. These ants deposit some amount of pheromone in there move. The load of each node is calculated based on the number of jobs that are assigned to it. The authors use a window with 64-bit operating system, i3 processor, 370 M processor, 2.40 GHz of speed and 3 GB memory. They also use C++ as the programming language for the simulation. The load of each node is calculated based on the number of jobs that are assigned to it.
