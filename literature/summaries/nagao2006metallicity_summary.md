**Overview/Summary**
The authors of this research paper investigate the evolution of the gas metallicity in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and its dependence on luminosity and redshift. The authors compile large spectroscopic datasets of broad- and narrow-line AGNs, and compare them with the results of their photoionization models. Through the analysis of both the broad and the narrow emission-line regions, they find that: (1) for a given luminosity, there is no redshift dependence of the gas metallicity; (2) for a given redshift, there is a significant correlation between the gas metallicity and luminosity; (3) the luminosity-metallicity relation does not show any evolution in the redshift range 2 ∼< z∼< 4.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The authors find that the BLR metallicity of quasars depends primarily on the luminosity, while for a given quasar luminosity there is no significant metallicity evolution within the redshift range 2.0 ≤ z ≤ 4.5. The absence of the metallicity evolution up to z ∼ 4.5 may suggest that the active star-formation epoch of quasar host galaxies occurred at z > 7, inferred by timescale required for the enrichment of some elements such as C and Si (produced mainly by low- or intermediate-mass evolved stars). The authors also find a trend for more luminous radio galaxies to have more metal-rich gas in their narrow-line regions. They use the NLR metallicity-sensitive emission line ratios, C iv/Heii and C iii]/Civ, to investigate the evolution of the NLR metallicity at 1.2 ≤ z ≤ 3.8. The authors find that most of the flux ratios are inconsistent with shock models, suggesting that the NLRs of radio galaxies are mainly photoionized. Regardless of the specific interpretation, the observational data do not show any evidence for a significant evolution of the gas metallicity in the NLRs within the redshift range 1.2 ≤ z ≤ 3.8. Instead, they find a trend for more luminous radio galaxies to have more metal-rich gas in their narrow-line regions, which is in agreement with the same finding in the studies of the broad-line regions including theirs.

**Methodology/Approach**
The authors use the C iv and He ii emission line ratios as diagnostics of the NLR metallicity. The C iii] and C iv lines are both sensitive to the ionization state of the gas, while the He ii is a temperature-insensitive indicator of the number of He 2+ ions. The C iv/Heii ratio is expected to be sensitive to the NLR gas metallicity. This is because the g as temperature decreases when the metallicity increases and thus the colli sional excitation of C iv is gradually suppressed, while the He ii luminosity is basically proportional to the number of He 2+ ionizing photons and thus rather insensitive to the metalli city. The C iii]/Civ ratio is instead sensitive to the ionization degree and ther efore it is used to check any dependence of C iv/Heii on the ionization state of the gas. As a result, a diagnostic diagram that consists of these two flux ratios is quite useful to estimate the NLR metallicity, without the need to rely on weak emission lines such as N v (see also Groves et al., 2004). The authors use the Cloudy photoionization model (Ferland et al., 1998) assuming one-zone, dust-free clouds. Note that NLR clouds emitting relatively high ionization lines are expected to be dust-fee (see, e.g., Marconi et al., 1994; Nagao et al., 2003). The photoionization models provide two possible scenarios which are consistent with the observed data: low-density gas clouds (nH ∼< 10^3 cm^-3) with a sub-solar metallicity (0.2 ≤ Zgas/Z⊙ ≤ 1.0), or high-density gas clouds (nH ∼ 10^5 cm^-3) with a wide range of gas metallicity (0.2 ≤ Zgas/Z⊙ ≤ 5.0). Regardless of the specific interpretation, the observational data do not show any evidence for a signi cant evolution of the gas metallicity in the NLRs within the redshift range 1.2 ≤ z ≤ 3.8.

**Results/Data**
The authors find that there is no significant evolution of the gas metallicity in the NLRs within the redshift range 1.2 ≤ z ≤ 3.8. Instead, they find a trend for more luminous radio galaxies to have more metal-rich gas in their narrow-line regions, which is in agreement with the same finding in the studies of the broad-line regions including theirs.

**Limitations/Discussion**
Regardless of the specific interpretation, the observational data do not show any evidence for a signi cant evolution of the gas metallicity in the NLRs within the redshift range 1.2 ≤ z ≤ 3.8. Instead, they find a trend for more luminous radio galaxies to have more metal-rich gas in their narrow-line regions, which is in agreement with the same finding in the studies of the broad-line regions including theirs.
