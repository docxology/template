**Overview/Summary**
The paper proposes a new optimization algorithm called "Herder Ants" (HA) for solving the ant colony optimization problem. The HA is an extension of the classical ant colony optimization (ACO) metaheuristic that uses ants to find optimal solutions in complex problems. The authors claim that the HA outperforms the ACO on several benchmark instances.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The key contributions and findings are the following:
- A new algorithm called "Herder Ants" is proposed for solving the ant colony optimization problem.
- The HA uses ants to find optimal solutions in complex problems. 
- The authors claim that the HA outperforms the ACO on several benchmark instances.

**Methodology/Approach**
The approach used by the authors is as follows:
- The authors propose a new algorithm called "Herder Ants" (HA) for solving the ant colony optimization problem.
- The HA uses ants to find optimal solutions in complex problems. 
- The authors claim that the HA outperforms the ACO on several benchmark instances.

**Results/Data**
The results are as follows:
- The absolute performance of the DMKP benchmark instance is the sum of each state's result profits. 
- The total profit sum is a good overall performance indication because each state equally contributes to the final result.
- A profit improvement of any state's result directly improves the total profit. 
- The result gap can be calculated for any single solution and plotted on a graph. 
- Also, dynamic algorithm performance can be measured using the difference in the result gap that occurs after the dynamic change called the "gap slip". 
- Although gap slip is not a primary objective of the optimization, it indicates how well the optimization algorithm tackles a dynamic problem and should be minimized.
- The authors perform quantitative analysis across all benchmark instances using "result gap" and "gap slip" metrics. 
- The average result gap and average gap slip values of each dynamic benchmark dataset are calculated from all dynamic states, as shown in Figure 10. 
- The best-known results are taken from a verified public repository [59]. Furthermore, all presented experimental measurements are the averages taken from 10 algorithm runs, and the standard deviation of the result gap is calculated to prove statistical significance.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The limitations or future work are as follows:
- ACO with Aphids strategy presents with four new Aphids functions with tuneable parameters, as shown in Figure 9. 
- These parameters must be carefully tuned to maximize the performance of proposed algorithm.
- Meanwhile, Full-Restart and Pheromone-Strategy do not have additional functions with tuneable parameters, and all shared hyper-parameters are implemented within the same baseline ACO core algorithm, solving static MKP benchmarks [58]. 
- High-quality MKP solutions were possible to achieve by utilizing a dynamic impact evaluation method in the ACO edge's probability calculation. Also, this baseline ACO algorithm implementation efficiently utilizes modern multicore computer architectures by running multiple ant searches in parallel within one iteration and synchronizing before the pheromone update.
- The authors claim that the HA outperforms the ACO on several benchmark instances.
