**Overview/Summary**

The paper discusses a novel approach to the f(R) theory in the context of the agegraphic dark energy (AGEGAE) and the cosmological constant. The authors consider the f(R) gravity as an alternative to the standard general relativity, which is based on the assumption that the action is a function only of the Riemann curvature scalar. They assume that the action is a function of the Ricci tensor invariants in addition to the Riemann one and use this approach to construct the f(R) cosmological model. The authors also discuss the possibility of the existence of the dark energy in the context of the f(R) theory.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main result is that the f(R) gravity can be used to explain the observed evolution of the Hubble parameter and the deceleration parameter. In the framework of the f(R) cosmology, the agegraphic dark energy (AGEGAE) is a natural consequence of the model. The authors also show that the f(R) theory can explain the recent observations on the baryon acoustic oscillations in the redshift space. They find that the f(R) gravity can be used to explain the observed data without any additional parameter.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use the Ricci tensor invariants as a starting point and assume that the action is a function of these invariants, which leads to the f(R) theory. The authors also assume that the universe is spatially flat and homogeneous. In this case, the Friedmann equation can be written as

$$ H^2 = \frac{8\pi}{3} \rho + 1, $$

where $H$ is the Hubble parameter and $\rho$ is the energy density of the matter. The authors also assume that the universe is in a steady state with no spatial curvature. In this case, the deceleration parameter can be written as

$$ q = -\frac{\dot{H}}{H} = \frac{1}{2}, $$

where $\dot{H}$ is the time derivative of the Hubble parameter. The authors also use the following dimensionless variables:

$$ \Omega_m = \frac{\rho_m}{\rho_0}, \quad \Omega_r = \frac{\rho_r}{\rho_0}, \quad \Omega_{DE} = \frac{\rho_{DE}}{\rho_0}, $$

where $\rho$ is the total energy density, and $\rho_i$ ($i=m,r,DE$) is the energy density of the $i^{th}$ component. The authors also assume that the equation of state parameter for the matter is $w_m = 0$, which leads to

$$ \Omega_m + \Omega_r = 1. $$

The authors then find the following relation between the Hubble and deceleration parameters:

$$ q = -\frac{1}{2} = \frac{\dot{H}}{H}. $$

**Results/Data**

The authors show that in the f(R) cosmology, the dark energy is a natural consequence of the model. The authors also find that the f(R) gravity can explain the observed data without any additional parameter. They use the following dimensionless variables:

$$ \Omega_m = 0.3, \quad \Omega_r = 0.7, \quad \Omega_{DE} = 0.6. $$

The authors then find the following relation between the Hubble and deceleration parameters in this case:

$$ q = -\frac{1}{2}. $$

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors point out that the f(R) theory can be used to explain the observed data without any additional parameter. The authors also mention the possibility of the existence of the dark energy in the context of the f(R) theory.
