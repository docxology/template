**Overview/Summary**

This paper presents a novel approach to understanding the reading process by integrating large language models and active inference. The authors first review the dual-route theory of reading, which posits that the human brain has two routes for processing written text: an orthographic (or phonological) route and a semantic route. The former is based on the visual form of the text, while the latter is based on the meaning of the text. The authors argue that the dual-route theory does not fully capture the complexity of the reading process because it does not take into account the active inference process. Active inference is the process by which the reader uses prior knowledge to make predictions about what they will read and then updates their knowledge as new information becomes available. The authors propose a model based on this process that can be used for both single words and sentences, and also for novel words and sentences.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contribution of the paper is the development of an active inference model that uses large language models to simulate the reading process. This approach is different from previous work in the field because it integrates the dual-route theory with the active inference process. The authors first review the dual-route theory, which posits that the human brain has two routes for processing written text: an orthographic (or phonological) route and a semantic route. The former is based on the visual form of the text, while the latter is based on the meaning of the text. The authors argue that the dual-route theory does not fully capture the complexity of the reading process because it does not take into account the active inference process. Active inference is the process by which the reader uses prior knowledge to make predictions about what they will read and then updates their knowledge as new information becomes available. The authors propose a model based on this process that can be used for both single words and sentences, and also for novel words and sentences.

**Methodology/Approach**

The approach in the paper is based on the active inference process. This process is based on the idea of using prior knowledge to make predictions about what will be read and then updating one's knowledge as new information becomes available. The authors first describe the dual-route theory, which posits that the human brain has two routes for processing written text: an orthographic (or phonological) route and a semantic route. The former is based on the visual form of the text, while the latter is based on the meaning of the text. The authors argue that the dual-route theory does not fully capture the complexity of the reading process because it does not take into account the active inference process. Active inference is the process by which the reader uses prior knowledge to make predictions about what they will read and then updates their knowledge as new information becomes available. The authors propose a model based on this process that can be used for both single words and sentences, and also for novel words and sentences.

**Results/Data**

The results of the paper are presented in three simulations. In the first simulation, the authors test the active inference model by comparing it to a control model with no noise. The second simulation tests the effect of the amount of noise on the reading process. The third simulation is based on novel words and sentences that do not appear in the BERT vocabulary.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The main weakness of the paper is that the authors only test their approach on a small set of data, which may not be representative of all possible texts. For example, they use a single dataset for training and testing. The authors also note that the DM model generates a relatively high number of regressive (backward) saccades. This occurs because the model often loses contextual information and must backtrack to earlier words in the sentence to reestablish it. However, this pattern is not commonly observed in dyslexic readers  ([12, Fig. 3d]), and the reasons for this discrepancy remain to be explored.
