**Overview/Summary**
The paper "Emission- Line versus Continuum Correlations in Active Galactic Nuclei" by Netzer et al. (2007) is a comprehensive study of the Baldwin effect and its possible physical explanation. The authors investigate the correlations between the broad-line region (BLR) Hβ and [O III] 5007, Mg II 2800, and Fe II 4584 emission lines with the 1356 nm continuum in the rest frame of the active galactic nucleus (AGN). They find that the observed Baldwin effect is not a single phenomenon. The authors suggest that the 4000-7000 Å range is dominated by the "reverberation" effect, where the line and the continuum are both variable. The 2000-4000 Å range is likely to be the "virialization" effect, which is a new name for the Baldwin effect. They also find that the virialization effect is not a single phenomenon either; the [O III] 5007 and Hβ lines have different slopes than the Mg II line. The authors suggest that the differences in the slopes of the three lines are due to the difference in the ionizing continuum, which is the source of the recombination radiation. They propose that the observed virialization effect is caused by the increase of the 4th power of the temperature at the last scattering surface (T4) for the [O III] and Hβ lines, but the 5th power for the Mg II line. The authors also find a possible explanation for the difference in the slopes between the [O III] and Hβ lines.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The main contributions of this paper are the finding that the observed Baldwin effect is not a single phenomenon; the 4000-7000 Å range is dominated by the "reverberation" effect, where the line and the continuum are both variable. The 2000-4000 Å range is likely to be the "virialization" effect, which is a new name for the Baldwin effect. They also find that the virialization effect is not a single phenomenon either; the [O III] 5007 and Hβ lines have different slopes than the Mg II line. The authors suggest that the differences in the slopes of the three lines are due to the difference in the ionizing continuum, which is the source of the recombination radiation. They propose that the observed virialization effect is caused by the increase of the 4th power of the temperature at the last scattering surface (T4) for the [O III] and Hβ lines, but the 5th power for the Mg II line. The authors also find a possible explanation for the difference in the slopes between the [O III] and Hβ lines.

**Methodology/Approach**
The authors use the data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to study the Baldwin effect. They select 1,440 AGN with redshifts less than 0.8 and a signal-to-noise ratio of at least 3 in all three emission lines. The authors also find that the [O III] 5007 and Hβ lines have different slopes than the Mg II line. The authors suggest that the differences in the slopes between the [O III] and Hβ lines are due to the difference in the ionizing continuum, which is the source of the recombination radiation. They propose that the observed virialization effect is caused by the increase of the 4th power of the temperature at the last scattering surface (T4) for the [O III] and Hβ lines, but the 5th power for the Mg II line.

**Results/Data**
The authors find a possible explanation for the difference in the slopes between the [O III] and Hβ lines. The authors also find that the observed virialization effect is caused by the increase of the 4th power of the temperature at the last scattering surface (T4) for the [O III] and Hβ lines, but the 5th power for the Mg II line.
