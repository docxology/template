**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Self-Propulsive Active Nematics" by [Authors] presents a new class of self-propelled active matter that is distinct from the well-studied polar and nematic active matter. The authors show that this novel class of active matter can exhibit both half-integer and full-integer topological defects, which are not possible in the previously studied classes. The paper also provides an experimental demonstration of the existence of these topological defects.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contribution of the paper is the discovery of a new class of self-propelled active matter that can exhibit both half-integer and full-integer topological defects. This is achieved by using a combination of polar and nematic order in the same system, which is not possible for the previously studied classes. The authors show that this new class of active matter exhibits a rich variety of defect dynamics, including the existence of a new type of half-integer topological defect, which they call "polar-nematic" defects. This new class of active matter can also exhibit a novel type of full-integer topological defect, which is called "polar-nematic" skyrmions. The authors use the concept of an "inertia tensor" to describe the dynamics of this new class of active matter. They show that the polar-nematic defects are the only stable defects in the system and that they can be created by a process known as "defect unbinding". The paper also provides an experimental demonstration of the existence of these topological defects, which is achieved by using a combination of polar and nematic order in the same system. This new class of active matter has many potential applications.
