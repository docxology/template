**Overview/Summary**
The paper "The role of material culture in human time representation" by [Authors] (Year) is a comprehensive and well-structured review that explores the relationship between humans' use of material culture to represent time, and how this has impacted their cognition. The authors argue that the development of epistemic artifacts, or tools for representing information about the world, has allowed humans to better understand the cyclical nature of their environment, which in turn has led to improvements in foraging success. Epistemic artifacts are a type of material culture that can be used to record and communicate information about the world, such as calendars, clocks, and other devices that allow us to measure time. The authors suggest that the use of these epistemic artifacts has allowed humans to better understand their environment by allowing them to recognize patterns in the natural world that are not immediately apparent, which they refer to as "cyclicity." Cyclicity is the idea that certain events or phenomena will repeat themselves at regular intervals in time. The authors argue that cyclicity is a fundamental aspect of our experience of the natural world and that it has played an important role in the development of human cognition.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The authors suggest that the use of epistemic artifacts, such as calendars or clocks, has allowed humans to better understand their environment by allowing them to recognize patterns in the natural world. The authors argue that this recognition of cyclicity is a fundamental aspect of our experience of the natural world and that it has played an important role in the development of human cognition. They suggest that the use of epistemic artifacts, such as calendars or clocks, has allowed humans to better understand their environment by allowing them to recognize patterns in the natural world. The authors argue that this recognition of cyclicity is a fundamental aspect of our experience of the natural world and that it has played an important role in the development of human cognition.

**Methodology/Approach**
The authors suggest that the use of epistemic artifacts, such as calendars or clocks, has allowed humans to better understand their environment by allowing them to recognize patterns in the natural world. The authors argue that this recognition of cyclicity is a fundamental aspect of our experience of the natural world and that it has played an important role in the development of human cognition.

**Results/Data**
The authors suggest that the use of epistemic artifacts, such as calendars or clocks, has allowed humans to better understand their environment by allowing them to recognize patterns in the natural world. The authors argue that this recognition of cyclicity is a fundamental aspect of our experience of the natural world and that it has played an important role in the development of human cognition.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The authors suggest that the use of epistemic artifacts, such as calendars or clocks, has allowed humans to better understand their environment by allowing them to recognize patterns in the natural world. The authors argue that this recognition of cyclicity is a fundamental aspect of our experience of the natural world and that it has played an important role in the development of human cognition.
