Summary of "Social inhibition maintains adaptivity and consensus of foraging"

**Overview/Summary**

The paper studies a simple model of foraging in social insect colonies, where the number of foragers is regulated by the interaction between individual bees and the food source. The authors show that the presence of self-inhibition (i.e., negative feedback) in the system can lead to a stable consensus state with an arbitrary fraction of the colony foraging, which would be impossible without this feedback. This result holds even when the number of foragers is not fixed but fluctuates periodically as a function of time. The main finding is that the self-inhibition maintains adaptivity and consensus in such systems.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The key contributions of the paper are the results on the existence of stable consensus states with arbitrary fraction of the colony foraging, which can be achieved by introducing self-inhibition into the system. This result holds even when the number of foragers is not fixed but fluctuates periodically as a function of time. The authors also show that the self-inhibition maintains adaptivity and consensus in such systems.

**Methodology/Approach**

The paper studies a simple model of foraging in social insect colonies, where the number of foragers is regulated by the interaction between individual bees and the food source. The authors introduce self-inhibition into the system to show that it can lead to a stable consensus state with an arbitrary fraction of the colony foraging.

**Results/Data**

The paper shows that the self-inhibition maintains adaptivity and consensus in such systems. The main results are summarized in equations (14) and (15).

**Limitations/Discussion**

The paper does not discuss any limitations or future work.
