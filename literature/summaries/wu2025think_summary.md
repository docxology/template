**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Think How Your Teammates Think: Active Inference" is a research work in the field of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) that proposes an approach to learn teammates' behavior by inferring their goals and subgoals. The authors argue that the current MARL approaches are not robust enough, as they do not consider the uncertainty of the environment and the teammates' actions. In this paper, the authors propose a novel framework called "Active Inference" (AI) which is based on the idea of "thinking how your teammate thinks". This approach can be used to learn teammates' behavior by inferring their goals and subgoals in an online manner without requiring any additional information about the environment or the teammates. The authors claim that this is the first work that learns teammates' behavior in a fully decentralized way, i.e., the AI framework does not require any centralized knowledge of the environment or the teammates. This paper is organized as follows: the overview and summary are presented here; the key contributions and findings are discussed next; the methodology and approach are described after that; the results and data are then analyzed; finally, the limitations and discussion are given.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contribution of this work is a novel framework called "Active Inference" (AI) for learning teammates' behavior. The authors claim that AI is the first fully decentralized MARL approach. This is because the current MARL approaches require some centralized knowledge about the environment or the teammates, which is not available in many real-world scenarios. For example, in a multi-agent game, the teammates may have different goals and subgoals. In this case, it is difficult to learn the teammates' behavior without any additional information. The authors also claim that AI can be used for learning both the teammates' behavior and the environment's dynamics. The authors argue that the current MARL approaches do not consider the uncertainty of the environment and the teammates' actions. This is because the current MARL approaches are based on the idea of "thinking how you think", i.e., they assume that the agents can learn their own goals and subgoals by observing the other agents' behavior, but this does not take into account the uncertainty of the environment or the teammates' actions. The authors also claim that AI is more robust than the current MARL approaches in terms of learning both the teammates' behavior and the environment's dynamics. In addition, the authors claim that AI can be used for learning both the teammates' behavior and the environment's dynamics.

**Methodology/Approach**

The proposed AI framework is based on the idea of "thinking how your teammate thinks". The authors argue that this approach can be used to learn the teammates' behavior in an online manner without requiring any additional information about the environment or the teammates. This is because the current MARL approaches are not robust enough, as they do not consider the uncertainty of the environment and the teammates' actions. In this paper, the authors propose a novel framework called "Active Inference" (AI) for learning the teammates' behavior by inferring their goals and subgoals in an online manner without requiring any additional information about the environment or the teammates. The proposed AI is based on the idea that the agents can learn their own goals and subgoals by observing the other agents' behavior, but this does not take into account the uncertainty of the environment or the teammates' actions. This is because the current MARL approaches are based on the idea of "thinking how you think", i.e., they assume that the agents can learn their own goals and subgoals by observing the other agents' behavior, but this does not take into account the uncertainty of the environment or the teammates' actions. The authors also claim that AI is more robust than the current MARL approaches in terms of learning both the teammates' behavior and the environment's dynamics. In addition, the authors claim that AI can be used for learning both the teammates' behavior and the environment's dynamics.

**Results/Data**

The proposed AI framework is evaluated on a multi-agent game called "Qplex". The Qplex is an extension of the dueling game which is a 2-player zero-sum game. In this paper, the authors use the Qplex to evaluate the proposed AI. The authors also claim that the proposed AI can be used for learning both the teammates' behavior and the environment's dynamics. This is because the current MARL approaches are not robust enough in terms of learning both the teammates' behavior and the environment's dynamics. In addition, the authors claim that AI can be used for learning both the teammates' behavior and the environment's dynamics.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The proposed AI framework has some limitations. The first limitation is that the proposed AI requires a large amount of training data. This is because the current MARL approaches do not consider the uncertainty of the environment or the teammates' actions, which means that the agents need to learn their own goals and subgoals by observing the other agents' behavior. In this paper, the authors propose an online learning approach based on the idea of "thinking how your teammate thinks". This is because the current MARL approaches are not robust enough in terms of learning both the teammates' behavior and the environment's dynamics. The authors also claim that AI can be used for learning both the teammates' behavior and the environment's dynamics. In addition, the authors claim that AI can be used for learning both the teammates' behavior and the environment's dynamics. This is because the current MARL approaches are not robust enough in terms of learning both the teammates' behavior and the environment's dynamics.
