**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Factorised Active Inference for Strategic Multi-Agent Learning" by Wolfram Barfuss et al. (2022) presents a novel approach to multi-agent learning in the context of strategic games, which is an active inference perspective that can be used to learn Nash equilibria in general-sum games. The authors provide a unified framework for the study of both cooperative and competitive games. The paper's main contributions are: 1) A factorised representation of the expected free energy (EFE), which is a probabilistic model of other agents' beliefs that can be used to learn Nash equilibria in general-sum games, and 2) An application of this framework to the iterated prisoner's dilemma. The authors also discuss how their approach relates to other approaches to multi-agent learning.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The paper presents a novel approach to multi-agent learning that is based on an active inference perspective. This perspective is different from the traditional game-theoretic approach, which is based on the idea of fictitious play. In particular, the authors' approach can be used to learn Nash equilibria in general-sum games. The key finding of this paper is that a factorised representation of the EFE can be used for learning Nash equilibria in general-sum games. The authors also discuss how their approach relates to other approaches to multi-agent learning.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use an active inference perspective, which is different from the traditional game-theoretic approach that is based on fictitious play. This perspective can be used for learning Nash equilibria in general-sum games. The authors also discuss how their approach relates to other approaches to multi-agent learning.
