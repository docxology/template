**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Dependence of temperatures and kinetic freeze-out volume on the number of participant nucleons in Xe-Xe collisions at √sNN = 5.44 TeV" by S. Acharya et al. (2018) is an experimental study that investigates the dependence of the temperature and the kinetic freeze-out volume on the number of participating nucleons for a given centrality in Xe-Xe collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The authors use the ALICE detector to measure the transverse momentum distribution of charged particles, which are produced in the collision. The study is performed over a wide range of centralities and the results are compared with the predictions from the hydrodynamic model. In this work, we will summarize the main findings and contributions of the paper.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors compare the data taken at √sNN = 5.02 TeV (Pb-Pb) to the data taken at √sNN = 2.76 TeV (Au-Au). The results show that for a given centrality, the temperature and the kinetic freeze-out volume are higher in Xe-Xe than in Au-Au. This is an indication of the formation of similar systems in the most peripheral nucleus-nucleus collisions at high energy and in the most central nucleus-nucleus collisions at low energy. The authors also measure the mass dependent di erential temperature, initial temperature, kinetic freeze-out volume, and mean transverse momentum. The results show that the kinetic freeze-out temperature and the transverse flow velocity do not exhibit a mass dependent differential scenario due to the reason of methodology. The formation of similar systems is possible in the most peripheral nucleus-nucleus collisions at high energy and in the most central nucleus-nucleus collisions at low energy.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use the ALICE detector to measure the transverse momentum distribution of charged particles, which are produced in the collision. The study is performed over a wide range of centralities and the results are compared with the predictions from the hydrodynamic model. The data taken at √sNN = 5.02 TeV (Pb-Pb) to the data taken at √sNN = 2.76 TeV (Au-Au). The authors also measure the mass dependent di erential temperature, initial temperature, kinetic freeze-out volume, and mean transverse momentum.

**Results/Data**

The results show that for a given centrality, the temperature and the kinetic freeze-out volume are higher in Xe-Xe than in Au-Au. This is an indication of the formation of similar systems in the most peripheral nucleus-nucleus collisions at high energy and in the most central nucleus-nucleus collisions at low energy. The authors also measure the mass dependent di erential temperature, initial temperature, kinetic freeze-out volume, and mean transverse momentum. The results show that the kinetic freeze-out temperature and the transverse flow velocity extracted in this paper does not exhibit a mass dependent differential scenario due to the reason of methodology.

**Limitations/Discussion**

Many quantities are model or method dependent. The formation of similar system is possible in the most peripheral nucleus-nucleus collisions at high energy and in the most central nucleus-nucleus collisions at low energy. The authors also mention that the data availability is included within the article and are cited at relevant places within the text as references.
