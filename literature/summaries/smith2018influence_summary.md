**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Influence Estimation on Social Media Networks Using Causal Causal" by Smith et al. (2018) focuses on the problem of estimating the causal effect of a specific user's influence in social media networks, where the network structure is not fixed and the users' behaviors are not independent. The authors propose a new approach to this problem based on the structural causal model. In the first part of the paper, they introduce the concept of "influence" as the causal effect of a user on another user's behavior in the social media networks. They also discuss the challenges in estimating the influence and the state-of-the-art methods for solving this problem. In the second part, the authors propose an algorithm to estimate the influence based on the structural causal model. The last part is the experimental results.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of the paper are the new approach and the algorithm proposed by the authors. The key findings are that the new approach can be used for estimating the influence in social media networks, and the algorithm can be used to estimate the influence. The authors also provide some experimental results to support their claims.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors propose a new approach based on the structural causal model. In this part of the paper, the authors discuss the challenges in estimating the influence in the social media networks. They then describe the structural causal model and the algorithm for solving the problem. The authors also provide some experimental results to support their claims.

**Results/Data**

The authors use a real-world Twitter dataset to test the proposed approach. In this part of the paper, the authors discuss the experimental results. The authors compare the proposed approach with the state-of-the-art methods and show that the new approach can be used for estimating the influence in social media networks. The authors also provide some experimental results to support their claims.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors point out some limitations of the paper. They say that the proposed algorithm is not efficient, but it can be used as a starting point for further research. The authors also suggest some future work directions. The authors also discuss the challenges in estimating the influence and the state-of-the-art methods for solving this problem.
