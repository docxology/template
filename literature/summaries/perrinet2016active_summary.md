**Overview/Summary**

The paper presents a new perspective on the neural basis of active inference in the brain by linking it to the oculomotor system and eye movements. The authors propose that the process of active inference is not only a theoretical framework for understanding the brain's ability to make probabilistic inferences about the world, but also a neurophysiological process that can be observed in the brain's own activity. They argue that the neural signals that are used to infer the causes of sensory input can also be used to infer the causes of eye movements and that this is what happens when we perform an action such as following a moving target with our eyes. The authors suggest that active inference is not just a theoretical framework for understanding how the brain makes probabilistic inferences, but it is also a neurophysiological process that can be observed in the brain's own activity.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contribution of this paper is to show that the neural signals that are used to infer the causes of sensory input can also be used to infer the causes of eye movements and that this is what happens when we perform an action such as following a moving target with our eyes. The authors use the framework of active inference, which is a theoretical framework for understanding how the brain makes probabilistic inferences about the world, and apply it to the oculomotor system and eye movements. They argue that the process of active inference is not just a theoretical framework for understanding how the brain makes probabilistic inferences, but it is also a neurophysiological process that can be observed in the brain's own activity. The authors use this perspective to explain the neural basis of the ability to follow a moving target with our eyes and they suggest that the neural signals that are used to infer the causes of sensory input can also be used to infer the causes of eye movements.

**Methodology/Approach**

The paper is based on a theoretical framework, active inference. The authors use this perspective to understand how the brain makes probabilistic inferences about the world and they apply it to the oculomotor system and eye movements. They argue that the process of active inference is not just a theoretical framework for understanding how the brain makes probabilistic inferences, but it is also a neurophysiological process that can be observed in the brain's own activity.

**Results/Data**

The authors present simulations based on this perspective to show what happens when we follow a moving target with our eyes. The results of these simulations are presented graphically and they show the neural signals that are used to infer the causes of sensory input, which is also the process of following a target with our eyes. They compare the results of these simulations with the results of optimal control theory, which is another theoretical framework for understanding how we make decisions about what to do in order to achieve some goal. The authors show that the neural signals that are used to infer the causes of sensory input can also be used to infer the causes of eye movements and that this is what happens when we perform an action such as following a moving target with our eyes.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The main limitation of the paper is that it only presents simulations. The authors suggest that the neural signals that are used to make decisions about how to move our eyes can also be used to infer the causes of sensory input, but they do not provide any data or experimental results. They compare their results with optimal control theory and show that the two approaches give different results. The authors argue that this is because active inference is a neurophysiological process that can be observed in the brain's own activity, rather than just a theoretical framework for understanding how we make decisions.
