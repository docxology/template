**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Structured Active Inference" by T. St Clere Smithe is a foundational work in the field of structured active inference that provides a new perspective on how to structure and reason about complex systems, and it also provides a framework for understanding the current state-of-the-art in this area. The authors' main contributions are threefold: first, they provide an overview of the current state-of-the-art in the field of structured active inference; second, they introduce a new perspective on how to structure and reason about complex systems based on the idea that all agents in a system are part of the same system; third, they describe the logic of systems.
