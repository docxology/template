**Overview/Summary**

The paper presents a novel active learning approach for image classification called DEAL (Deep Evidential Active Learning). The authors argue that most existing methods for deep learning are based on the assumption that all training examples are equally important, and therefore, they do not consider the uncertainty of the model's predictions. In this work, the authors propose to use the evidential value of a prediction as an additional input in the selection process. This approach is called Deep Evidential Active Learning (DEAL). The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors first introduce the concept of the evidential value, which is defined as the probability that the model's prediction is correct. They argue that the evidential value is a more informative measure than the uncertainty in the model's predictions and it can be used to guide the selection process. The authors then propose an algorithm for this approach called DEAL (Deep Evidential Active Learning). The main idea of this algorithm is to use the evidential value as an additional input in the selection process. This paper also provides a theoretical analysis on the performance of the proposed algorithm.

**Methodology/Approach**

The first step in the proposed algorithm is to calculate the evidential value for each training example. The authors then propose a method for this approach called DEAL (Deep Evidential Active Learning). The main idea of this algorithm is to use the evidential value as an additional input in the selection process. This paper also provides a theoretical analysis on the performance of the proposed algorithm.
