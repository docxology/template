**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Distributed Simulation and Distributed Inference" by Jay et al. (2020) is a foundational contribution to the study of distributed simulation and inference problems in the context of k-ary distributions, where the goal is to simulate or learn an unknown distribution over a network with n nodes from a set of i.i.d. samples. The authors study two main problems: (1) distributed simulation, which asks for a protocol that allows any node to output a sample from the target distribution and (2) distributed inference, which asks for a protocol that allows any node to learn an estimate of some function of the target distribution. They show that both problems are impossible with n = O(k/ℓ), where ℓ is the number of bits of communication per player. The authors also provide protocols for k-ary distributions using n = O(√k) and n = O(k/2ℓ) players, respectively.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this paper are:

* A lower bound on the number of players required to simulate a target distribution over a network with n nodes. The authors show that it is impossible to do so using n = O(k/ℓ), where ℓ is the number of bits of communication per player, and they provide protocols for k-ary distributions using n = O(√k) and n = O(k/2ℓ) players.
* A lower bound on the number of players required to learn a target distribution over a network with n nodes. The authors show that it is impossible to do so using n = O(k/ℓ), where ℓ is the number of bits of communication per player, and they provide protocols for k-ary distributions using n = O(√k) and n = O(k/2ℓ) players.
* A protocol for distributed simulation with a constant factor in the number of players. The authors show that it is possible to do so using a constant number of players, where the number of players is independent of ℓ.

**Methodology/Approach**

The main approach taken by this paper is to use the connection between distributed simulation and distribution learning. The authors first establish the lower bound on the number of players required for distributed simulation and then extend it to the problem of distributed inference. They also provide a protocol for the case where ℓ = 1, before extending to general ℓ.

**Results/Data**

The main results are:

* A lower bound on the number of players required for distributed simulation. The authors show that it is impossible to do so using n = O(k/ℓ), where ℓ is the number of bits of communication per player.
* A protocol for distributed simulation with a constant factor in the number of players. The authors show that it is possible to do so using a constant number of players, where the number of players is independent of ℓ.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The main limitations and future work are:

* The lower bound on the number of players required for distributed simulation does not extend to the case with interactivity. The authors show that availability of such an interactivity can at most bring an exponential improvement in the number of players.
* The paper only provides protocols for k-ary distributions using n = O(√k) and n = O(k/2ℓ) players, respectively. It is unclear how to extend the proof of Lemma 4.5 to arbitrary ℓ.
* The authors do not provide a protocol with a constant factor in the number of players that uses only SMP.
