**Overview/Summary**

The free energy principle (FEP) is a widely used framework for understanding the dynamics of neural networks. It has been shown that in vitro cortical networks can be explained by this principle and its variants. The FEP assumes that the network's activity and plasticity are determined by the same cost function under uncertainty, which is the integral of the network's activity over time. In other words, the free energy is a functional that is defined as the negative logarithm of the probability of the hidden state given the observed data. This paper provides an experimental validation for this principle with in vitro networks. The authors show that the FEP can be applied to any neural network whose activity and plasticity are determined by the same cost function under uncertainty. They also demonstrate a quantitative prediction about the subsequent self-organisation (learning) of the system, which is a more delicate problem than the existence of such a mapping.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors first consider a biologically plausible cost function for neural networks that explains both neural activity and synaptic plasticity. The FEP can be applied to any neural network whose activity and plasticity are determined by the same cost function under uncertainty. They then identify a particular generative model under which the variational free energy is equivalent to the neural network cost function. In short, the virtues of reverse engineering are that: (i) when provided with empirical responses, it systematically identifies what hypothesis (i.e., generative model) the biological system employs to infer the external milieu. Moreover, (ii) it offers quantitative predictions about the subsequent self-organisation (i.e., learning) of the system that can be tested using data.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The present work has addressed the predictive validity of the FEP at the circuit level by delineating the functional specialisation and segregation in neuronal networks via free-energy minimisation. Identifying the characteristic functions of arbitrary neural networks is not straightforward. However, according to the complete class theorem, any system that minimises a cost function under uncertainty can be viewed as Bayesian inference. In light of this, the authors showed that any neural network— whose activity and plasticity minimise a common cost function— can be cast as performing (variaitional) Bayesian inference. Crucially, the existence of this equivalence enables the identiﬁcation of a natural map from neuronal activity to a unique generative model under which a biological system operates. Using this technique, the authors were able to explain empirical responses as inferring the causes of stimuli, under an implicit generative or world model. The reverse engineering approach differs conceptually by asking what Bayesian scheme could account for any given neuronal dynamics or neural network. By identifying the implicit inversion scheme— and requisite generative model— one can then lend any given network an interpretability and explainability. In the current application of this approach, the authors were able to explain empirical responses as inferring the causes of stimuli, under an explicit generative or world model. Furthermore, reverse engineering a generative model from observed responses speciﬁes a well-deﬁned synaptic plasticity rule. Using this rule, the self-organisation of in vitro networks follows a gradient descent on variational free energy under the POMDP generative model. In short, the virtues of reverse engineering are that: (i) when provided with empirical responses, it systematically identiﬁes what hypothesis (i.e., generative model) the biological system employs to infer the external milieu. Moreover, (ii) it offers quantitative predictions about the subsequent self-organisation (i.e., learning) of the system that can be tested using data. This provides a useful tool for analysing and predicting electrophysiological and behavoural responses and elucidating the underlying computational and self-organisation principle.
