**Overview/Summary**

The paper presents a novel approach to zero-shot structure learning and planning for autonomous robots. The authors introduce a new class of problems called "zero-shot" in the sense that the robot is not given any prior knowledge about the environment, including its layout or the location of obstacles. This problem is distinguished from the classical case where the robot has some prior knowledge (e.g., the map) and the "online" case where the robot can learn the structure as it moves through the environment. The authors propose a new class of algorithms that are able to solve this zero-shot problem in real time, with the goal of enabling robots to be deployed in unstructured environments without any prior knowledge about the layout or location of obstacles. They also present an experimental evaluation of their approach on a simulated warehouse and a home environment.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of the paper are:
- A new class of algorithms for zero-shot structure learning that can solve this problem in real time.
- An experimental evaluation of the proposed algorithm on a simulated warehouse and a home environment. The authors show that their approach is able to efficiently explore an unstructured environment, including when obstacles or other changes occur.
