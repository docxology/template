**Overview/Summary**

The paper proposes a new approach to arranging goods in warehouses using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and Backtracking (BA). The proposed method combines the strengths of both algorithms for managing different categories of goods with known quantities, where BA is used for organizing multiple categories. It also provides flexibility for the number and size of the goods. The method can be applied to arrange the blocks and goods in addition to the form of cubes and blocks.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The test from both scenarios shows that the proposed method has a promising result.  The test from both scenarios show that the proposed method has good level of speed and occupation, works with multiple goods' categories, and provides the flexibility for the number and size of the goods.  The arrangement of the goods with the same size and the arrangement of the goods with random sizes have a similar time process which indicates that this method can be used to arrange the goods that have the same size and different sizes.

**Methodology/Approach**

The proposed approach is based on the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm.  The ACO algorithm is inspired by the foraging behavior of real ants. It uses a set of rules called pheromone trails which are updated according to the amount of food found at each location and the distance from the nest.  In this paper, the authors use the ACO algorithm to organize a number of goods that have been known. The BA algorithm is used for managing the goods where it is possible to have different categories (however it is complex and needs a considerably long processing time).  The proposed approach can be applied in arranging the blocks and goods in addition to the form of cubes and blocks.

**Results/Data**

The test from both scenarios show that the proposed method has good level of speed and occupation, works with multiple goods' categories, and provides the flexibility for the number and size of the goods.  The arrangement of the goods with the same size and the arrangement of the goods with random sizes have a similar time process which indicates that this method can be used to arrange the goods that have the same size and different sizes.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The proposed approach has been tested and shows a promising result.   The test from both scenarios show that the proposed approach has good level of speed and occupation, works with multiple goods' categories, and provides the flexibility for the number and size of the goods.  However, the performance of this method is still limited due to the size of the tree that greatly influence the performance of search.  Its usability is also still limited only for block and goods in addition to the form of cubes and blocks.
