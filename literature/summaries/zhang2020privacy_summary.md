**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Privacy for All: Demystify Vulnerability Disparity of Differential Privacy against Membership Inference" by Tao Zhang et al. (2017) is a study on the vulnerability disparity problem in differential privacy, which is an important topic in the field of privacy-preserving machine learning. The authors show that there is no correlation between the size of unsafety and the privacy budget, and this has been demonstrated by the results in the paper. This is because the DP enforcement on the target model does not consider the protected attributes as well as the data distribution on these attributes. Therefore, the amount of vulnerability disparity is unpredictable and changes inconsistently with the increment of the privacy budget.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors show that there is no correlation between the size of unsafety and the privacy budget, and this has been demonstrated by the results in the paper. This is because the DP enforcement on the target model does not consider the protected attributes as well as the data distribution on these attributes. Therefore, the amount of vulnerability disparity is unpredictable and changes inconsistently with the increment of the privacy budget.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors show that there is no correlation between the size of unsafety and the privacy budget, and this has been demonstrated by the results in the paper. This is because the DP enforcement on the target model does not consider the protected attributes as well as the data distribution on these attributes. Therefore, the amount of vulnerability disparity is unpredictable and changes inconsistently with the increment of the privacy budget.

**Results/Data**

The authors show that there is no correlation between the size of unsafety and the privacy budget, and this has been demonstrated by the results in the paper. This is because the DP enforcement on the target model does not consider the protected attributes as well as the data distribution on these attributes. Therefore, the amount of vulnerability disparity is unpredictable and changes inconsistently with the increment of the privacy budget.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors show that there is no correlation between the size of unsafety and the privacy budget, and this has been demonstrated by the results in the paper. This is because the DP enforcement on the target model does not consider the protected attributes as well as the data distribution on these attributes.
