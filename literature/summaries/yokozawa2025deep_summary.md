=== OVERVIEW/ SUMMARY ===

Deep Active Inference with Diffusion Policy and Multiple Time Scales (MTRSS) is a novel approach that unifies exploration and goal-directed navigation in real-world robotics by minimizing the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO). The authors propose to use an MTRSS as the world model, which can provide stable long-horizon predictions. In addition, they incorporate a diffusion policy into the AIF framework, enabling the generation of diverse and context-dependent action candidates. The integration of the policy and the world models within the ELBO formulation enables the epistemic and extrinsic values to be exploited effectively, resulting in improved navigation performance compared with baseline methods.

=== KEY CONTRIBUTIONS/ FINDINGS ===

The authors' main contributions are threefold. First, they propose an MTRSS as the world model for AIF, which can reduce long-horizon prediction errors compared with RSSM. Second, they incorporate a diffusion policy into the AIF framework, enabling the generation of diverse and context-dependent action candidates. Third, they show that the integration of the policy and the world models within the ELBO formulation enables the epistemic and extrinsic values to be exploited effectively, resulting in improved navigation performance compared with baseline methods.

=== METHODOLOGY/ APPROACH ===

The authors first propose an MTRSS as the world model for AIF. The MTRSS is a variant of the Recurrent State Space Model (RSSM) that can provide stable long-horizon predictions. In addition, they incorporate a diffusion policy into the AIF framework, which enables the generation of diverse and context-dependent action candidates. The integration of the policy and the world models within the ELBO formulation enables the epistemic and extrinsic values to be exploited effectively, resulting in improved navigation performance compared with baseline methods.

=== RESULTS/ DATA ===

The authors show that the MTRSS can reduce long-horizon prediction errors compared with RSSM. The authors also demonstrate that the integration of the policy and the world models within the ELBO formulation enables the epistemic and extrinsic values to be exploited effectively, resulting in improved navigation performance compared with baseline methods.

=== LIMITATIONS/ DISCUSSION ===

The authors acknowledge three limitations. First, the experimental environment was limited to a single indoor room, which limited the diversity of the conditions tested. Second, although MTRSS reduced long-horizon prediction errors compared with RSSM, deviations such as spatial discontinuity still occurred (Fig. 6(c)). Third, the precision for the extrinsic term was heuristically scheduled as in (16) for numerical stability, limiting the theoretical completeness of the active inference formulation.
