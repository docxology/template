**Overview/Summary**
The paper "Whence the Expected Free Energy?" by Biehl et al. (2020) is a critical examination of the expected free energy (EFE), which is an objective function for active inference in partially-observed Markov decision processes (POMDPs). The authors argue that the EFE, which has been used as the objective function for active inference, is not a direct extension of the variational free energy (VFE) into the future. They then derive a novel objective called the "free energy of the expected future" (FEF), and show that it lacks the desirable epistemic value term of the EFE. Finally, they propose another objective, the "free energy of the expected future" (FEFF), which attempts to get the best of both worlds by preserving the desirable information-seeking properties of the EFE while also maintaining a mathematically principled origin.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The main contributions and findings of this paper are:
1. The authors show that the EFE is not a direct extension of the VFE into the future, but rather it can be expressed as just the FEF minus the expected information gain.
2. They derive another objective called the "free energy of the expected future" (FEFF), which attempts to get the best of both worlds by preserving the desirable information-seeking properties of the EFE while also maintaining a mathematically principled origin.

**Methodology/Approach**
The paper is based on the mathematical framework of active inference, which was originally developed in the context of continuous time. The authors use this continuous-time formulation as motivation for their discrete-time POMDPs. They then derive the EFE and FEF from it by taking the limit as the number of time steps goes to infinity. In particular, they show that the EFE can be expressed as just the FEF minus the expected information gain.

**Results/Data**
The paper shows that the EFE is not a direct extension of the VFE into the future. The authors then derive another objective called the "free energy of the expected future" (FEFF), which attempts to get the best of both worlds by preserving the desirable information-seeking properties of the EFE while also maintaining a mathematically principled origin.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The paper does not argue for the use of the FEF instead of the EFE as a direct extension of the VFE into the future. The authors do not claim that the FEF is the only, or even the natural, objective function to use. They encourage experimentation with different objectives for active inference. The logical requirements of exactly which functional (if any) is mandated by the free-energy principle remain open.
