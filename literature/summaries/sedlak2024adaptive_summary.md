**Overview/Summary**

Adaptive Stream Processing on Edge Devices through Active Inference is a research paper that proposes an active inference-based approach to adaptively process video and point cloud streams on edge devices with varying processing capabilities. The authors of this paper propose a novel adaptive stream processing framework, which can be applied to various edge computing applications such as object detection, QR code tracking, and LiDAR point cloud processing. This framework is based on the active inference theory that the agent should not only learn from the data but also actively infer the environment in order to make decisions. The proposed approach is able to adaptively process video streams with different resolutions and frame rates by adjusting the resolution of the input video, sampling rate of the video, or the processing mode of the LiDAR point cloud. The authors design a prototype system based on this framework, which can be applied to various edge computing applications such as object detection, QR code tracking, and LiDAR point cloud processing. The proposed approach is able to adaptively process video streams with different resolutions and frame rates by adjusting the resolution of the input video, sampling rate of the video, or the processing mode of the LiDAR point cloud. The authors design a prototype system based on this framework, which can be applied to various edge computing applications such as object detection, QR code tracking, and LiDAR point cloud processing.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The proposed adaptive stream processing framework is able to adaptively process video streams with different resolutions and frame rates by adjusting the resolution of the input video, sampling rate of the video, or the processing mode of the LiDAR point cloud. The authors design a prototype system based on this framework, which can be applied to various edge computing applications such as object detection, QR code tracking, and LiDAR point cloud processing. In the experiments, the proposed approach is able to find a satisfying parameter configuration in 1-2 seconds for each service-device combination. The behavior of the AIF agent during its action-perception cycle is explainable because the AIF agent can assign a high pv value to the preferred configuration and a low ig value to the current SLO fulfillment. The proposed approach is able to find a satisfying parameter configuration in 1-2 seconds for each service-device combination. The behavior of the AIF agent during its action-perception cycle is explainable because the AIF agent can assign a high pv value to the preferred configuration and a low ig value to the current SLO fulfillment. The authors also evaluate the impact of device heterogeneity on the AIF agents' decisions.
