**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Using Pseudo-Stochastic Rational Languages in Probabilistic Learning" by Amaury Habrard, François Denis, and Yann Esposito is concerned with the problem of learning a target language from a set of observations. The authors consider the case where the target language is a rational stochastic language (RSL) which is defined as the formal language 

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors first show that any RSL can be 

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors first introduce the definition of RSLs and the multiplicity automaton. The authors then show that any RSL can be 

**Results/Data**

The authors then apply their results to the case where the target language is a pseudo-stochastic RSL. They show that it is possible to learn a pseudo-stochastic RSL from a set of observations and give an algorithm for drawing a word according to the distribution of a given pseudo-stochastic RSL.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors also discuss some limitations and future work. The authors mention that the problem of learning a target language from a set of observations is still open in the case where the target language is not a pseudo-stochastic RSL. They also mention that the problem of learning a stochastic RSL from a set of observations is still open when the multiplicity automaton has more than 2n states, where n is the number of states of its minimal normal form.
