**Overview/Summary**
The paper proposes a new method for adaptive cluster thresholding with spatial activation (ACTSA) to perform image segmentation and feature extraction in the presence of noise. The authors' previous work on this topic, which is based on the conventional Otsu thresholding algorithm, has been extended by incorporating the spatial information into the clustering process. In the proposed ACTSA method, a new adaptive cluster thresholding with spatial activation (ACTSA) is used to adjust the threshold value of each pixel in the image. The authors' previous work on this topic, which is based on the conventional Otsu thresholding algorithm, has been extended by incorporating the spatial information into the clustering process. In the proposed ACTSA method, a new adaptive cluster thresholding with spatial activation (ACTSA) is used to adjust the threshold value of each pixel in the image.
