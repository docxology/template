**Overview/Summary**
The paper presents a three-dimensional (3D) assessment of susceptibility-induced artifacts in cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) caused by the presence of active cardiac implants. The authors investigate the influence of the implant type and orientation on the size of the signal voids, which are a common problem when using 2D or 3D T1-weighted sequences with long echo times. In a phantom study, the signal voids were measured in three different orientations (0°, 90°, and 180°) for four different types of cardiac devices: pacemakers, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs), implantable loop recorders (ILRs), and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator with a lead. The authors use two different sequences to acquire the data: a 2D turbo-spin-echo (TSE) sequence and a 3D T1-weighted gradient-echo sequence. The first sequence is sensitive to the B0 field inhomogeneity, while the second one is not. The signal voids were measured as the difference between the reference image without an implant and the image with the cardiac device present. The results show that the size of the signal voids depends on the type of the device and its orientation. The authors also compare the 2D-TSE sequence to the 3D T1-weighted gradient-echo sequence in terms of the size of the artifacts. The study demonstrates a new approach for artifact reduction in CMR.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The main finding is that the signal voids are device-dependent and orientation-dependent, and they can be reduced by using the 3D T1-weighted gradient-echo sequence instead of the 2D-TSE sequence. The study also shows a new approach for artifact reduction in CMR.

**Methodology/Approach**
The authors use a phantom with a cylindrical shape to measure the signal voids. The phantom is made of a mixture of water and agarose, which has a susceptibility similar to that of human tissue. The four different types of cardiac devices are placed inside the phantom: pacemakers, ICDs, ILRs, and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator with a lead. Three different orientations (0°, 90°, and 180°) are used for each device type. The authors use two different sequences to acquire the data: a 2D TSE sequence and a 3D T1-weighted gradient-echo sequence. The first sequence is sensitive to the B0 field inhomogeneity, while the second one is not. The signal voids were measured as the difference between the reference image without an implant and the image with the cardiac device present. The results show that the size of the signal voids depends on the type of the device and its orientation.

**Results/Data**
The authors use a 2D TSE sequence and a 3D T1-weighted gradient-echo sequence to acquire the data. The first sequence is sensitive to the B0 field inhomogeneity, while the second one is not. The signal voids were measured as the difference between the reference image without an implant and the image with the cardiac device present. The results show that the size of the signal voids depends on the type of the device and its orientation.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The study demonstrates a new approach for artifact reduction in CMR. However, there are some limitations to this method. The 3D T1-weighted gradient-echo sequence is not suitable for all types of artifacts, such as those caused by the B0 field inhomogeneity or the phase shift. The authors also compare the 2D-TSE sequence with the 3D T1-weighted gradient-echo sequence in terms of the size of the artifacts. The study shows that the 3D T1-weighted gradient-echo sequence is not suitable for all types of artifacts, and it may be used to reduce some specific type of artifact.

**Supplemental File**
The supplemental file contains two figures: a gray profile for a specific location and three sets of 2D-TSE and 3D-TEF induced signal void volumes and bounding boxes for the four devices measured in three orientations.

The second one shows that the size of the signal voids depends on the type of the device and its orientation, but it does not depend on the sequence used to acquire the data.
