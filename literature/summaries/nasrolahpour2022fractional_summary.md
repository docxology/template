**Overview/Summary**
The paper "Fractional Electromagnetic Field Theory and Its Applications" by [Author Names] is a comprehensive review of recent advancements in the field of fractional electromagnetic theory (FET). The authors present an extensive overview of the fundamental concepts, mathematical tools, and applications of FET. They also discuss its connections with other areas of physics, such as quantum mechanics, relativity, and statistical physics.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The main contributions of this paper are to provide a unified framework for the study of the electromagnetic field theory in fractional space-time and its application in various fields. The authors present the basic concepts of FET, including the fractional Maxwell equations, the fractional Lorentz force, and the fractional energy-momentum tensor. They also discuss the different types of the fractional time derivatives that are used to describe the physical phenomena with a non-integer time order. The paper is organized as follows: First, the authors present the basic concepts of FET in the first section. In this section, they introduce the Riemann-Liouville (RL) and Caputo-Glasser (CG) fractional derivatives that are used to describe the physical phenomena with a non-integer time order. The second section is devoted to the fundamental concepts of FET. The authors present the Maxwell equations in the RL and CG forms, the Lorentz force, and the energy-momentum tensor. The third section is focused on the different types of the fractional time derivatives that are used to describe the physical phenomena with a non-integer time order. In this section, they discuss the properties of the RL and CG fractional derivatives in detail. They also present some applications of FET in various fields such as quantum mechanics, relativity, and statistical physics.

**Methodology/Approach**
The authors use the Riemann-Liouville (RL) and Caputo-Glasser (CG) fractional derivatives to describe the physical phenomena with a non-integer time order. The RL derivative is defined by

$$D_t^{\alpha}f(t)=\frac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha)}\int_0^t \frac{f(\tau)}{(t-\tau)^{1+\alpha}}d\tau, \quad 0<\alpha <1.$$

The CG derivative is defined by

$$D_t^{\alpha}f(t)=\frac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha)}\int_0^t f(\tau)\left[\frac{1}{(t-\tau)^{\alpha}}+\frac{\alpha}{\Gamma(\alpha)}\right]d\tau, \quad 0<\alpha <1.$$

The authors use the RL and CG derivatives to describe the physical phenomena with a non-integer time order. The RL derivative is used in the first section of the paper where the fundamental concepts of FET are introduced. In this section, the authors present the Maxwell equations in the RL and CG forms, the Lorentz force, and the energy-momentum tensor. The third section of the paper is focused on the different types of the fractional time derivatives that are used to describe the physical phenomena with a non-integer time order. In this section, the authors discuss the properties of the RL and CG fractional derivatives in detail. They also present some applications of FET in various fields such as quantum mechanics, relativity, and statistical physics.

**Results/Data**
The main results of the paper are presented in the first three sections. The authors introduce the basic concepts of FET in the first section. In this section, they discuss the Maxwell equations in the RL and CG forms, the Lorentz force, and the energy-momentum tensor. They also present some applications of FET in various fields such as quantum mechanics, relativity, and statistical physics.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The authors conclude that the fractional time derivatives are used to describe the physical phenomena with a non-integer time order. The authors mention that the RL derivative is more suitable for the description of the causal systems than the CG one. They also mention that the CG derivative is more convenient in the study of the systems with memory. The authors suggest that the FET can be applied in various fields such as quantum mechanics, relativity, and statistical physics.
