**Overview/Summary**

The paper discusses the application of active inference (AIF) in a distributed computing environment, where each service is associated with an autonomous AIF agent that makes decisions to optimize its own performance while fulfilling its SLOiDs. The authors describe how the use case for this research was developed and the main challenges faced when integrating AIF into the context of the Computing Continuum (CC), which is a complex system that can be understood as a distributed computing environment. They present the tools and simulation setup used to conduct the experiments, including the AIF library pymdp, the dataset, and the key elements of the simulation process. The paper also describes how the performance of the active inference agents was evaluated in the context of the CC.

**Results/Data**

The authors use the dataset to simulate different operational scenarios for the pipeline, helping to validate the performance of the active inference agents under varying conditions. Since the dataset missed few combinations of resolution and FPS, some missing FPS values were approximated. Specifically, the missing FPS values were interpolated by averaging the neighboring values. The standard deviation of these neighboring values was also considered to ensure a realistic approximation of the missing data.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors note that the version of pymdp used for this work was based on a customized fork from GitHub, which is specifically adapted to handle the types of complex state transitions encountered in this use case. The authors also mention that the dataset was
