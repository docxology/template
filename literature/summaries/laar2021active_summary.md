**Overview/Summary**
The paper presents a new theoretical framework for understanding the interplay between active inference and epistemic value in the context of graphical models. In particular, the authors show that the (constrained) Bethe free energy (CBFE) is an extrinsically driven objective when the external reward is available but not when it is not. The paper also introduces a new decomposition of the CBFE into three components: conﬁdence, complexity and extrinsic value. This decomposition provides a way to understand the interplay between these three quantities in the context of the Bethe free energy.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The main contributions of this work are the following:
- The authors show that the CBFE is an extrinsically driven objective when the external reward is available but not when it is not. This is a key insight that has been missing from the literature, and the paper demonstrates how to understand the interplay between these two quantities in the context of the Bethe free energy.
- The authors introduce a new decomposition of the CBFE into three components: conﬁdence, complexity and extrinsic value. This decomposition provides a way to understand the interplay between these three quantities in the context of the Bethe free energy.

**Methodology/Approach**
The paper is based on the (constrained) Bethe free energy (CBFE). The CBFE is an approximate solution for the partition function, and it has been used as a variational approximation to the true free energy. The authors use the CBFE in their analysis of the interplay between active inference and epistemic value.

**Results/Data**
The paper presents the results from the application of the (constrained) Bethe free energy (CBFE) to the T-maze problem. The main results are the following:
- The conﬁdence, complexity and extrinsic value contributions to the CBFE for all possible policies in the T-maze problem under varying parameter settings.
- The authors show that the CBFE is an extrinsically driven objective when the external reward is available but not when it is not. This is a key insight that has been missing from the literature, and the paper demonstrates how to understand the interplay between these two quantities in the context of the Bethe free energy.
- The authors introduce a new decomposition of the CBFE into three components: conﬁdence, complexity and extrinsic value. This decomposition provides a way to understand the interplay between these three quantities in the context of the Bethe free energy.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The paper does not discuss any limitations or future work.
