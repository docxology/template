**Overview/Summary**
The paper presents a novel deep learning model for goal-directed behavior in complex environments. The authors propose a dynamic hybrid model that can infer and plan in a dynamic environment by exchanging the prediction errors between different levels of the hierarchy, which is different from the previous static models. This dynamic model is composed of multiple layers with different types of nodes: the high-level discrete model, the low-level continuous generative model, and the virtual level for the tool configuration. The paper first discusses the key features that a deep hybrid model should have to efficiently solve complex tasks in a dynamic environment, such as decomposing the task into subgoals, maintaining distinct beliefs about different entities, and representing the self with a hierarchical structure. Then, it presents a specific application of the proposed model for tool use, which requires planning in a dynamic context and coordination of all elements of the agent's body. The paper shows that the proposed model can be used efficiently in this task by decomposing the task into subgoals, inferring distinct beliefs about the self and every entity, and specifying goals at different levels of the hierarchy.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The authors show that the proposed dynamic hybrid model can be used efficiently to solve a complex task. The key findings are as follows: 1) the proposed model can decompose the task into subgoals; 2) the agent can maintain distinct beliefs about its arm, the tool, and the object, all of which must be inferred from sensory observations if their locations are unknown or constantly changing; 3) the agent should represent the self with a hierarchical structure; 4) the proposed model can be used efficiently in this task by decomposing the task into subgoals, inferring distinct beliefs about the self and every entity, and specifying goals at different levels of the hierarchy. The authors also analyze the performance of the proposed model and describe the effects of dynamic planning in terms of accumulated sensory evidence and transitions over discrete hidden states.

The paper first discusses the key features that a deep hybrid model should have to efficiently solve complex tasks in a dynamic environment, such as decomposing the task into subgoals, maintaining distinct beliefs about different entities, and representing the self with a hierarchical structure. Then, it presents a specific application of the proposed model for tool use, which requires planning in a dynamic context and coordination of all elements of the agent's body.

The authors also analyze the performance of the proposed model and describe the effects of dynamic planning in terms of accumulated sensory evidence and transitions over discrete hidden states.

**Results/Data**
The paper presents a specific application of the proposed model for tool use, which requires planning in a dynamic context and coordination of all elements of the agent's body. The authors show that the proposed model can be used efficiently in this task by decomposing the task into subgoals; 2) the agent can maintain distinct beliefs about its arm, the tool, and the object, all of which must be inferred from sensory observations if their locations are unknown or constantly changing; 3) the agent should represent the self with a hierarchical structure; 4) the proposed model can be used efficiently in this task by decomposing the task into subgoals, inferring distinct beliefs about the self and every entity, and specifying goals at different levels of the hierarchy. The authors also analyze the performance of the proposed model and describe the effects of dynamic planning in terms of accumulated sensory evidence and transitions over discrete hidden states.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The paper discusses the limitations and future work of the proposed method as follows: 1) the proposed model is not directly applicable to other complex tasks; 2) the authors do not discuss how the virtual level can be applied in general. The authors also mention that the proposed model can be used for other complex tasks, such as reaching an object with a tool and grasping multiple objects.
