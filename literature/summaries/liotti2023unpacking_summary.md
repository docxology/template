**Overview/Summary**

The present study is an attempt to investigate the relationship between epistemic trust and borderline personality disorder (BPD) in a sample of adolescent inpatients. The authors are well-known for their work on mentalizing, which refers to the ability to understand others' mental states as if they were our own. It has been shown that people with BPD have difficulties in this area, but it is not clear whether these difficulties are related to borderline pathology or the disorder itself. This paper is an attempt to investigate this question.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors first present a theoretical model of how mentalizing and epistemic trust work together in the therapeutic relationship. They then describe their clinical illustrations, which are based on two cases that were treated by the same therapist using the same treatment. The first case is an adult with BPD who has been followed up for 15 years after the original treatment. The second case is a young person with BPD who was treated as an adolescent inpatient. The authors suggest that borderline pathology and epistemic trust are related, but they also note that there may be other factors at play.

**Methodology/Approach**

The first case is based on 15 years of follow-up after the original treatment. The second case is a clinical illustration. The authors describe the two cases in detail to illustrate how borderline pathology and epistemic trust are related, but they also note that there may be other factors at play.

**Results/Data**

In the first case, the patient had BPD as an adolescent inpatient and was treated by the same therapist using the same treatment. The second case is a clinical illustration based on this same therapist's work with the same treatment. The authors describe these two cases to illustrate how borderline pathology and epistemic trust are related, but they also note that there may be other factors at play.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The study has some limitations. The first limitation is that it is a single case study. The second limitation is the small sample size of the adolescent inpatient with BPD. The authors suggest that borderline pathology and epistemic trust are related, but they also note that there may be other factors at play.
