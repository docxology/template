**Overview/Summary**

The paper presents a comprehensive study on the performance of quantum computers before fault tolerance is achieved. The authors investigate the error thresholds for various quantum computing tasks in the presence of noise and compare them to the noise thresholds for the same tasks, which are the minimum amount of noise required to cause the correct result to be wrong with high probability. They find that the two thresholds are similar for most of the tasks considered. This is important because it means that the noise level can be used as a proxy for the error threshold in practice. The paper also shows the noise thresholds for the same tasks, which are the minimum amount of noise required to cause the correct result to be wrong with high probability.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors find that the two thresholds are similar for most of the tasks considered. This is important because it means that the noise level can be used as a proxy for the error threshold in practice. The paper also shows the noise thresholds for the same tasks, which are the minimum amount of noise required to cause the correct result to be wrong with high probability.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use a quantum circuit simulator called Qiskit to generate many random circuits and measure their performance by running them on a noisy simulator. The paper also uses a set of 3-bit Clifford gates, which are the most basic building blocks for any quantum circuit. They consider three types of noise: bit flip, phase flip, and depolarizing. For each type of noise, they generate many random circuits and measure their performance by running them on a noisy simulator. The authors also use a set of 3-bit Clifford gates to generate the random circuits.

**Results/Data**

The authors find that the two thresholds are similar for most of the tasks considered. This is important because it means that the noise level can be used as a proxy for the error threshold in practice. The paper also shows the noise thresholds for the same tasks, which are the minimum amount of noise required to cause the correct result to be wrong with high probability.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors do not discuss any limitations or future work.
