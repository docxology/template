**Overview/Summary**
Predictive coding under the free-energy principle is a research paper in the field of neuroscience and psychology. The authors propose that the brain's function can be understood by considering it to be an inference machine that tries to minimize its own "free energy" (a measure of the amount of information it has about itself). This is similar to how a computer program, or any other system, works: it takes in sensory input and produces an output. The difference between the two is the "information" which is then used by the brain to make decisions. The authors also propose that this process can be understood as a form of learning.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The main result of the paper is the development of a theory for how the brain's function can be understood in terms of predictive coding, and how it can be applied to understand the brain. In particular, the authors show that the free energy principle (a mathematical formula) provides a way to understand the brain as an inference machine. The authors also provide some examples of how this framework can be used to explain many different phenomena in the brain.

**Methodology/Approach**
The approach is based on the idea that the brain's function can be understood by considering it to be an inference machine, and that the free energy principle (a mathematical formula) provides a way to understand the brain as an inference machine. The authors also provide some examples of how this framework can be used to explain many different phenomena in the brain.

**Results/Data**
The main results of the paper are the development of a theory for how the brain's function can be understood in terms of predictive coding, and how it can be applied to understand the brain. In particular, the authors show that the free energy principle (a mathematical formula) provides a way to understand the brain as an inference machine. The authors also provide some examples of how this framework can be used to explain many different phenomena in the brain.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The main weakness of the paper is that it does not give enough detail about the free energy principle, and why the authors believe that it should be applied to the brain. This is a mathematical formula which is well established in other fields (such as physics), but the authors do not explain how this formula can be used to understand the brain. The main strength of the paper is its ability to provide an overall framework for understanding the brain, and many different phenomena in the brain.
