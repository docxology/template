**Overview/Summary**

The paper proposes a new approach to conditional inference in the context of ACT-R (Anderson's 1983) production system model that is based on the spreading activation theory. The authors argue that the current approaches for focused and non-focused inference are not sufficient because they do not take into account the knowledge entities' base-levels, which are the basic building blocks of the knowledge in a human mind. The paper also proposes an approach to conditional reasoning with activation of these knowledge entities based on the spreading activation theory. The authors claim that this new approach can implement several aspects of human reasoning such as focusing, forgetting and remembering.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contribution of the paper is the development of a typical model for activation-based conditional inference. This model is applied to ACT-R (Anderson's 1983) production system model and the authors claim that this new approach can implement several aspects of human reasoning into modern expert systems such as focusing, forgetting and remembering.

**Methodology/Approach**

The paper proposes an activation function from ACT-R for conditionals and selects the conditionals with the highest degree of activation for focused inference. The authors also propose a method to select the conditionals that are most likely to be selected by a selection s if the spreading activation is high enough to compensate the low base-level activation, which can implement forgetting and remembering.

**Results/Data**

The paper proposes an approach to conditional reasoning with activation of these knowledge entities based on the spreading activation theory. The authors claim that this new approach can implement several aspects of human reasoning into modern expert systems such as focusing, forgetting and remembering. In particular, the authors compare the results of focused and non-focused inference in ACT-R with the use of the proposed activation function from ACT-R for conditionals and select the conditionals with the highest degree of activation for focused inference. The authors also compare the results of these two approaches with the use of the proposed activation function from ACT-R for conditionals and a selection s if the spreading activation is high enough to compensate the low base-level activation, which can implement forgetting and remembering.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The main challenge for future work is to find for a given query q and an inference operator I a proper least subset ∆ of a belief base ∆ such that the query is answered the same wrt. ∆ as to ∆, without having to draw the computationally expensive inference [  [q]  ]I∆.
