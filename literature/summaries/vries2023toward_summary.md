**Overview/Summary**
The paper "Toward Design of Synthetic Active Inference Agents by NUV-EM" presents a new approach to design synthetic active inference agents (SAIAs) for the automated design of Bayesian signal processing algorithms, which can be used as a building block in the ecosystem of intelligence from first principles. The authors propose a novel variational message passing (VMP) algorithm that is based on the NUV-EM (non-uniformly weighted vector expectation maximization) approach and the outcome-blind certainty seeker (OBCS). In this paper, the authors show how to use VMP for the automated design of SAIA. The main contributions are the development of a new variational message passing algorithm that is based on NUV-EM and OBCS, and the demonstration of its application in the automated design of SAIA.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The key findings of this paper are the development of the VMP algorithm and the use of the VMP for the automated design of SAIA. The authors show that the VMP can be used to solve the problem of the distribution mismatch between the variational lower bound (VLB) and the true posterior in the OBCS, which is a common issue in the existing active inference algorithms. In this paper, the authors also demonstrate how to use the VMP for the automated design of SAIA. The main results are that the VMP can be used to solve the problem of the distribution mismatch between the VLB and the true posterior in the OBCS, and the VMP is a powerful tool for the automated design of SAIA.

**Methodology/Approach**
The authors first present the existing active inference algorithms based on the variational lower bound (VLB) and the outcome-blind certainty seeker (OBCS). The authors then propose a new VMP algorithm that is based on NUV-EM. The main idea of the VMP is to use the NUV-EM for the variational message passing, which can be used to solve the problem of the distribution mismatch between the VLB and the true posterior in the OBCS. In this paper, the authors also present a new approach to design SAIA by using the VMP.

**Results/Data**
The main results of this paper are the application of the VMP for the automated design of SAIA. The authors show that the VMP can be used to solve the problem of the distribution mismatch between the VLB and the true posterior in the OBCS, and the VMP is a powerful tool for the automated design of SAIA.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The main weakness of this paper is that it does not discuss the comparison with existing active inference algorithms. The authors also do not discuss the future work on how to use the VMP for the automated design of other Bayesian signal processing algorithms. The authors only present a new approach to solve the problem of the distribution mismatch between the VLB and the true posterior in the OBCS, but it is not clear whether this method can be used to solve the problem of the distribution mismatch between the VLB and the true posterior in the existing active inference algorithms. The paper does not discuss how to use the VMP for the automated design of other Bayesian signal processing algorithms.
