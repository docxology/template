**Overview/Summary**

The paper proposes a novel active inference reinforcement learning (AIRL) approach for robotic manipulation tasks. The authors argue that current deep reinforcement learning methods are not suitable for complex manipulation tasks because they do not take into account the physical properties of the environment and the robot, which makes them less interpretable and less effective. In contrast, AIRL is a model-based method that can be used to learn both the internal dynamics of the environment and the external dynamics of the agent (robot) in an end-to-end manner. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on several robotic manipulation tasks.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this paper are threefold: 1) it proposes a novel AIRL framework that can be used to learn both the internal and external dynamics of the environment, 2) it uses an active inference based method for learning the internal dynamics of the environment, and 3) it learns the external dynamics of the agent by using a self-supervised approach. The authors show that their proposed AIRL is more effective than current deep reinforcement learning methods.

**Methodology/Approach**

The paper first discusses the limitations of current deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches for robotic manipulation tasks, and then proposes an active inference based method to learn the internal dynamics of the environment. This involves a self-supervised approach that can be used to learn the external dynamics of the agent. The authors also compare their proposed AIRL with DRL methods in several different scenarios.

**Results/Data**

The paper shows that the proposed AIRL is more effective than current DRL approaches on several robotic manipulation tasks. It uses an active inference based method for learning the internal dynamics of the environment, and it learns the external dynamics of the agent by using a self-supervised approach. The authors also compare their proposed AIRL with DRL methods in several different scenarios.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The paper discusses the limitations of current DRL approaches and the future work. The authors argue that the proposed AIRL is more effective than current DRL approaches on several robotic manipulation tasks, but it may not be suitable for all situations. It also shows that the proposed AIRL can be used to learn both the internal and external dynamics of the environment in an end-to-end manner.
