**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Reframing the Expected Free Energy: Four Formulations" by Thomas Parr and Karl Friston is a comprehensive overview of the free energy principle in the context of deep learning. The authors present four different formulations of the expected free energy, which are all equivalent to each other but have different mathematical forms. This equivalence is not immediately apparent from the standard presentation of the free energy principle as it has been presented in the literature so far. The paper also provides a detailed analysis of the duality between the variational and message passing approaches to the free energy principle.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this work are four equivalent formulations of the expected free energy, which are all based on the same underlying mathematical structure. This is important for several reasons. First, it provides a deeper understanding of the mathematical foundations of the free energy principle and its relation to other approaches in the literature. Second, it allows the use of different formulations depending on the context or application. Third, it gives a clear basis for comparing the variational and message passing approaches. The paper also highlights the importance of the duality between these two approaches.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors begin by presenting the standard formulation of the free energy principle in the context of deep learning. This is based on the idea that the expected free energy, which is a function of the parameters and data, can be used to select the best model from a set of models. The paper then presents four different formulations of this function. These are all based on the same underlying mathematical structure, but they have different mathematical forms. This is not immediately apparent from the standard presentation of the free energy principle as it has been presented in the literature so far. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the duality between the variational and message passing approaches to the free energy principle.

**Results/Data**

The main results of this work are four equivalent formulations of the expected free energy, which are all based on the same underlying mathematical structure. This is important for several reasons. First, it provides a deeper understanding of the mathematical foundations of the free energy principle and its relation to other approaches in the literature. Second, it allows the use of different formulations depending on the context or application. Third, it gives a clear basis for comparing the variational and message passing approaches.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The main limitation of this work is that the authors do not present any new results. The paper does not provide any new insights into the free energy principle. It only provides an analysis of the existing literature. This is important in its own right, but it may be less valuable than a work which presents new contributions.
