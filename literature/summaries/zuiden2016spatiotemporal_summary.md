**Overview/Summary**
The paper investigates the spatiotemporal order of a two-dimensional (2D) active nematic liquid crystal in the presence of an edge. The authors demonstrate that the 2D nematic liquid crystal can exhibit a novel type of pattern, which is different from the well-known target-pattern and defect-mediated patterns. This new type of pattern is called "emergent edge" and it is characterized by the fact that the director field in the bulk is parallel to the edge. The authors also show that this emergent edge is not a simple boundary but has a finite width, which can be much larger than the target-pattern width. In addition, the authors find that the emergent edge is stable for a wide range of parameters and it is robust against the defects in the initial condition.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The main findings of this paper are the following:
1. The authors show that the 2D nematic liquid crystal can exhibit an emergent edge, which is different from the well-known target-pattern and defect-mediated patterns.
2. They demonstrate that the emergent edge has a finite width, which can be much larger than the target-pattern width.
3. The authors find that the emergent edge is stable for a wide range of parameters and it is robust against the defects in the initial condition.

**Methodology/Approach**
The authors use the 2D nematic liquid crystal as their model system. They perform numerical simulations to study this problem. In the numerical simulation, the authors introduce an external force which can be used to control the width of the emergent edge. The authors also analyze the stability of the emergent edge in the presence of defects.

**Results/Data**
The main results of this paper are the following:
1. The authors show that the 2D nematic liquid crystal can exhibit an emergent edge, which is different from the well-known target-pattern and defect-mediated patterns.
2. They demonstrate that the emergent edge has a finite width, which can be much larger than the target-pattern width.
3. The authors find that the emergent edge is stable for a wide range of parameters and it is robust against the defects in the initial condition.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The main limitations of this paper are the following:
1. The authors do not discuss the physical mechanism of the emergent edge. This is because the 2D nematic liquid crystal is a complex system and the authors have to use numerical simulation to study it.
2. The authors do not compare their results with other theoretical or experimental works.
