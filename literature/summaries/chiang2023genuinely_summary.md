**Summary**

The paper "Genuinely Robust Inference for Clustered Data" by Kojevnikov and Song (2023) provides a novel approach to the problem of inference in regression models with unignorable cluster effects, where the conventional normal approximation fails. The main contribution is a new test statistic that can be used for testing hypotheses about the population mean of the dependent variable. The authors show that the conventional CR standard error estimator without imposing any null hypothesis is not consistent and remains random asymptotically. In contrast, the proposed test statistic with the estimated residuals has an asymptotic distribution that does not depend on the cluster effects. The paper also provides a new procedure for constructing confidence intervals. The authors' approach relies on the representation of the sample mean as a sum of two independent components: the first one is a scaled score of the largest cluster and the second one is the average of the remaining clusters. They show that the distribution of the first component is unignorable, while the distribution of the second one can be approximated by a normal distribution under some conditions. The authors' procedure for constructing confidence intervals is based on this representation and the fact that the second component has an asymptotically ignorable influence in the test statistic. The new approach is valid even when the distribution of the first component does not follow the power law, which is the case when the error and regressor distributions are uniformly bounded. The authors' results provide a theoretical justification for the conventional CR inference procedure based on the normal approximation that has been used in many papers.

**Overview**

The paper provides a new approach to the problem of inference in regression models with unignorable cluster effects, where the conventional normal approximation fails. In particular, it shows that the conventional CR standard error estimator without imposing any null hypothesis is not consistent and remains random asymptotically. The authors' procedure for constructing confidence intervals is based on this representation and the fact that the second component has an asymptotically ignorable influence in the test statistic. The new approach is valid even when the distribution of the first component does not follow the power law, which is the case when the error and regressor distributions are uniformly bounded.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use the representation of the sample mean as a sum of two independent components: the first one is a scaled score of the largest cluster and the second one is the average of the remaining clusters. They show that the distribution of the first component is unignorable, while the distribution of the second one can be approximated by a normal distribution under some conditions.

The authors' approach relies on the fact that the first component has an unignorable influence, while the second one can be approximated by a normal distribution.

**Results/Data**

The paper shows that the conventional CR standard error estimator without imposing any null hypothesis is not consistent and remains random asymptotically. In contrast, the proposed test statistic with the estimated residuals has an asymptotic distribution that does not depend on the cluster effects. The authors also provide a new procedure for constructing confidence intervals. The authors' approach relies on this representation and the fact that the second component has an asymptotically ignorable influence in the test statistic. The authors' results provide a theoretical justification for the conventional CR inference procedure based on the normal approximation that has been used in many papers.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The paper does not discuss the computational complexity of the proposed approach or any potential issues with the implementation. It also does not mention how to deal with the case where the first component is unignorable and the second one is non-normal. The authors' results provide a theoretical justification for the conventional CR inference procedure based on the normal approximation that has been used in many papers.
