**Overview/Summary**

The paper presents a novel approach to implicit coordination in multi-agent systems. The authors propose an active epistemic inference (AEI) framework that enables agents to reason about the other agents' knowledge and beliefs, and use this reasoning for their own decision-making. In particular, they show how AEI can be used to improve the performance of a team of robots when performing tasks in an environment with obstacles. The authors formulate the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) where the state is the robot's knowledge about the other agents' beliefs and the action is the agent's belief update, which is represented by a probability distribution over the set of possible actions.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this paper are twofold. First, it presents an active epistemic inference (AEI) framework that enables agents to reason about the other agents' knowledge and beliefs, and use this reasoning for their own decision-making. Second, it shows how AEI can be used to improve the performance of a team of robots when performing tasks in an environment with obstacles.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors formulate the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) where the state is the robot's knowledge about the other agents' beliefs and the action is the agent's belief update, which is represented by a probability distribution over the set of possible actions. The POMDP is solved using an approximation algorithm that can be implemented in real time. The authors also show how to apply this framework to multi-robot systems with different types of sensors.

**Results/Data**

The results are presented as a comparison between zero-order, first-order and higher-order reasoning. The paper shows the performance of these three approaches for rendezvous, task allocation and multi-robot multi-task assignment problems in an environment with obstacles. The authors show that higher-order reasoning improves the success rate and that this improvement is more significant when the number of robots increases.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The main limitations of the paper are the following. First, the proposed AEI framework can only be used to solve POMDPs. Second, the performance of the proposed algorithm depends on the quality of the approximation algorithm. Third, the authors do not discuss how to apply this framework in other types of multi-agent systems.
