**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Models of Animal Behavior as Active Particle Systems with Non-Linear Interactions" by T. Vicsek and A. Zafeiris presents a new framework for understanding the behavior of animal groups. The authors consider a system where each individual is represented by an active particle that interacts with other particles according to its own internal state, which can be either "active" or "passive". This paper focuses on the case when the internal state of one particle depends only on the number of neighbors it has in a given time window. The authors show that such a system is equivalent to a model where each individual is represented by an active particle with non-linear interactions, and they discuss the properties of this new type of self-propelled particles. They also study the case when the internal state of one particle depends on both the number of neighbors it has in a given time window and its own state at the previous time step.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors show that if all individuals are active, then the system is equivalent to the standard self-propelled particles with non-linear interactions. The two main types of behavior for this type of systems are: (i) the "flocking" regime where the average velocity of the group is zero and the direction of motion is random; (ii) the "running" regime where the average velocity is positive and the direction is correlated with the inter-particle distance. The authors also discuss the case when all individuals are passive, and they show that in this case the system is equivalent to a model where each individual is represented by an active particle with linear interactions. In this case the two main types of behavior for the particles are: (i) "freezing" where the average velocity is zero and the direction of motion is random; (ii) "running" where the average velocity is positive and the direction is correlated with the inter-particle distance.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use a simple model to describe the behavior of animal groups. The model is based on the following assumptions: (i) each individual is represented by an active particle; (ii) the internal state of one particle depends only on the number of neighbors it has in a given time window; (iii) the internal state of one particle can be either "active" or "passive". The authors show that if all individuals are active, then the system is equivalent to the standard self-propelled particles with non-linear interactions. They also study the case when all individuals are passive, and they show that in this case the system is equivalent to a model where each individual is represented by an active particle with linear interactions.

**Results/Data**

The authors present the following results: (i) If all individuals are active, then the system is equivalent to the standard self-propelled particles with non-linear interactions. The two main types of behavior for this type of systems are: (i) the "flocking" regime where the average velocity of the group is zero and the direction of motion is random; (ii) the "running" regime where the average velocity is positive and the direction is correlated with the inter-particle distance. The authors also discuss the case when all individuals are passive, and they show that in this case the system is equivalent to a model where each individual is represented by an active particle with linear interactions. In this case the two main types of behavior for the particles are: (i) "freezing" where the average velocity is zero and the direction of motion is random; (ii) "running" where the average velocity is positive and the direction is correlated with the inter-particle distance.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors discuss the following limitations and future work. The first one is that they do not consider the case when the internal state depends on both the number of neighbors and its own state at a previous time step, which was studied in their previous paper (Vicsek et al., 2014). The second one is that the authors do not study the case where the internal state can be either "active" or "passive", but it has to be the same for all individuals. They also mention that the model they use does not take into account the time dependence of the interactions and the fact that the actual animal behavior may depend on the number of neighbors in a given time window, as well as on the previous state of the individual.
