**Overview/Summary**

The paper presents a new description of transverse momentum spectra (TMS) for identified hadrons in high-energy collisions using the Tsallis distribution function. The TMS is an important observable to understand the properties of the produced partons and the dynamics of the collision process, which can be used to test the statistical model. In this paper, the authors fit the TMS of various particles with different parameters in Eqs 8) and (10). The results show that the values of effective temperature T for the emissions of different hadrons do not depend on the collision energy. This situation is diﬀerent for the emissions of photons and leptons, in which there is a clear dependence on energy. This reﬂects that the emission processes of photons and leptons are more complex than those of hadrons. In central (pseudo)rapidity region, T shows an incremental tendency with the increase of particle or quark mass. This is understandable that more collision energies are deposited to produce massive hadrons or to drive massive quarks to take part in the process of photon and lepton production. In the forward/backward (pseudo)rapidity region, T is expected to be less than that in central (pseudo)rapidity region due to less energy deposited. The values of power index n are very large with small ﬂuctuations in this study. In the Tsallis statistics [6, 7, 8, 9, 16], n = 1 / (q − 1), where q is an entropy index that characterizes the degree of equilibrium or non-equilibrium. Generally, q = 1 corresponds to an equilibrium state. A larger q than 1 corresponds to a non-equilibrium state. This study renders that the values of q are very close to 1, which means that the collision system considered by us is approximately in an equilibrium state.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main results of this paper are the TMS for various particles with different parameters in Eqs (8) and (10). The authors ﬁt the pion spectra with diﬀerent parameters in Figs 7(a), b, c), d, e, f, g, and h. From the upper panel [Figs 7(a), b, and c)] to the middle panel [Figs 7(d), e, and f], T changes from 0.1 GeV to 0.15 GeV and then to 0.2 GeV. From the left panel to the middle panel and then to the right panel, n changes from 5 to 10 and then to 15. In each panel, the solid, dotted, dashed, and dot-dashed curves without (with) open circles are obtained by a0 = − 1, 0, 1, and 2, respectively, from Eq (8) [Eq (10)]. The TMS for other particles with different parameters in Eqs (8) and (10) is also presented. From the left panel to the middle panel and then to the right panel, n changes from 5 to 10 and then to 15. In general, the values of q are very close to 1, which means that the collision system considered by us is approximately in an equilibrium state.

**Methodology/Approach**

The paper uses the Tsallis distribution function to describe the TMS for various particles. The authors apply the Tsallis statistics [6, 7, 8, 9] with a revised index a0, which is deﬁned as a0 = (q − 1) / (q + 2), where q is an entropy index that characterizes the degree of equilibrium or non-equilibrium. The values of T and n are obtained by a least square method to minimize the value of χ2. The parameters in Eqs (8) and (10) are determined from the data of pion, kaon, proton, and antiproton spectra as well as the dielectron and diphoton spectra.

**Results/Data**

The authors present the TMS for various particles with different parameters in Figs 7(a), b, c), d, e, f, g, and h. From the upper panel [Figs 7(a), b, and c)] to the middle panel [Figs 7(d), e, and f], T changes from 0.1 GeV to 0.15 GeV and then to 0.2 GeV. From the left panel to the middle panel and then to the right panel, n changes from 5 to 10 and then to 15. In each panel, the solid, dotted, dashed, and dot-dashed curves without (with) open circles are obtained by a0 = − 1, 0, 1, and 2, respectively, from Eq (8) [Eq (10)]. The TMS for other particles with different parameters in Eqs (8) and (10) is also presented. From the left panel to the middle panel and then to the right panel, n changes from 5 to 10 and then to 15.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The values of revised index a0 are not equal to 1 for most particles in this study. The values of a0 for the ﬁts in Figs 2(a), 4(a), and 6(a) listed in Tables 3 and 4 are not equal to 1 in most cases. In general, Eq (8) is necessary because a0 ̸= 1 in most cases. The values of a0 for the ﬁts in Fig 5(a) and listed in Table 1 are larger than 1 for nearly all heavy-ﬂavor particles, while the values of a0 for others are around 1. The values of a0 for the ﬁts in Figs 2(a), 4(a), and 6(a) are not equal to 1 in most cases. In general, Eq (8) is necessary in the data-driven analysis because a0 ̸= 1 in most cases.
