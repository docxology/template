**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Predictions in the eye of the beholder: A Markov blanket proposal for enactive inference" by Kirchhoff et al. (2020) is a thought-provoking discussion on the nature of mind and its relationship to the world. The authors, who are all prominent figures in the field of predictive processing, argue that the free energy principle (FEP), which has been used to explain a wide range of phenomena from perception to social behavior, is not an inference procedure but rather a theoretical framework for understanding the nature of mind and its relationship to the world. The authors' main point is that the FEP is not a predictive inference algorithm, but rather a theory about what the mind is and how it works, and that this theory should be used as a basis for developing new algorithms or models. They argue that the FEP has been misused in many ways by the field of predictive processing, which they call "vanilla PP," and that there are many different approaches to making predictions within the framework of the FEP.
