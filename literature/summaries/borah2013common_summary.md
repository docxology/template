**Overview/Summary**
The paper presents a new model for explaining the common origin of active and sterile neutrinos in the context of three-flavor seesaw mechanism with an additional right-handed neutrino superfield. The authors consider the case where the right-handed neutrino is not a complete singlet under $SU(2)_L$. In this case, the left-handed Majorana mass matrix has two zero eigenvalues and one non-zero eigenvalue. It is shown that the model can explain the observed active-sterile mixing pattern without introducing any new physics beyond the seesaw mechanism. The authors also consider the possibility of a large $\theta_{13}$ in the framework with an additional right-handed neutrino superfield, which is not a complete singlet under $SU(2)_L$. In this case, the left-handed Majorana mass matrix has two zero eigenvalues and one non-zero eigenvalue. It is shown that the model can explain the observed active-sterile mixing pattern without introducing any new physics beyond the seesaw mechanism.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The authors show that the model with a right-handed neutrino superfield, which is not a complete singlet under $SU(2)_L$, can be consistent with the observed data. The paper also discusses the possibility of a large $\theta_{13}$ in this framework. The authors find that the model can explain the observed active-sterile mixing pattern without introducing any new physics beyond the seesaw mechanism.

**Results/Data**

**Limitations/Discussion**
The authors discuss the possibility of a large $\theta_{13}$ in the framework with an additional right-handed neutrino superfield, which is not a complete singlet under $SU(2)_L$. The authors find that the model can explain the observed active-sterile mixing pattern without introducing any new physics beyond the seesaw mechanism. The authors also discuss the possibility of a large $\theta_{13}$ in this framework.

**Limitations/Weaknesses**
The paper does not consider the case where the right-handed neutrino is a complete singlet under $SU(2)_L$. The authors do not discuss the possibility of a small $\theta_{13}$. The authors also do not mention any future research directions.
