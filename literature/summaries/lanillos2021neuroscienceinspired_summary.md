**Overview/Summary**

The paper proposes a novel perception-action framework for robots based on active inference (AI) and neural networks learning (NNL), which is inspired by the neuroscience of self-other distinction. The authors argue that AI can be used to develop a robot's body representation, and this can be achieved through an end-to-end VAE (Variational Autoencoder) controller in the shared world. The proposed approach is tested on a human-like robot, and it is shown that the robot can learn to perceive its own body from the visual information without any prior knowledge about itself.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this paper are the development of an end-to-end VAE AI controller for active inference in robotics. This approach is tested on a human-like robot, and it is shown that the robot can learn to perceive its own body from the visual information without any prior knowledge about itself. The authors also show that the proposed method can be used to obtain the sensorimotor self through enaction. The key findings are the following: 1) the end-to-end VAE AI controller can be used for active inference in a shared world, and this is tested on a human-like robot; 2) the end-to-end VAE AI controller can be used to obtain the sensorimotor self through enaction.

**Methodology/Approach**

The approach of this paper is based on the neuroscience of self-other distinction. The authors argue that AI can be used to develop a robot's body representation, and this can be achieved through an end-to-end VAE controller in the shared world. The proposed method is tested on a human-like robot, and it is shown that the robot can learn to perceive its own body from the visual information without any prior knowledge about itself.

**Results/Data**

The results of this paper are as follows: 1) the authors show that the end-to-end VAE AI controller can be used for active inference in a shared world, and this is tested on a human-like robot; 2) the end-to-end VAE AI controller can be used to obtain the sensorimotor self through enaction. The data of this paper are the results obtained from the experiments conducted by the authors.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The limitations of this paper are as follows: 1) the proposed approach is tested on a human-like robot, and it is not clear whether the end-to-end VAE AI controller can be used for active inference in other robots; 2) the authors do not provide any comparison with other existing approaches. The discussion of this paper is about the potential applications of the proposed method. The authors also mention some future work.
