**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Information-Seeking Polynomial NARX Model-Predictive Control" by M. Schoukens et al. proposes a new model-predictive control (MPC) framework for the online identification of polynomial nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous inputs (NARX) models that is based on the free energy principle and variational message passing. The authors claim that this MPC approach can be used to learn policies in continuous time, which is a novel application of the active inference paradigm. In this paper, the authors first describe the information-theoretic MPC framework for the online identification of linear systems with colored noise, then extend it to polynomial NARX models. They also discuss the potential applications and future work.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of the paper are threefold. First, the authors derive a new model-predictive control (MPC) framework for the online identification of linear systems with colored noise that is based on the free energy principle. This MPC approach can be used to learn policies in continuous time, which is a novel application of the active inference paradigm. Second, the authors extend this MPC approach to polynomial NARX models. Third, they discuss the potential applications and future work.

**Methodology/Approach**

The first part of the paper starts with an overview of the information-theoretic MPC framework for the online identification of linear systems with colored noise. The authors then describe how to apply the free energy principle to learn policies in continuous time. They also compare this approach with the model-predictive control (MPC) and the variational message passing (VMP) approaches. In the second part, the authors extend the MPC framework for the online identification of linear systems with colored noise to polynomial NARX models. The key idea is that the VMP can be used to learn policies in continuous time. The authors also discuss how this approach can be applied to the online identification of polynomial NARX models.

**Results/Data**

The results and data are presented in the second part of the paper, which starts with a description of the information-theoretic MPC framework for the online identification of linear systems with colored noise. The authors then describe how to apply this approach to learn policies in continuous time. They also compare this approach with the MPC and VMP approaches. In the third part, the authors extend the MPC framework for the online identification of linear systems with colored noise to polynomial NARX models. The key idea is that the VMP can be used to learn policies in continuous time. The authors also discuss how this approach can be applied to the online identification of polynomial NARX models.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The paper does not mention any specific limitations or future work, but it suggests some potential applications and future work.
