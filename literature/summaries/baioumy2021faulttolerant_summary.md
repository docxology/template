**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Fault-tolerant Control of Robot Manipulators with Sensory Faults" by Pezzato et al. (2020) proposes a novel adaptive control strategy for robot manipulators based on the free energy principle, which is a mathematical framework that has been used to model perception and learning in the brain. The authors argue that this approach can be used to design both state and input observers for linear systems with colored noise. They also claim that the proposed method can be extended to nonlinear systems. The paper is organized as follows.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of the paper are the following: (1) a new adaptive controller based on active inference, which is a mathematical framework that has been used to model perception and learning in the brain; (2) an application of this approach to fault-tolerant control. The authors also claim that the proposed method can be extended to nonlinear systems.

**Methodology/Approach**

The first part of the paper provides a brief overview of active inference, which is a mathematical framework that has been used to model perception and learning in the brain. It is based on the idea that the brain minimizes the free energy (or variational free energy) of the world. The authors also discuss how this approach can be used for predictive and reactive control. The second part of the paper proposes an adaptive controller based on active inference, which they claim can be extended to nonlinear systems. The third part of the paper is a simulation study that demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.

**Results/Data**

The results section of the paper presents a simulation study that demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method. The authors use a 7-DOF robot arm as an example, and they compare the performance of the proposed adaptive controller with a traditional PID controller. They also claim that the proposed method can be extended to nonlinear systems.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The paper does not discuss any limitations or future work.
