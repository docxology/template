**Overview/Summary**

The authors present a study using the Stokes radiative transfer code to model the polarization of dusty scattering cones in active galactic nuclei (AGN). The goal is to understand the polarized spectral energy distribution and its dependence on viewing angle, as observed by spectropolarimetry. The paper focuses on the wavelength dependence of the intensity and polarization for two different dust models: a Galactic dust model and an AGN dust model that has been inferred from the extinction properties of AGN. The authors compare their results to those in Goosmann & Gaskell (2007), which assumed a dust composition reproducing the extinction in our Galaxy, but used a different viewing angle. The main focus is on the wavelength dependence of the polarization over the optical/UV range at di erent viewing angles for two types of dust: the Galactic dust model and the AGN dust model that has been inferred from the extinction properties of AGN.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors use the Stokes code to simulate the polarization expected from scattering in the polar regions of an active galactic nucleus (AGN). The goal is to understand the spectral energy distribution and its dependence on viewing angle as observed by spectropolarimetry. The authors find that the polarization spectra are weaker at shorter wavelengths than for the Galactic dust model, and around 4000 A, the polarization curves drop down to nearly zero and then they increase again steeply to longer wavelengths. For the Galactic dust model, the polarization spectra show a more gradual increase over the whole wavelength range considered. The main reason is that the scattering e ciency of the AGN dust is signi cantly smaller than for the Galactic dust. The authors also find similar trends for a larger half-opening angle of 45 degrees.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use the Stokes code and documentation, which are freely available at http://www.stokes-program.info/. The program allows the user to de ne di erent emiss ion and scattering geometries and solve the radiative transfer in 3D. It takes into account polarization induced by scattering o f free electrons and dust grains. The dust composition includes carbonaceous and siliceous grains an d the grain size distributions are parameterized by truncated power laws. The code measures light travel times and thus can be used to model polarization reverberation mapping (Shoji, Gaskell, & Goosmann 2005). The authors use the same procedure as in Goosmann & Gaskell (2007), which assumes a dust composition reproducing the extinction in our Galaxy. However, they here apply a di erent dust parameterization that has been inferred from AGN extinction curves (Gaskell et al. 2004; Gaskell & Benker 2007). The authors use the same procedure as in Goosmann & Gaskell (2007) to model the polarization expected from scattering in the polar regions of an AGN. The optical depth of one cone along the symmetry axis is τV = 0.3 for the V-band, its half-opening angle equals θC = 30 degrees. The authors use the same procedure as in Goosmann & Gaskell (2007) to model the polarization expected from scattering in the polar regions of an AGN. The optical depth of one cone along the symmetry axis is τV = 0.3 for the V-band, its half-opening angle equals θC = 30 degrees.
