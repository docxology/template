**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Constraining Cosmological Parameters with Needlet Internal Linear Combination (NILC) Component Maps" by Hill et al. [1] is a comprehensive study of the internal linear combination (ILC) method, which is an alternative to the traditional internal linear combination (ILC) and the generalized internal linear combination (GILC). The authors investigate the performance of the ILC and GILC methods in constraining cosmological parameters with the needlet ILC (NILC) component maps. They compare the results from the two variants of the HILC method, one using fixed weights and the other using varying weights. The paper is organized as follows.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors show that the GILC method can be used to constrain cosmological parameters with a set of needlet ILC (NILC) component maps. They find that the HILC method with fixed weights performs better than the one with varying weights in constraining ˆACMB and ˆAftSZ, but the two variants are similar in constraining the other cosmological parameters. The authors also compare the results from the ILC and GILC methods.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use the needlet filters that are the difference of successive Gaussians with FWHM values of 300, 120, and 60 arcmin. They build the NILC component maps (the CMB and Compton- y) from the frequency maps with the first noise split and use them to compute the power spectra directly. The authors implement two variants: one with fixed ILC weights and the other with varying ILC weights.

**Results/Data**

The data vector for the NILC component map auto- and cross-power spectra consists of CˆTsplit1, ˆTsplit2b, CˆTsplit1,ˆysplit2b, Cˆysplit1,ˆTsplit2b, and Cˆysplit1,ˆysplit2b. The authors use the HILC method with two variants: one in which the weights are computed once from some fiducial template generated at ˆACMB = 1 = ˆAftSZ and the other in which the weights are re-computed for every simulation realization. In the NILC case, the weight maps are determined separately for every simulation.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors compare the results from the two variants of the HILC method with the GILC method. They find that the HILC method with fixed weights performs better than the one with varying weights in constraining ˆACMB and ˆAftSZ, but the two variants are similar in constraining the other cosmological parameters.
