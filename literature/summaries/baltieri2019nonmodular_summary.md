**Overview/Summary**

The paper by Baltieri and Buckley (2019) presents a novel perspective on how cognitive systems can be understood in terms of active inference, which is the process of generating an internal model of the world based on the sensory data that is available. The authors argue that this process is not only a theoretical construct but also a real-world process that is used by animals to generate their own models of the environment and how they interact with it. The main point of the paper is that the active inference process can be understood as an adaptation problem, where the internal model is the controller and the external world is the plant. This perspective allows for the use of control theory in understanding the cognitive systems. The authors argue that this approach is not only a theoretical construct but also a real-world process that is used by animals to generate their own models of the environment and how they interact with it. 

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main point of the paper is that the active inference process can be understood as an adaptation problem, where the internal model is the controller and the external world is the plant. The authors argue that this approach is not only a theoretical construct but also a real-world process that is used by animals to generate their own models of the environment and how they interact with it. 

**Methodology/Approach**

The paper starts from the basic idea that if an animal has no internal model of its environment, then the sensory data will be meaningless for the animal. The authors argue that this is not only a theoretical construct but also a real-world process that is used by animals to generate their own models of the environment and how they interact with it. 

**Results/Data**

The paper presents an example of the active inference process in the context of phototaxis, where the animal moves towards the light source. The authors argue that this process can be understood as a closed-loop control problem for the internal model. The main point is that the sensory data will not be meaningless if there is an internal model and the sensory data will be used to update the internal model. 

**Limitations/Discussion**

The paper does not discuss any limitations or future work, but it presents some ideas about how this approach can be applied in other contexts. The authors argue that the active inference process can also be understood as a closed-loop control problem for the internal model. This perspective allows for the use of control theory in understanding the cognitive systems.
