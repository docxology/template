**Overview/Summary**

The paper "A Novel Resource Allocation for Anti-Jamming in Cognitive-UAV-Radios" by A. Krayani et al. proposes a novel resource allocation strategy for anti-jamming in cognitive-uav-radios, which uses the active inference approach to minimize the interference caused by the jammer and maximize the throughput of the system. The authors consider a multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) broadcast channel where the base station is equipped with one or more unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and the users are equipped with a single antenna. In this paper, the UAVs are assumed to be deployed in a 3D space and can move according to their trajectories. The authors assume that the jammer has an unlimited power budget and can transmit signals at any time instant. They also consider that the channel gains from the base station to the users and from the jammer to the users are independent and identically distributed. In this paper, the authors formulate the problem as a stochastic optimization problem and solve it by using the active inference approach. The main contributions of the paper are: (1) the authors propose an anti-jamming strategy based on the active inference framework; (2) the authors show that the proposed algorithm can effectively reduce the interference caused by the jammer and maximize the throughput of the system.
