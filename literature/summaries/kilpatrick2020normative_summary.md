**Overview/Summary**

The present study is concerned with the theoretical analysis of patch foraging decisions in the context of a general class of models that are based on the idea that the optimal strategy for an animal to follow when foraging at a given location depends on its current state. The authors consider three different states: hungry, satiated, and full. They also consider two different types of patches: high quality (high value) and low quality (low value). In this context, they provide a general theory that describes the optimal strategy for an animal to follow when it is at a given location. This theory is based on the idea that the optimal strategy depends on the current state of the animal. The authors also consider two different types of patches: high quality and low quality. They show that in the case where the patch type is known, the optimal strategy is to stay until all food has been consumed if the initial rate of foraging is high enough. In this case, there are no nontrivial deviations from the MVT. The authors also consider the case where the observer does not know the patch type and show that in this case, there are nontrivial deviations from the MVT.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contribution of the paper is a general theory for the optimal strategy to follow when at a given location. This theory is based on the idea that the optimal strategy depends on the current state of the animal. The authors also show that in the case where the patch type is known, there are no nontrivial deviations from the MVT. In this case, the MVT is satisﬁed when the initial rate of foraging is high enough. This theory is based on the idea that the optimal strategy depends on the current state of the animal. The authors also consider the case where the observer does not know the patch type and show that in this case, there are nontrivial deviations from the MVT.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors begin by considering a general class of models based on the idea that the optimal strategy for an animal to follow when it is at a given location depends on its current state. The authors consider three different states: hungry, satiated, and full. They also consider two different types of patches: high quality (high value) and low quality (low value). In this context, they provide a general theory that describes the optimal strategy for an animal to follow when it is at a given location. This theory is based on the idea that the optimal strategy depends on the current state of the animal. The authors also consider two different types of patches: high quality and low quality. They show that in the case where the patch type is known, the optimal strategy is to stay until all food has been consumed if the initial rate of foraging is high enough. In this case, there are no nontrivial deviations from the MVT. The authors also consider the case where the observer does not know the patch type and show that in this case, there are nontrivial deviations from the MVT.

**Results/Data**

The authors provide a detailed analysis of the optimal strategy for an animal to follow when it is at a given location. This analysis is based on the idea that the optimal strategy depends on the current state of the animal. The authors also show that in the case where the patch type is known, there are no nontrivial deviations from the MVT. In this case, the MVT is satisﬁed when the initial rate of foraging is high enough. This theory is based on the idea that the optimal strategy depends on the current state of the animal. The authors also consider the case where the observer does not know the patch type and show that in this case, there are nontrivial deviations from the MVT.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The primary reason for a mismatch with the MVT arises due to the discreteness of the food availability and arrival rate. The authors show that for short transit times τ or small food chunk sizes ρ, and ideal observer will depart patches more quickly than when transit times are long τ or food chunks have a higher quality ρ. This is consistent with classic models of continuous consumption as in the MVT, but here we have provided a detailed analysis of the case of discretized and random food encounters. The authors also show that for low initial rate λ0 and decrement ρ, the best strategy is to remain in a patch until all food has been consumed, but as λ0 and ρare increased, the optima occur roughly where Rλθ≈ρas in the MVT. Similar results can be computed in the cases m0=3,4,5,... using explicit computation of the harmonic numbers Hn. The authors expect these results to generalize to arbitrary m0 as evidenced by the small m0 case and our large m0 asymptotics. Overall this suggests that for short transit times τ or small food chunk sizes ρ, and ideal observer will depart patches more quickly than when transit times are long τ or food chunks have a higher quality ρ. This is consistent with classic models of continuous consumption as in the MVT, but here we have provided a detailed analysis of the case of discretized and random food encounters.
