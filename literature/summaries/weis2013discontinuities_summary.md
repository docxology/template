**Summary**

The paper by Weis and Knauf (2012) is a seminal work in the field of non-commutative state spaces. The authors present an axiomatic characterization of the von Neumann entropy for density matrices on a general C*-algebra, which was previously known only for the case where the algebra is the $C^*$-algebra of all bounded operators (or the $W^*$-algebra of all bounded observables) on a separable Hilbert space. The main result of the paper is that the von Neumann entropy is continuous in the weak* topology, and this fact can be used to show that the relative entropy between two density matrices is non-negative. This is an important property for any measure of information or uncertainty in quantum systems.
