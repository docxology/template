I will summarize this scientific research paper.

**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Active Membership Inference Test (aMINT)" by [Authors] is a comprehensive study on the privacy risks of machine learning models in various applications. The authors propose an active membership inference test to detect whether a target model has been trained using sensitive data. This is achieved through a novel attack called "membership inference," which can be used for both white-box and black-box attacks. In this paper, the authors also analyze the difficulty of membership inference attacks against different types of models in various settings.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this work are threefold: (1) The active membership inference test is proposed to detect whether a target model has been trained using sensitive data. This attack can be used for both white-box and black-box attacks. (2) The difficulty of membership inference attacks against different types of models in various settings is analyzed. (3) The authors also analyze the privacy risks of deep learning-based face biometrics, which are widely used in real-world applications.

**Methodology/Approach**

The proposed active membership inference test is based on the idea that a model trained with sensitive data will be more likely to misclassify samples from the same distribution as the training dataset. The authors first introduce the concept of "membership inference" and analyze the difficulty of this attack against different types of models in various settings. Then, they propose an active membership inference test by using the above idea. In the proposed attack, the target model is used to predict the sensitive data. If the target model can correctly classify a sample from the sensitive dataset, it will be misclassified. This is because the sensitive dataset and the training dataset are from the same distribution. The authors also analyze the difficulty of membership inference attacks against different types of models in various settings.

**Results/Data**

The results of this work show that the proposed attack can successfully detect whether a target model has been trained using sensitive data. In addition, the analysis on the difficulty of membership inference attacks against different types of models in various settings is also very useful for understanding the privacy risks of machine learning models.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The limitations and future work of this paper are discussed at the end of the paper. The authors suggest that the proposed attack can be used to detect whether a target model has been trained using sensitive data. This is because the target model will misclassify samples from the same distribution as the training dataset. In addition, the analysis on the difficulty of membership inference attacks against different types of models in various settings is also very useful for understanding the privacy risks of machine learning models.
