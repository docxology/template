**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Message passing- based inference in an autoregressive active inference" by Kouw et al. (2023) presents a novel approach to the problem of inferring the state of an unknown system from a sequence of noisy observations. The authors propose a method for making inferences about the current and future states of the system, which is based on the idea that the best way to make predictions about the future is by using the information available at the present time. This is achieved through the use of a message passing algorithm. The paper also presents an example of how this approach can be used for the purpose of control in a linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) system.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of the paper are the following:

- A new method for making inferences about the current and future states of a system based on the information available at the present time.
- An example of how this approach can be used to make control decisions in an LQG system.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use the concept of the graphical model, which is a probabilistic model that consists of a set of nodes and edges. The nodes are random variables and the edges represent conditional dependence between these random variables. The paper uses the message passing algorithm to make inferences about the current and future states of the system. The message passing algorithm is based on the idea that the best way to make predictions about the future is by using the information available at the present time.

**Results/Data**

The authors use a numerical example to demonstrate how this method can be used for control decisions in an LQG system. This is done through the use of a simulation study, where the performance of the proposed approach is compared with that of the model predictive control (MPC) and the receding horizon control (RHC). The results are presented as a set of tables.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors note that their work can be extended in several ways. For example, the paper does not discuss how to make the approach more efficient. They also do not consider the case where the system is non-linear or when the number of control inputs is greater than one. The authors also do not compare the performance of the proposed method with other approaches that use a different message passing algorithm.
