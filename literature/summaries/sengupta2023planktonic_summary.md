**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Planktonic Active Matter" by [Authors] focuses on the behavior of microorganisms in water that are capable of self-propulsion and can be influenced by external forces such as gravity. The authors discuss the interplay between the gravitationally driven motion of these organisms, known as phytoplankton, and the viscous torques caused by the surrounding fluid. They investigate how the relative strength of the two types of torques determines the direction of their swimming in a given hydrodynamic setting. The paper is organized into eight sections, including an introduction, a discussion on the role of intracellular organelles, the influence of the organelles on gravitactic stability, and the interplay between the gravitationally driven motion and the viscous torques.
