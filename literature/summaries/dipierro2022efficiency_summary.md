**Overview/Summary**

The Lévy flight is a random walk with a power-law jump length distribution, which has been observed in various natural and artificial systems. The authors of this paper study the efficiency functionals for the Lévy flight. Efficiency functionals are a class of functionals that measure the performance of a stochastic process. For the Lévy flight, they obtain the explicit expressions for the expected values of the first two moments of the efficiency functional. These results can be used to analyze the mean and variance of the average jump length. The authors also show that the efficiency functionals are monotonically increasing in the time parameter $s$. In addition, the authors find the exact value of the third moment of the efficiency functional for the Lévy flight. This is the first result on the third moment of the efficiency functionals for the Lévy flight.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions and findings of this paper are as follows:

1. The authors obtain the explicit expressions for the expected values of the first two moments of the efficiency functional, which can be used to analyze the mean and variance of the average jump length. This is the first result on the efficiency functionals for the Lévy flight.

2. The authors show that the efficiency functionals are monotonically increasing in the time parameter $s$. In addition, the authors find the exact value of the third moment of the efficiency functional for the Lévy flight. This is the first result on the third moment of the efficiency functionals for the Lévy flight.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use the method of the Laplace transform and the Mellin-Barnes formula to obtain the explicit expressions for the expected values of the first two moments of the efficiency functional. The authors also use the monotonicity of the efficiency functionals in $s$ to find the exact value of the third moment of the efficiency functional.

**Results/Data**

In this paper, the authors study the Lévy flight. The authors obtain the explicit expressions for the expected values of the first two moments of the efficiency functional. These results can be used to analyze the mean and variance of the average jump length. The authors also show that the efficiency functionals are monotonically increasing in the time parameter $s$. In addition, the authors find the exact value of the third moment of the efficiency functional for the Lévy flight. This is the first result on the third moment of the efficiency functionals for the Lévy flight.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The main limitations and future work of this paper are as follows:

1. The authors only consider the first two moments of the efficiency functionals, which can be used to analyze the mean and variance of the average jump length. However, it is not clear whether the third moment of the efficiency functional has any physical meaning or not.

2. The authors do not discuss the higher order moments of the efficiency functionals for the Lévy flight. It may be interesting to study the higher order moments in the future work.
