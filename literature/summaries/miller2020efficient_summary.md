**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Efficient Graph-Base Active Learning with Probit Likelihood" by Karzand and Nowak proposes a new approach to the problem of active learning on graphs. The authors provide an efficient algorithm for this problem, which is based on the idea of using a probabilistic model as a proxy for the true label distribution in the semi-supervised setting. This paper also provides theoretical guarantees for the proposed algorithm.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of the paper are the following:
- The authors propose an efficient algorithm for active learning on graphs, which is based on the idea of using a probabilistic model as a proxy for the true label distribution in the semi-supervised setting.
- The authors provide theoretical guarantees for the proposed algorithm.

**Methodology/Approach**

The approach used by the authors to solve this problem is based on the idea of using a probabilistic model as a proxy for the true label distribution. The authors use the harmonic function, which is a well-known method in semi-supervised learning and active learning, as a probabilistic model. This paper also provides theoretical guarantees for the proposed algorithm.

**Results/Data**

The results show that the proposed algorithm can be used to solve the problem of active learning on graphs efficiently. The performance of the proposed algorithm is better than some existing algorithms. The authors compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with other algorithms in experiments and find that the proposed algorithm outperforms them. The experimental results also show that the time complexity of the proposed algorithm is linear, which means it can be used to solve large-scale problems.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The main limitations of this paper are as follows:
- The authors only compare their method with some existing algorithms in experiments and do not compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with other active learning methods. It would be better if the authors could provide more comparisons.
- The authors use a simple graph model, which is different from real-world graphs. It would be better if the authors could use a more complex graph model.
