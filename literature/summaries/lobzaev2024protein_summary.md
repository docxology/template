**Overview/Summary**
Protein engineering is an important area of research in which a protein sequence is designed to have specific properties and functions. The authors of the paper describe a new method for designing proteins that they call "protein design by deep network hallucination" (PDN). This method uses a generative model, similar to those used in image generation, to predict the structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence. They train this model on a large dataset of known protein sequences and then use it to generate new proteins that have specific properties. The authors show that their approach can be used to design a wide variety of different types of proteins.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The main contribution of the paper is the generative protein design method, which they call "protein design by deep network hallucination" (PDN). This method uses a neural network to predict the structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence. The authors train this model on a large dataset of known protein sequences and then use it to generate new proteins that have specific properties. The authors show that their approach can be used to design a wide variety of different types of proteins.

**Methodology/Approach**
The authors first describe the generative method for predicting the structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence. They also compare this method with other methods, such as the "inverse" or "template-based" method, in which a new protein is 

**Results/Data**
The results section describes the performance of the PDN method on a variety of different tasks. First, they compare the PDN method with the "inverse" or "template-based" method in which a new protein is 

**Limitations/Discussion**
The paper does not discuss any limitations or future work in detail.
