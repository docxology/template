**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Validation of Free Energy Methods in AMBER" by Tsai et al. (2021) is a comprehensive study that investigates the accuracy and reliability of the widely used molecular mechanics force field AMBER (Assessment of Methods for Energies, Routines, and Databases) in calculating relative free energy differences between two molecules. The authors focus on the validation of the AMBER method using the absolute free energy difference approach and the BAR (Bennett Acceptance Ratio) method. The main goal is to compare the results from the current version of the AMBER force field with its previous version, as well as the unified and split protocols in the calculation of the relative free energy differences between two molecules. The authors use a set of 9 transformations that involve different types of chemical reactions, including gas-to-liquid phase transfer, acid-base neutralization, and aldehyde-hydroxylamine condensation.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main findings of this paper are the validation results of the AMBER method in calculating the relative free energy differences between two molecules. The authors find that the current version of the AMBER force field is more accurate than its previous one, and the unified protocol is more reliable than the split protocol in the calculation of the relative free energy differences. The most important finding is that the absolute hydration free energy values calculated by the split protocol are consistent with the BAR method, which provides a new way to validate the accuracy of the force field. The authors also find that the FEP (Free Energy Perturbation) profiles for the two molecules in the gas and aqueous phases are different from each other.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use the absolute free energy difference approach and the BAR method to calculate the relative free energy differences between two molecules. The absolute hydration free energies are calculated by the split protocol, and the relative hydration free energy is obtained by the difference of the absolute values for the two molecules. The FEP profiles in the gas and aqueous phases are obtained from the calculations using the current version of the AMBER force field (A18*) and the previous one (pA18). The authors use a set of 9 transformations that involve different types of chemical reactions, including gas-to-liquid phase transfer, acid-base neutralization, and aldehyde-hydroxylamine condensation. The authors calculate the relative free energy differences between the two molecules in the gas and aqueous phases for both the pA18 and A18* force fields using the unified and split protocols. The authors also compare the results from the current version of the AMBER force field with its previous one, as well as the unified and split protocols.

**Results/Data**

The paper compares the ΔG(Δ) values (relative free energy differences in the gas phase) for 9 different transformations calculated by the pA18 and A18* force fields using both the unified and the split protocols. The authors find that the current version of the AMBER force field is more accurate than its previous one, and the unified protocol is more reliable than the split protocol in the calculation of the relative free energy differences. The authors also compare the ΔG(Δ) values for 2 different transformations (methanol→ethane and acetic acid→acetaldehyde) calculated by both the pA18 and A18* force fields using the unified and the split protocols. The authors find that the absolute hydration free energy values calculated by the split protocol are consistent with the BAR method, which provides a new way to validate the accuracy of the force field. The authors also find that the FEP profiles for the two molecules in the gas and aqueous phases are different from each other.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The main limitation of this paper is that it only focuses on the validation of the AMBER method using the absolute free energy difference approach and the BAR method, which may not be enough to fully validate the accuracy of the force field. The authors also find that the FEP profiles for the two molecules in the gas and aqueous phases are different from each other. The paper does not discuss the limitations of the current version of the AMBER force field or the unified and split protocols, which may be important to future work.
