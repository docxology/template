**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Free Energy in a Circumplex Model of Emotion" by C. Pattisapu et al. (2022) is an interdisciplinary work that combines insights from psychology and neuroscience with the framework of active inference, a free energy principle-based theory of cognition. The authors argue that emotions can be understood as the outcome of a process of "inference" or "prediction error" in the brain, rather than as a set of discrete entities. They present an empirical study to test this idea using a novel methodology based on the circumplex model of affect (a two-dimensional space with equal intervals between all points) and the free energy principle. The authors' main contribution is the development of a new method for estimating the "emotional state" of a person, which they call "emotional state inference," that can be used to predict the emotional states of others in social situations.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The paper's key contributions are the development and application of this novel methodology. The authors also provide an overview of the circumplex model of affect and its relationship to the free energy principle, as well as a discussion of the theoretical foundations for their approach. In addition, they present a review of the literature on emotions in psychology and neuroscience that is relevant to the paper's main findings.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use a combination of psychological theory (the circumplex model) and computational methods (active inference) to develop an empirical method for estimating the "emotional state" of a person. The study uses a novel methodology based on the circumplex model, which is a two-dimensional space with equal intervals between all points. The authors also review the theoretical foundations for their approach.

**Results/Data**

The paper presents the results of an experiment that was designed to test the authors' main hypothesis. The data are presented in detail and the results are discussed in terms of the circumplex model, which is a two-dimensional space with equal intervals between all points. The authors also present a review of the literature on emotions in psychology and neuroscience.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The paper discusses its limitations and future work.
