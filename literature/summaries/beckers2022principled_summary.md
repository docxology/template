**Overview/Summary**

This paper proposes a principled pruning method for Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) based on the assumption of the prior distribution over the weights in the BNN. The authors first discuss the problem of model selection and the concept of the "no-u-turn" sampler, which is an adaptive MCMC algorithm that can be used to set the path length in Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC). They then present a new method for pruning BNNs based on the assumption of the prior distribution over the weights. The authors first discuss the problem of model selection and the concept of the "no-u-turn" sampler, which is an adaptive MCMC algorithm that can be used to set the path length in Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC).
