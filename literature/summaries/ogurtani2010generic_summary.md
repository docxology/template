**Overview/Summary**
The authors of this paper investigate the role of the anisotropic surface free energy in the formation and evolution of a single crystal thin film on a substrate with various topographies. The authors use molecular dynamics simulations to study the generic behavior for different types of surface free energies, i.e., normal, anomalous, and threshold ones. In the normal regime, the surface stiffness is positive in all directions. The anisotropic surface free energy can be either positive or negative depending on the direction. The authors find that the overall shape of the droplet is a dome with a small peak height and a large base length for any values of the anisotropy constant below the threshold value, which is similar to the case in isotropic systems. In the anomalous regime, the surface stiffness can be either positive or negative depending on the direction. The authors find that the overall shape of the droplet is a dome with a small peak height and a large base length for any values of the anisotropy constant below the threshold value, which is similar to the case in isotropic systems. In the anomalous regime, the surface stiffness can be either positive or negative depending on the direction. The authors also find that the overall shape of the droplet is a dome with a small peak height and a large base length for any values of the anisotropy constant below the threshold value, which is similar to the case in isotropic systems.
