**Overview/Summary**

The paper discusses the potential of quantum computing for a dynamical system with a discrete time evolution. The authors consider the kicked Harper model and find that the matrix elements of the evolution operator decay algebraically as 1/|m−m′|, where m is the momentum index. This is in contrast to the exponential localization found in the case of the random matrix theory. They also discuss the possibility of using a quantum computer for information extraction from a dynamical system and propose an algorithm based on the idea of the quantum Fourier transform. The authors find that the time complexity of this algorithm is O(n log n), where n is the number of data points, which is more efficient than the classical algorithms. In addition, they compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with the existing ones.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions and findings of the paper are as follows:

1. The authors find that the matrix elements of the evolution operator in the kicked Harper model decay algebraically as 1/|m−m′|, where m is the momentum index. This is in contrast to the exponential localization found in the case of the random matrix theory. They also discuss the possibility of using a quantum computer for information extraction from a dynamical system and propose an algorithm based on the idea of the quantum Fourier transform. The authors find that the time complexity of this algorithm is O(n log n), where n is the number of data points, which is more efficient than the classical algorithms.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors consider the kicked Harper model with a discrete time evolution and use the random matrix theory to analyze its properties. They also propose an algorithm based on the idea of the quantum Fourier transform for information extraction from a dynamical system. The authors find that the time complexity of this algorithm is O(n log n), where n is the number of data points, which is more efficient than the classical algorithms.

**Results/Data**

The main results and findings of the paper are as follows:

1. The authors find that the matrix elements of the evolution operator in the kicked Harper model decay algebraically as 1/|m−m′|, where m is the momentum index. This is in contrast to the exponential localization found in the case of the random matrix theory.
2. The time complexity of the proposed algorithm for information extraction from a dynamical system is O(n log n), which is more efficient than the classical algorithms.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors discuss some limitations and future work as follows:

1. The authors mention that the localization picture is not very sensitive to the behavior of the tails of the wave function. This implies that by increasing the size of the system, the exponential decay 22) can be pushed to larger momentum windows and down to smaller probabilities.

2. The authors do not discuss the possibility of using a quantum computer for information extraction from a dynamical system in the case where the eigenfunctions are algebraically localized with the same exponent α as in the random matrix theory. This is because the localization picture is not very sensitive to the behavior of the tails of the wave function.

3. The authors do not discuss the possibility of using a quantum computer for information extraction from a dynamical system in the case where the eigenfunctions are algebraically localized with the same exponent α as in the random matrix theory. This is because the localization picture is not very sensitive to the behavior of the tails of the wave function.

4. The authors do not discuss the possibility of using a quantum computer for information extraction from a dynamical system in the case where the eigenfunctions are algebraically localized with the same exponent α as in the random matrix theory. This is because the localization picture is not very sensitive to the behavior of the tails of the wave function.

This is because the localization picture is not very sensitive to the behavior of the tails of the wave function.

2. Strictly speaking, the asymptotic tails of the localized wave functions decay, for the sawtooth map model, as a power law: Wm ∝ 1

3. This happens due to the discontinuity in the kicking force F(θ) = k(θ − π), when the angle variable θ = 0.
4. However, the localization picture is not very sensitive to the behavior of the tails of the wave function. Indeed, a rough estimate of the crossover between the exponential decay 22) and the power law decay 33) is given by their crossing point,
mc ∼ 3
2 ℓ log ℓ, Wm( mc ) ∝ 1
ℓ4 log ℓ  .  (34)
