**Overview/Summary**

The paper proposes a generalized persistence dynamics for active motion and studies its effects on the probability density function (PDF) of the active particle's position in d-dimensional space. The main feature of the proposed model is that it takes into consideration, in an exact manner, the contribution of active motion characterized by the parameter η, which carries implicitly the mechanism of self-propulsion. This paper also considers the fluctuations of a thermal bath as well. The joint effects of thermal and active fluctuations are encompassed in the total PDF function P(x,t), given by Eq. (6), whose Fourier transform gives us the intermediate scattering function [see Eq. (17)]. Thus, our analysis avoids the sometimes cumbersome hierarchy analysis made for active Brownian and run-and-tumble motion and allows a qualitative comparison with the experimental data for Janus particles [18]. The approach presented in this paper can be extended in various directions. For instance, it is of interest to consider the analysis of the combined effects of general patterns of active motion under the confinement eﬀects of an external field. This case can be treated directly by considering an extra term in the current probability due to the external force. In addition, the eﬀects of spatial heterogeneity on the dynamics of the active particle, such as when the particle motion occurs on a curved surface, are also considered.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main feature of the proposed model is that it gives a smaller weight to events in the past than the corresponding exponential memory of the telegrapher process [15, 21]. This leads to Eq. (13), which corresponds to an original generalization of the well-known telegrapher's equation. Such a generalization takes into consideration, in an exact manner, the contribution of active motion characterized by the parameter η, which carries implicitly, the mechanism of self-propulsion. Our analysis takes into consideration the ﬂuctuations of a thermal bath as well. The joint eﬀects of thermal and active ﬂuctuations are encompassed in the total PDF function P(x,t), given by Eq. (6), whose Fourier transform gives us the intermediate scattering function [see Eq. (17)]. Thus, our analysis avoids the sometimes cumbersome hierarchy analysis made for active Brownian and run-and-tumble motion and allows a qualitative comparison with the experimental data for Janus particles [18]. The connection between ηand the spatial dimensionality d is uncovered by choosing η  = d−1; for this, the "time dimension" plays the same role as the spatial dimension in the context of the generalization of the wave equation of Bietenholz and Gambiagi. In our model, this choice manifestly captures the dynamics of active Brownian motion and run-and-tumble motion, if the relations Γ  = DRd(d−1) and Γ  = λd are satisﬁed.

**Methodology/Approach**

The Smoluchowski-like equation (13) for the PDF Pa(x,t) is derived from the memory function given in Eq. (12). The speciﬁc choice of such a function results in the Smoluchowski-like equation (13) for the probability density function P( x, t ) of the active particle's position in d-dimensional space. The main feature of the memory kernel (12) is that it gives a smaller weight to events in the past than the corresponding exponential memory of the telegrapher process [15, 21]. This leads to Eq. (13), which corresponds to an original generalization of the well-known telegrapher's equation. Such a generalization takes into consideration, in an exact manner, the contribution of active motion characterized by the parameter η, which carries implicitly, the mechanism of self-propulsion. Our analysis takes into consideration the ﬂuctuations of a thermal bath as well. The joint eﬀects of thermal and active ﬂuctuations are encompassed in the total PDF function P( x, t ), given by Eq. (6), whose Fourier transform gives us the intermediate scattering function [see Eq. (17)]. Thus, our analysis avoids the sometimes cumbersome hierarchy analysis made for active Brownian and run-and-tumble motion and allows a qualitative comparison with the experimental data for Janus particles [18]. The approach presented in this paper can be extended in various directions. For instance, it is of interest to consider the analysis of the combined eﬀects of general patterns of active motion under the conﬁnement eﬀects of an external ﬁeld. This case can be treated directly by considering an extra term in the current probability due to the external force. In addition, the eﬀects of spatial heterogeneity on the dynamics of the active particle, such as when the particle motion occurs on a curved surface, are also considered.

**Results/Data**

The time dependence of the mean-squared displacement (MSD) and the kurtosis of the PDF P(x,t), given by Eqs. (14) and (15), respectively, is studied in this paper. The MSD and the kurtosis are calculated as functions of the dimensionless wave number ˜k and the time t. The results for different values of the inverse P´ eclet number ˜D=DT/Γℓ2p are shown in Fig. 1. The ISF, given by Eq. (16), is also studied in this paper. Our results are shown in Fig. 6. The ISF obtained from our model as a function of the dimensionless wave number k is compared with the corresponding ones of RTM and ABM in the case of two dimensions. These last ones are computed by taking the product of exp {−DTk2t}and the Fourier transform of PABM(x,ˆv,t) and PRTM(x,ˆv,t), respectively. Instead of using the expansions in eigefunctions to compute the ISFs, as is done in Ref. [18], we use instead the exact representation of these in the form of continuous fractions which are amenable for numerical evaluation (see Appendix E). The results for different values of the inverse P´ eclet number ˜D=DT/Γℓ2p are shown in Fig. 6 for two diﬀerent values of the inverse P´ eclet number, ˜D  = 0.038 (such as the one used in Fig. 1), and ˜D  = 0.01 for which the eﬀects of active motion are more conspicuous, particularly at times of the order of Γ −1, i.e. ˜k  ∼  1; see central panels. The ISF obtained from our model as a function of the dimensionless wave number k is compared with the corresponding ones of RTM (solid black line) and of ABM (solid red line).

**Limitations/Discussion**

The paper proposes and studies a model for active motion that incorporates the persistence eﬀects of self- propulsion through the memory function given in Eq. (12). The speciﬁc choice of such a function results in the Smoluchowski-like equation (13) for the probability density function P( x, t ) of the active particle's position in d-dimensional space. The main feature of the memory kernel (12) is that it gives a smaller weight to events in the past than the corresponding exponential memory of the telegrapher process [15, 21]. This leads to Eq. (13), which corresponds to an original generalization of the well-known telegrapher's equation. Such a generalization takes into consideration, in an exact manner, the contribution of active motion characterized by the parameter η, which carries implicitly, the mechanism of self-propulsion. Our analysis takes into consideration the ﬂuctuations of a thermal bath as well. The joint eﬀects of thermal and active ﬂuctuations are encompassed in the total PDF function P( x, t ), given by Eq. (6), whose Fourier transform gives us the intermediate scattering function [see Eq. (17)]. Thus, our analysis avoids the sometimes cumbersome hierarchy analysis made for active Brownian and run-and-tumble motion and allows a qualitative comparison with the experimental data for Janus particles [18]. The approach presented in this paper can be extended in various directions. For instance, it is of interest to consider the analysis of the combined eﬀects of general patterns of active motion under the conﬁnement eﬀects of an external ﬁeld. This case can be treated
