**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Marginal and Joint Cross-Entropies" by Andreas Kirsch, Tom Rainforth, and Yarin Gal is a comprehensive work that provides an extensive review of the current state of the art in the field of information-theoretic quantities. The authors aim to provide a unified notation for the various information-theoretic quantities used in machine learning (ML) papers. The paper also discusses the importance of joint predictive distributions and how they can be used as a measure of uncertainty, which is different from the traditional marginal uncertainty. They argue that the current ML literature lacks a principled approach to understanding the role of joint predictive distributions for model selection and hypothesis testing. In 

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors' main contribution is in providing a unified notation for the various information-theoretic quantities that are used in ML papers. The authors also argue that the current literature lacks a principled approach to understanding the role of joint predictive distributions for model selection and hypothesis testing. They show how the marginal likelihood can be used as a measure of uncertainty, which is different from the traditional marginal uncertainty. They provide an extensive review of the current state of the art in the field of information-theoretic quantities. The authors also discuss the importance of joint predictive distributions and how they can be used as a measure of uncertainty, which is different from the traditional marginal uncertainty.
