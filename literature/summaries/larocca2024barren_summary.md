**Overview/Summary**
The paper "Barren plateaus in variational quantum computing" is concerned with the problem of finding a good solution to a given computational task on a parameterized family of unitary operators U(θ) that are parametrized by some set of parameters θ. The authors consider the case where the family of operators is too expressive, so that the optimization landscape has many local minima and the global minimum is not easily accessible from any random initial point. In this case, the optimization problem is said to have a barren plateau, which is a region in the parameter space where the gradient vanishes but the function does not. The authors show that such a situation can occur even if the family of operators is not too expressive, and they give a simple example of a two-qubit circuit whose expressiveness is only O(n), i.e., it has a small number of parameters. This paper is an extension of [11], which considered the case where the family of operators is very expressive (i.e., its size grows exponentially with n). The authors also show that shallow circuits can avoid the probabilistic BPs, but not the deterministic ones.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The main results of this paper are as follows.
1. **Deterministic BPs**: The authors first consider the case where the family of operators is very expressive (i.e., its size grows exponentially with n). In this case, they show that the optimization problem can have a barren plateau. They also give an example of a two-qubit circuit whose expressiveness is only O(n), i.e., it has a small number of parameters. This shows that even if the family of operators is not too expressive, such a situation can still occur.
2. **Probabilistic BPs**: The authors then consider the case where the family of operators is not very expressive (i.e., its size grows polynomially with n). In this case, they show that the optimization problem can have a barren plateau. They also give an example of a two-qubit circuit whose expressiveness is only O(n), i.e., it has a small number of parameters. This shows that even if the family of operators is not too expressive, such a situation can still occur.
3. **Shallow circuits**: The authors next consider the case where the family of operators is very expressive but the optimization problem does not have a BPs. They show that shallow circuits can avoid the probabilistic BPs, but not the deterministic ones.

**Methodology/Approach**
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the authors first give an overview of the previous work on this topic. Then in Section 3, they introduce the main results of the present paper. The proofs are given in Sections 4-6. The authors also give some concluding remarks in Section 7.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The paper has some limitations and future work directions.
1. **Deterministic BPs**: The authors point out that while the present paper shows the existence of a BPs in the optimization problem, it is still an open question whether the optimization problem can have a BPs when the family of operators is not too expressive but the input state has an exponentially large component in the subspace. They also mention that the present paper does not answer the question whether the optimization problem can have a BPs if the initial state and the measurement operator are both very bad.
