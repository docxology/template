**Overview/Summary**

The paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the transverse momentum (pT) spectra of J/ψ, ψ(2S), and Υ(nS) in p+p, p+Pb, Au+Au, and Pb+Pb collisions at various energies. The three distributions are fitted by the two-component Erlang distribution, the Hagedorn function, and the Tsallis-levy function to extract their parameters. The results of these functions are then used to obtain the excitation functions of the parameters. The excitation function of the parameters is found to increase from 39 GeV to 13 TeV. Meanwhile, pT increases (slightly) with event centrality and particle mass and decreases from mid-rapidity to forward rapidity. These tendencies render that these parameters describe the excitation and expansion degrees of the system. At higher energy, larger energy transfer had happened, which results in a higher excitation and expansion degree of the system. In central collisions and at mid-rapidity, larger energy transfer and further multiple-scattering had happened, which also results in a higher excitation and expansion degree of the system. The parameters p0 (T) and n0 (n) increase with the collision energy, which reflects the degree of energy deposition and transfer. In given collisions, there is a negative correlation between p0 (T) and n0 (n). At different energies, there is a positive correlation between p0 (T) and n0 (n).

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main findings of this study are that the excitation functions of parameters pT and T increase from 39 GeV to 13 TeV. Meanwhile, pT increases (slightly) with event centrality and particle mass and decreases from mid-rapidity to forward rapidity. These tendencies render that these parameters describe the excitation and expansion degrees of the system. At higher energy, larger energy transfer had happened, which results in a higher excitation and expansion degree of the system. In central collisions and at mid-rapidity, larger energy transfer and further multiple-scattering had happened, which also results in a higher excitation and expansion degree of the system. The parameters p0 (T) and n0 (n) increase with the collision energy, which reflects the degree of energy deposition and transfer. In given collisions, there is a negative correlation between p0 (T) and n0 (n). At different energies, there is a positive correlation between p0 (T) and n0 (n).

**Methodology/Approach**

The transverse momentum spectra of J/ψ, ψ(2S), and Υ(nS) in p+p, p+Pb, Au+Au, and Pb+Pb collisions over an energy range from 39 GeV to 13 TeV have been analyzed by the two-component Erlang distribution, the Hagedorn function, and the Tsallis-levy function. The function results are approximately in agreement with the experimental data measured by several international collaborations. The values of related parameters are extracted from the fits and the excitation functions of these parameters are obtained.

**Results/Data**

The above parameter tendencies show that the temperature is mass dependent. This is also a refection of the formation time dependence. According to the hydrodynamic behavior, "massive particles coming out of the system earlier in time with smaller radial flow velocities" [59]. This means that with the increase of mass, the formation time decreases, the temperature increases, and the flow velocity decreases. It should be noted that the fact that the massive particles coming out the system earlier is not caused by the high excitation of the system, but the leaver over due to the inertia of massive particles, in the hydrodynamic evolution. The above parameter tendencies show that the temperature is mass dependent. This is also a refection of the formation time dependence.
