**Overview/Summary**
The paper describes a study of the LEP (Large Electron Positron Collider) centre-of-mass energy at the four interaction points (IPs). The main goal is to evaluate the systematic uncertainty in the measurement of this quantity, which is essential for the precise comparison between the data and the theoretical predictions. The authors use the data from 1996 and 1997. The paper also describes the methods used to determine the centre-of-mass energy at each IP and the results obtained.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The main result of this study is a summary of the systematic uncertainties in the measurement of the LEP centre-of-mass energy, which are important for the precise comparison between the data and the theoretical predictions. The authors use the data from 1996 and 1997. The paper also describes the methods used to determine the centre-of-mass energy at each IP and the results obtained.

**Methodology/Approach**
The authors describe the methods they used to evaluate the systematic uncertainties in the measurement of the LEP centre-of-mass energy. They use data from 1996 and 1997. The paper also describes the methods they used to determine the centre-of-mass energy at each IP and the results obtained.

**Results/Data**
The authors describe the results they found, which are a summary of the systematic uncertainties in the measurement of the LEP centre-of-mass energy. They use data from 1996 and 1997. The paper also describes the methods they used to determine the centre-of-mass energy at each IP and the results obtained.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The authors describe the limitations of their study, which are the extrapolation uncertainties in the normalisation derived from NMR-polarisation comparisons, NMR-ﬂux-loop tests and the part of the bending field not measured by the ﬂux-loop. These extrapolation uncertainties dominate the analysis. The subsequent errors concern the polarisation measurement, speciﬁcally its intrinsic precision (which is less than 1 MeV), the possible diﬀerence in energy between electrons and positrons, and the diﬀerence between optics. None of the additional uncertainties from time variations in a ﬁll, and IP speciﬁc corrections contribute an uncertainty greater than 5 MeV.

**Summary of contributions**
The authors summarise their contributions to the 1997 beam energy uncertainty. The contributions from each source of uncertainty described above are summarised in table 3. The ﬁrst groups describe the uncertainty in the normalisation derived from NMR-polarisation comparisons, NMR-ﬂux-loop tests and the part of the bending field not measured by the ﬂux-loop. These extrapolation uncertainties dominate the analysis. The subsequent errors concern the polarisation measurement, speciﬁcally its intrinsic precision (which is less than 1 MeV), the possible diﬀerence in energy between electrons and positrons, and the diﬀerence between optics. None of the additional uncertainties from time variations in a ﬁll, and IP speciﬁc corrections contribute an uncertainty greater than 5 MeV.
