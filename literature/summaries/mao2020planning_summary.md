Planning Low-Carbon Distributed Power Systems: Evaluating the Impact of Carbon Constraints on Optimal Generation and Storage Investment

The increasing penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources in a power system can be mitigated by the integration of energy storage systems, which are critical for ensuring reliability. This paper evaluates the impact of carbon constraints on the optimal investment in distributed generation (DG) and energy storage capacity under different carbon intensity scenarios. The authors use a mixed-integer linear programming model to solve this problem. In the case where no carbon constraint is considered, the DG and energy storage investment are determined by the cost savings from reducing the peak demand. When the carbon intensity of the system is higher than 100 g/kWh, the carbon constraint will promote the use of more renewable sources such as solar power and wind power, and reduce the thermal power plant capacity. The optimal generation portfolio with a zero-carbon target leads to a higher DG investment and lower energy storage investment compared to the case without any carbon constraint. When the carbon intensity is 50 g/kWh, the optimal system will invest in more energy storage than the case where no carbon constraint is considered. In this scenario, the thermal power plant capacity is reduced by 20% and the renewable sources are increased by 15%. The zero-carbon target leads to a higher PV investment and lower wind turbine investment compared to the case without any carbon constraint.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors' paper does not discuss the stability of the system. In this scenario, the stability can be provided by the grid in on-grid scenarios and also through virtual inertia from the battery and wind turbines in oﬀ-grid scenarios [50]. The zero-emission case is not added to these results, since it gives the same result as the oﬀ-grid counterpart. This is due to the assumption that the grid electricity has non-zero carbon intensity.

**Summary/Overview**

This paper evaluates the impact of carbon intensity scenarios on the optimal investment in a distributed power system with different carbon intensity levels. The authors use a mixed-integer linear programming model to solve this problem. In the case where no carbon constraint is considered, the DG and energy storage investment are determined by the cost savings from reducing the peak demand. When the carbon intensity of the system is higher than 100 g/kWh, the carbon constraint will promote the use of more renewable sources such as solar power and wind power, and reduce the thermal power plant capacity. The optimal generation portfolio with a zero-carbon target leads to a higher DG investment and lower energy storage investment compared to the case without any carbon constraint. When the carbon intensity is 50 g/kWh, the optimal system will invest in more energy storage than the case where no carbon constraint is considered. In this scenario, the thermal power plant capacity is reduced by 20% and the renewable sources are increased by 15%. The zero-carbon target leads to a higher PV investment and lower wind turbine investment compared to the case without any carbon constraint.
