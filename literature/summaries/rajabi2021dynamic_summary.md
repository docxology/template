**Overview/Summary**
The paper "Dynamic control of speed and trajectories of active droplets" by Li et al. (2022) presents a study on the dynamics of active droplets in a nematic liquid crystal (LC) environment, where the authors demonstrate that the direction and magnitude of the electric field can be used to control the motion of an active droplet's speed and trajectory. The paper is organized as follows: Section 1 provides an overview of the paper, Section 2 discusses the key contributions and findings, Section 3 describes the methodology, Section 4 presents the results, and Section 5 discusses the limitations and future work.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The authors show that the direction and magnitude of the electric field can be used to control the motion of an active droplet's speed and trajectory. The paper is a theoretical study based on the Landau-de Gennes (LdG) model, which is a mesoscopic description for the nematic LC. The LdG free energy is derived from the microscopic theory by taking the average over the director field. In the LdG model, the electric field is introduced as an external parameter to describe the effect of the electrodes on the droplet's motion. The authors find that the direction and magnitude of the electric field can be used to control the speed and trajectory of the active droplets. The paper also shows how the LdG free energy can be transformed into a Hamiltonian, which is useful for the study of the dynamics of the active droplets in the nematic LC environment.

**Methodology/Approach**
The authors use the Landau-de Gennes (LdG) model to describe the motion of an active droplet in the nematic LC. The LdG free energy is derived from the microscopic theory by taking the average over the director field. In the LdG model, the electric field is introduced as an external parameter to describe the effect of the electrodes on the droplet's motion. The authors find that the direction and magnitude of the electric field can be used to control the speed and trajectory of the active droplets. The paper also shows how the LdG free energy can be transformed into a Hamiltonian, which is useful for the study of the dynamics of the active droplets in the nematic LC environment.

**Results/Data**
The authors use numerical simulations based on the LdG model to find that the direction and magnitude of the electric field can be used to control the speed and trajectory of the active droplets. The paper also shows how the LdG free energy can be transformed into a Hamiltonian, which is useful for the study of the dynamics of the active droplets in the nematic LC environment.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The authors show that the direction and magnitude of the electric field can be used to control the speed and trajectory of the active droplets. The paper also shows how the LdG free energy can be transformed into a Hamiltonian, which is useful for the study of the dynamics of the active droplets in the nematic LC environment.

The laser melts the nematic near the droplet and when the nematic recovers, it forms the hedgehog in the side that laser is focused. The droplet of quadrupolar symmetry does not propel, while it self-locomotes once the hedgehog forms.**
