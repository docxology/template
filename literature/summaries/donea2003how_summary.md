**Overview/Summary**

The paper "How relevant is the torus activity/geometry for the TeV gamma-rays emitted in the jet of M87?" by A.-C. Donea and R.J. Protheroe (2003) reviews the current evidence for the existence of a small-scale dust to gas ratio in the quasar M87, a Fanaroff-Riley Class I radio galaxy. The authors argue that since there is no direct evidence of any thermal emission from its torus, they consider indirect evidence such as BLR activity and ageing arguments to model the cold dust structure of M87. In the context of the jet-accretion disk-torus symbiosis, the paper discusses the interactions of GeV and TeV gamma-rays produced in the jet of M87 with the infrared radiation fields external to the jet, produced by a less active torus. The authors assume that M87 could still have sufficient dust around its nucleus (Fig. 1a) and calculate the optical depth for γ-γ pair production τγγ of GeV-TeV photons emitted by the jet interacting with IR photons from the torus (Fig. 1b). They find that the absorption of TeV gamma-rays by the cold dust is negligible, but the absorption of GeV to 10 TeV photons by γ-γ interactions with the infrared photons produced by a cold torus is also negligible. The authors conclude that the absorption of GeV to 10 TeV photons by γ-γ interactions with the infrared photons produced by a cold torus is negligible. Only a strong and rapid ignition in the nucleus of M87 could heat up the dust and increase the absorption of γ-rays produced nearby the infrared torus.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors find that the optical depth for the absorption of GeV to 10 TeV photons by the cold dust is negligible, but the absorption of TeV gamma-rays by the cold dust in a thin and cold torus with less defined outer boundaries could still present problems. The paper does not provide any new data or results, rather it discusses the implications of the current state of knowledge on the existence and properties of the torus in M87 for the escape of TeV γ-rays from the jet.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use the following indirect arguments to model the cold dust structure of M87: 1) The low luminosity of the nucleus, 2) the fact that strong mid-infrared emission was not detected from the center of M87, and 3) the possibility that M87 could harbour a double black hole system. They assume that M87 could still have sufficient dust around its nucleus (Fig. 1a). The authors calculate the optical depth for γ-γ pair production τγγ of GeV-TeV photons emitted by the jet interacting with IR photons from the torus (Fig. 1b) and conclude that the absorption of TeV gamma-rays by the cold dust is negligible, but the absorption of GeV to 10 TeV photons by the cold dust in a thin and cold torus with less defined outer boundaries could still present problems.

**Results/Data**

The authors find that the optical depth for the absorption of GeV-TeV photons by the cold dust is negligible. The curves are calculated for different temperatures of the dust T0 = (100, 250, 1000) K (from bottom to top). 1000 K is unrealistic for the present near-dormant state of M87; it is interesting to see what the difference would be in absorption when M87 would power on the torus. The authors also find that γ-rays with energies above 10 TeV (if produced) could be absorbed even when the torus is cold and thin, and the emission region lies within the torus. As one moves away from the black hole, the TeV emission if produced in the jet escapes the γ-γ absorption and could be detected by the Cherenkov telescopes.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors conclude that the absorption of GeV to 10 TeV photons by the cold dust is negligible. Only a strong and rapid ignition in the nucleus of M87 could heat up the dust and increase the absorption of γ-rays produced nearby the infrared torus. The paper does not discuss any limitations or future work, but it does point out that the authors' previous work (Donea & Protheroe 2002) has shown that the torus radiation could present a serious problem for the escape of TeV emission from regions which are not well above hot tori. They also mention that M87 is a mis-aligned BL Lac object, with a huge black hole, active jet and BLR, and possibly NLR. The fact that strong mid-infrared emission was not detected from the center of M87 suggests either that there is no torus in M87 or if there is one it should have a low radiative efficiency making its detection difficult.
