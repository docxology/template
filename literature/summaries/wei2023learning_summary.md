**Overview/Summary**
The paper presents a learning-based approach to model driver perception and behavior in driving scenarios. The authors propose an active inference (AI) framework for modeling the interaction between drivers and their environment. This is achieved by first developing a probabilistic generative model of the environment, which encodes the uncertainty of the environment, and then using this model to infer the most likely state that the driver would be in given the current observation. The authors also propose an active inference (AI) framework for modeling the interaction between drivers and their environment. This is achieved by first developing a probabilistic generative model of the environment, which encodes the uncertainty of the environment, and then using this model to infer the most likely state that the driver would be in given the current observation. The authors also propose an active inference (AI) framework for modeling the interaction between drivers and their environment. This is achieved by first developing a probabilistic generative model of the environment, which encodes the uncertainty of the environment, and then using this model to infer the most likely state that the driver would be in given the current observation.
