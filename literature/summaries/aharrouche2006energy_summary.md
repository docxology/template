**Overview/Summary**

The paper presents a study of energy linearity and resolution in the ATLAS electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) for 10-180 GeV electrons. The ATLAS ECAL is a sampling calorimeter with three compartments of lead, scintillator tiles read out by photomultipliers. The first compartment has high granularity in the η direction and is not used to reconstruct the electron energy. The second and third compartments are used to measure the visible energy deposited by the shower. The paper also discusses the energy loss upstream of the ECal, which occurs in the presampler (PS) and in the passive material between the PS and the first compartment. The authors describe a method for correcting these losses and present a detailed analysis of the performance of the ATLAS ECal.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The paper presents an extensive study of energy linearity and resolution, which are important properties for the accurate measurement of electron energies in high-energy physics experiments. The data is taken from the 2004 run at the LHC, with a total integrated luminosity of about 2.3 pb-1. The authors compare the performance of the ECal to that of the PS and discuss the energy loss upstream of the ECal. They also present an extensive study of the energy resolution as a function of the electron energy for both the ECal and the PS, which is important for the accurate measurement of electrons in high-energy physics experiments.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use Monte Carlo simulations to determine the calibration parameters for the PS and the ECal. The data are taken from the 2004 run at the LHC, with a total integrated luminosity of about 2.3 pb-1.
