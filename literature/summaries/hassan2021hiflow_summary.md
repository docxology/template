**Overview/Summary**

The paper "HIFlow: Generating Diverse HI Maps and HI-based Galaxy Clusters" by Villaescusa-Navarro et al. (2021) presents a novel method to generate diverse high-resolution (HI) maps from the IllustrisTNG simulation suite, which is an extension of the Illustris project that includes 6,000 square degrees of the sky at z < 3. The authors use the IllustrisTNG data to create HI maps and galaxy clusters for the first time. The main goal is to generate a large number of high-resolution (HI) maps with different observational parameters and resolutions in order to make the most out of the simulation suite, which can be used as a mock catalog for future surveys. The authors also use the IllustrisTNG data to study the HI-based galaxy clusters and compare them with the optical based ones.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this paper are threefold. First, the authors present the HIFlow code that can be used to generate a large number of high-resolution (HI) maps from the IllustrisTNG simulation suite. The HIFlow code is publicly available and can be run on any computer with enough RAM to process the data. Second, the authors use the HIFlow code to create a set of 6,000 square degrees of HI maps at z < 3 for the first time, which is the largest number of high-resolution (HI) maps that have been generated from the IllustrisTNG simulation suite. Third, the authors compare the optical and HI-based galaxy clusters in this paper. The main finding is that the HI-based galaxy clusters are more diverse than the optical ones. The authors also find a few differences between the two types of galaxy clusters.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use the IllustrisTNG simulation suite to generate the high-resolution (HI) maps. The IllustrisTNG data includes 6,000 square degrees of the sky at z < 3. The Illustris project is a large cosmological hydrodynamical simulation that uses the Planck Collaboration I cosmology and the IllustrisTNG simulation is an extension of the Illustris project. The authors use the IllustrisTNG data to create the high-resolution (HI) maps for the first time, which is the largest number of high-resolution (HI) maps that have been generated from the IllustrisTNG simulation suite. The HIFlow code is publicly available and can be run on any computer with enough RAM to process the data. The authors use the IllustrisTNG data to study the HI-based galaxy clusters.

**Results/Data**

The main results of this paper are the 6,000 square degrees of high-resolution (HI) maps at z < 3 that have been generated from the IllustrisTNG simulation suite. The authors also compare the optical and HI-based galaxy clusters in this paper. The main finding is that the HI-based galaxy clusters are more diverse than the optical ones. The authors also find a few differences between the two types of galaxy clusters.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The main limitation of this paper is that it only compares the optical and (HI) based galaxy clusters. The authors do not discuss the other limitations of the HIFlow code or the IllustrisTNG data. The authors also do not compare the HI-based galaxy clusters with the previous ones in the literature.
