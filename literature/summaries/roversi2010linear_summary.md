Here is a summary of the research paper:

**Overview/Summary**
The paper presents a system called System BV for linear lambda calculus with explicit substitutions, which is a proof search procedure in the deep inference framework. The authors show that this system is NP-complete and present a non-commutative extension of MELL (multiplicative exponential linear logic) in the same framework.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The main contributions are two-fold. First, they develop a new system called System BV for proof search in the deep inference framework. This system is an extension of the original System BV which was presented by Guglielmi and Straßburger (2001). The authors show that this system is NP-complete. Second, they present a non-commutative extension of MELL in the same framework. They also give an example of how to use the new system for a proof search procedure.

**Methodology/Approach**
The authors first develop a new system called System BV for linear lambda calculus with explicit substitutions. This is a proof search procedure in the deep inference framework. The original System BV was presented by Guglielmi and Straßburger (2001). They show that this system is NP-complete. Then, they present a non-commutative extension of MELL. They also give an example of how to use the new system for a proof search procedure.

**Results/Data**
The main results are two-fold. First, they prove that System BV is NP-complete. Second, they show that the non-commutative extension of MELL is in the same complexity class as the original one. The authors also give an example of how to use the new system for a proof search procedure.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The main weakness of this paper is that it does not provide any experimental data or implementation details. It only provides theoretical results and examples. This makes it difficult to compare with other existing systems. The authors do not mention possible future work in the paper, but they mention some related open problems.
