**Overview/Summary**

The paper describes a comprehensive set of two-qubit gates for Rydberg qubits and their implementation using the versatile interaction properties of Rydberg atoms. The authors present a wide range of protocols that can be used to realize different types of entangling operations, including the controlled-Uxy gate (CUxy), which is a special case of the Barenco gate. This paper also provides an overview of the native two-qubit gates for Rydberg qubits and their implementation using the time evolution operator resulting from the physical interactions described by the equations 1 and 4, assuming non-resonant interactions with |g|=0 and |r|=1. The authors describe a set of fast and robust multi-qubit gates that exploit the versatile interaction properties of Rydberg atoms. The paper is organized as follows: First, it describes the native two-qubit gate protocols for Rydberg qubits and the corresponding process diagrams. Then, it gives an overview of these gates and their implementation using the time evolution operator resulting from the physical interactions described by the equations 1 and 4, assuming non-resonant interactions with |g|=0 and |r|=1. The authors describe a set of fast and robust multi-qubit gates that exploit the versatile interaction properties of Rydberg atoms.
