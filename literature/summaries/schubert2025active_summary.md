**Overview/Summary**

The paper proposes an active inference framework for an intelligent agent in autonomous reconnaissance scenarios. The authors argue that a decision-making process entirely based on the data acquired through the agent's sensors is required to achieve operational autonomy and efficiency. In this context, the free energy principle (FEP) can be used as a mathematical foundation for the decision-making process of the agent. The FEP is a mathematical framework that describes how an intelligent system should behave in order to minimize its own surprise or uncertainty about the external environment. The authors apply the FEP to the problem of persistent monitoring, which is a common scenario in autonomous reconnaissance applications. In this problem, the agent must balance exploration and exploitation. Exploration is the process of searching for new information, while exploitation is the process of using the current knowledge to track specific targets. The authors use the FEP as a mathematical framework to describe how an intelligent system should behave in order to minimize its own surprise or uncertainty about the external environment.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this paper are: 1) the application of the free energy principle (FEP) to the problem of persistent monitoring, and 2) the use of a probabilistic model for an intelligent agent in autonomous reconnaissance. The authors propose that the FEP can be used as a mathematical framework to describe how an intelligent system should behave in order to minimize its own surprise or uncertainty about the external environment. This is applied to the problem of persistent monitoring, which is a common scenario in autonomous reconnaissance applications. In this problem, the agent must balance exploration and exploitation. The authors use the FEP as a mathematical framework to describe how an intelligent system should behave in order to minimize its own surprise or uncertainty about the external environment.

**Methodology/Approach**

The paper proposes that the FEP can be used as a mathematical framework to describe how an intelligent system should behave in order to minimize its own surprise or uncertainty about the external environment. The authors propose that the FEP is a mathematical foundation for the decision-making process of the agent. The authors apply the FEP to the problem of persistent monitoring, which is a common scenario in autonomous reconnaissance applications. In this problem, the agent must balance exploration and exploitation. The authors use the FEP as a mathematical framework to describe how an intelligent system should behave in order to minimize its own surprise or uncertainty about the external environment.

**Results/Data**

The paper demonstrates that the technique can be used for the persistent monitoring problem through a simulation of an autonomous reconnaissance scenario. The findings indicate that the technique demonstrates favorable behavior. After navigating the pre-programmed waypoints (the first three targets), the agent continues to search the area in a balanced manner that integrates exploration and exploitation. A qualitative analysis of the images using a stochastic model, along with probabilistic observations and their divergences, provides insights into the level of surprise experienced by the agent. This understanding and the concept of free energy help clarify the reasons and timing behind the agent's decision to scout or pursue a target. When examining the sequence of images throughout a scenario, a behavior that is intuitively and analytically coherent emerges. 

**Limitations/Discussion**

The paper does not discuss the performance of the implemented active inference-based control compared with other control algorithms from the literature. The authors do not compare the results of the implem ented active inference-based control to those of a simple baseline control or, ideally, with several other control algorithms from the literature. A quantitative analysis of the active inference approach to the persistent monitoring problem has not yet been performed. To achieve this, some mission goals need to be formulated, and appropriate metrics for measuring goal fulfillment must be defined. Examples  of performance metrics for a combined tracking and area coverage scenario, similar to the scenario discussed in this paper, can  be found, for instance, in [8]. The perf ormance of the implem ented active inference-based control should be compared to that of a simple baseline control or, ideally, with several other control algorithms from the literature, and for some different scenarios.
