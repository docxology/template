**Overview/Summary**
The paper introduces a class of active inference problems through incentive design and develops a bi-level optimization method to solve a locally optimal solution for the leader's incentive policy. The authors' approach uses conditional entropy to measure uncertainty about followers' types from the leader's partial observations and considers an incentive design with an objective to balance information gain and incentive cost.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The main contributions of the paper are:
1. A new class of active inference problems through incentive design, which is a novel application of game theory in decision-making under uncertainty.
2. The proposed approach uses conditional entropy to measure uncertainty about followers' types from the leader's partial observations and considers an incentive design with an objective to balance information gain and incentive cost.

**Methodology/Approach**
The authors use a bi-level optimization method to solve a locally optimal solution for the leader's incentive policy. The first level is the follower's problem, which is a Markov decision process (MDP) that depends on the followers' types. The second level is the leader's problem, which is an MDP with unknown rewards.

**Results/Data**
The experimental results from two stochastic grid world examples validate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed methods. These two case studies demonstrated the use of incentive design to distinguish users with different capabilities/dynamics and/ or different reward functions.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The paper does not discuss any limitations, but it is a good starting point for future work. The authors suggest that 1) Integrating active inference with adaptive incentive design for personalized systems; 2) Extending the proposed method from model-based to model-free setting, where the leader only has access to collected data from different followers in the past interactions. This extension will be crucial for many practical applications.
