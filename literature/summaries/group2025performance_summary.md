**Overview/Summary**
The CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a particle detector designed to study the fundamental nature of matter and the universe. The Front-End Electronics (FEE) system for the LHCb upgrade, which is scheduled to take place in 2018, will be an essential part of the detector's readout system. It must provide high-speed data transmission to the off-detector HLT processor, as well as a flexible and efficient way to handle the large amount of data produced by the experiment. The FEE system will also have to deal with the large radiation levels that are expected in the LHCb upgrade. This paper describes the performance of the FEE electronics, which is currently being developed for the LHCb upgrade. The FEE system consists of three main components: the Front-End Electronics (FEE), the Readout Driver (ROD) and the Off-detector HLT processor. The FEE will be responsible for the data transmission from the detector to the ROD, which is located in a radiation hard environment. The performance of the FEE electronics has been studied using a test system that includes the FEE and the ROD. The results of this study are presented here.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The main findings of this paper are the performance measurements for the LHCb upgrade FEE, which is currently being developed. These performance measurements are based on the data from the test system that consists of the LHCb upgrade FEE and the ROD. The results show that the LHCb upgrade FEE can provide high-speed data transmission to the off-detector HLT processor. The FEE will be able to handle the large amount of data produced by the experiment. It is also shown that the LHCb upgrade FEE will have a good radiation hardness, which will allow it to operate in the environment where the ROD and the off-detector HLT are located.

**Methodology/Approach**
The performance measurements for the LHCb upgrade FEE were made using a test system. The test system consists of the LHCb upgrade FEE and the ROD. The test system was used to measure the data transmission speed, the latency, the power consumption, the radiation hardness, and the ability of the FEE to handle the large amount of data produced by the experiment.

**Results/Data**
The performance measurements for the LHCb upgrade FEE were made using a test system that consists of the LHCb upgrade FEE and the ROD. The results show that the LHCb upgrade FEE can provide high-speed data transmission to the off-detector HLT processor. The FEE will be able to handle the large amount of data produced by the experiment. It is also shown that the LHCb upgrade FEE will have a good radiation hardness, which will allow it to operate in the environment where the ROD and the off-detector HLT are located.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The main limitation of this study is that the test system was not able to provide data on the performance of the LHCb upgrade FEE under conditions that are similar to those expected for the LHCb upgrade. The results of this study will be used as a guide to help in the development and testing of the LHCb upgrade FEE. It is also important to note that the test system was not able to provide data on the performance of the LHCb upgrade FEE under conditions that are similar to those expected for the LHCb upgrade.

**Summary**
The main findings of this paper are the performance measurements for the LHCb upgrade FEE, which is currently being developed. These performance measurements are based on the data from the test system that consists of the LHCb upgrade FEE and the ROD. The results show that the LHCb upgrade FEE can provide high-speed data transmission to the off-detector HLT processor. The FEE will be able to handle the large amount of data produced by the experiment. It is also shown that the LHCb upgrade FEE will have a good radiation hardness, which will allow it to operate in the environment where the ROD and the off-detector HLT are located.
