**Overview/Summary**

The paper "The Influence of Epistemic Communities on International Political Negotiations about Space Debris" is a historical analysis that examines the role of epistemic communities in shaping the political negotiations at the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) and the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA). The author argues that the epistemic communities, which are groups of people who share a common set of beliefs about how to understand a particular phenomenon, play an important role in shaping the political negotiations at these two organizations. In this case, the epistemic community is the group of scientists and engineers from the International Astronomical Federation (IAF) and the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR), who are concerned with the problem of space debris. The author uses a framework that includes the concept of focusing events to show how the epistemic communities' work in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s influenced the political negotiations at COPUOS and UNOOSA.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The paper finds that the IAF and COSPAR have been a critical part of the process by which the space debris problem has come to be recognized as an important issue in the context of international relations. The author shows how the epistemic communities' work on this topic, particularly their use of statistical indicators, has helped to bring the space debris problem into the political negotiations at COPUOS and UNOOSA. The paper also finds that the IAF and COSPAR have used a number of focusing events to draw attention to this issue.

**Methodology/Approach**

The author uses a historical analysis approach in which he examines the evolution of the debate about space debris over time. This involves looking at the amount of space debris, as well as the political negotiations that occurred at COPUOS and UNOOSA, and how these two are related to each other.

**Results/Data**

The paper finds that the IAF and COSPAR have used a number of focusing events to draw attention to the problem of space debris. The author also shows how the IAF and COSPAR have presented their work on this topic using statistical indicators. These include the amount of space debris, as well as the consequences of the focusing events.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The paper finds that the IAF and COSPAR have been a critical part of the process by which the space debris problem has come to be recognized as an important issue in the context of international relations. The author also shows how the IAF and COSPAR have used a number of focusing events to draw attention to this issue.
