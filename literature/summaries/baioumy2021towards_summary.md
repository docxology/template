Overview/Summary:
The paper "Towards Stochastic Fault-tolerant Control using Predictive Coding" by Pezzato et al. (2020) is a study in the field of robotics and control theory. The authors present a novel approach to fault-tolerant control, which they term "control as inference", that can be used for both adaptive and robust control. This paper is an extension of the work in [13], where the authors presented the first formulation of this problem. In this paper, the authors provide a more detailed analysis of the problem, and propose a new algorithm to solve it. The main contribution of the paper is that the proposed approach can be used for both adaptive and robust control. The authors also provide an experimental study on a humanoid robot.

Key Contributions/Findings:
The main contributions of this paper are the following: (1) A novel formulation of the problem of fault-tolerant control, which they term "control as inference", is presented. This approach can be used for both adaptive and robust control. The authors also provide an experimental study on a humanoid robot.

Methodology/Approach:
The proposed algorithm is based on the active inference framework [3]. In this paper, the authors first formulate the problem of fault-tolerant control as "control as inference". This approach can be used for both adaptive and robust control. The authors then provide an experimental study on a humanoid robot.

Results/Data:
This section should summarize the main results from the paper. It is not necessary to include all the details in this section, but you need to mention the main results. For example, if the paper presents some new algorithms or methods, you can describe them briefly and also give the experimental results. If the paper does not present any new algorithm or method, you can summarize the main results as follows: The authors first formulate the problem of fault-tolerant control as "control as inference". This approach can be used for both adaptive and robust control. The authors then provide an experimental study on a humanoid robot.

Limitations/Discussion:
The authors also discuss some limitations and future work in this paper. For example, they mention that the proposed algorithm is only valid under certain conditions, and it may not be suitable for all situations. They also mention that there are many other problems to be studied in the field of fault-tolerant control.
