**Overview/Summary**

The paper proposes a first competitive ant colony (ACA) scheme for the capacitated arc routing problem (CARP). The CARP is a well-known NP-complete combinatorial optimization problem that has been extensively studied in the literature and has many real-world applications. The authors present an ACA algorithm to solve this problem, which is based on the idea of the ant colony system. The paper also provides a comprehensive comparison with other metaheuristics for the CARP.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of the paper are the design and implementation of the first competitive ACA scheme for the CARP. Compared to the existing algorithms, the proposed algorithm is more efficient in terms of quality and speed. The authors also compare their algorithm with other metaheuristics, such as genetic algorithm (GA) and ant colony system (ACS). The results show that the proposed algorithm can obtain better solutions than the GAs and ACSs.

**Methodology/Approach**

The first part of the paper is an overview of the existing algorithms for the CARP. The authors then present a detailed description of their ACA scheme, including the initialization of the ant colony, the pheromone model, the heuristic rules, the local search procedure, and the termination condition. The second part of the paper is the experimental results. The authors compare the proposed algorithm with other metaheuristics for the CARP.

**Results/Data**

The experimental results show that the proposed ACA scheme can obtain better solutions than the GAs and ACSs. The authors also provide a comparison between their algorithm and the existing algorithms, such as Hertz's tabu search (TS), Li's GA, Eglese's TS, and Reimann's SA.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The paper only provides the experimental results for the proposed ACA scheme. It is not clear that how to improve the proposed algorithm. The authors do not compare the proposed algorithm with other algorithms in terms of computational time. The authors also do not provide any theoretical analysis about the convergence of their algorithm.
