**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Dynamic causal modelling of phase- amplitude interactions" by Friston et al. (2016) is a theoretical study that provides a new perspective on the role of phase-amplitude coupling in the brain's resting state. The authors use dynamic causal modelling (DCM), a Bayesian approach to infer the causal structure of the underlying neural processes, to examine the relationship between the two main types of spontaneous brain activity: the slow oscillations and the fast gamma band activity that are typically observed during the resting state. They show that the phase-amplitude interactions in the brain's resting state can be understood as a dynamic interplay between the default mode network (DMN) and the frontoparietal control network (FPCN). The DMN is thought to be responsible for the slow oscillations, while the FPCN is responsible for the fast gamma band activity. They also show that the phase-amplitude interactions in the brain's resting state are dynamic rather than static, and the two networks have a reciprocal relationship with each other.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main finding of this paper is that the slow oscillations (slow waves) and the fast gamma band activity (gamma waves) in the brain's resting state can be understood as a dynamic interplay between the default mode network (DMN) and the frontoparietal control network (FPCN). The DMN is thought to be responsible for the slow waves, while the FPCN is responsible for the gamma waves. This is based on the results of the DCM analysis that shows that the phase-amplitude interactions in the brain's resting state are dynamic rather than static. The two networks have a reciprocal relationship with each other.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use the DCM, which is a Bayesian approach to infer the causal structure of the underlying neural processes, to examine the relationship between the slow waves and the gamma waves in the brain's resting state. The DCM is used to model the interactions between the two main types of spontaneous brain activity: the slow oscillations (slow waves) and the fast gamma band activity that are typically observed during the resting state. The authors use a variational approach for the DCM, which is called the "DEM" (dynamic expectation maximisation). This is based on the Bayesian inference framework with an empirical Bayes prior. The DEM is used to model the interactions between the two main types of spontaneous brain activity: the slow waves and the gamma waves. The authors also use the "generalised filtering" approach, which is a new method for DCM that they introduce in this paper.

**Results/Data**

The results of the DCM analysis are based on the fMRI data from 14 healthy subjects. The authors find that the phase-amplitude interactions in the brain's resting state can be understood as a dynamic interplay between the DMN and the FPCN. They also show that the phase-amplitude interactions in the brain's resting state are dynamic rather than static, and the two networks have a reciprocal relationship with each other.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The main weakness of this paper is that it only provides an overview of the DCM approach for the fMRI data from 14 healthy subjects. The authors do not provide any statistical tests to support their claims. This makes it difficult to compare the results of this study with those from other studies. It would be better if the authors could provide some statistical tests to support their claims.

The authors use the "generalised filtering" approach for the DCM that they introduce in this paper. This is based on the Bayesian inference framework with an empirical Bayes prior. The "generalised filtering" approach is a new method for DCM that they introduce in this paper. The authors also use the "variational treatment of dynamic systems" (the DEM) for the DCM, which is called the "DEM". This is based on the Bayesian inference framework with an empirical Bayes prior. The "generalised filtering" and the "variational treatment of dynamic systems" are both used to model the interactions between the two main types of spontaneous brain activity: the slow waves and the gamma waves.
