**Overview/Summary**
The paper proposes a new approach to active probing with multimodal predictions for motion planning in autonomous driving scenarios. The authors present an algorithm that uses a combination of two different prediction models based on the concept of "shielding" and "influencing". Shielding is when the robot tries to predict what the human will do, while influencing is when the robot actively tries to change the human's behavior. In this paper, the authors focus on the former. The main contribution of the paper is a new approach that uses multimodal predictions as a way to make the motion planning more robust against uncertainty in the human's behavior.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The key contributions are:
1. A new active probing algorithm for motion planning with multimodal predictions.
2. The authors show that their approach can be used to predict the human's behavior and then use this prediction to make a decision about how to proceed (e.g., whether to shield or not).
3. The authors compare the performance of their approach to a baseline approach that uses only one prediction model.

**Methodology/Approach**
The paper is organized as follows: First, the authors describe the problem and introduce the concept of "shielding" in motion planning. Next, they present the new algorithm for active probing with multimodal predictions. They then compare the performance of their algorithm to a baseline approach that uses only one prediction model.

**Results/Data**
The results are:
1. The authors show that their approach can be used to predict the human's behavior and then use this prediction to make a decision about how to proceed (e.g., whether to shield or not).
2. They compare the performance of their algorithm to a baseline approach that uses only one prediction model.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The limitations are:
1. The authors do not discuss any future work in the paper.
2. The authors do not provide any experimental data for the new algorithm, but they do show some results from experiments with the baseline algorithm.
