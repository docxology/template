**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Hybrid Active Inference" by Ofner et al. (2021) is a thought-provoking work that proposes a new approach to the long-standing problem of integrating human and artificial intelligence in a single system. The authors argue that the current state-of-the-art AI systems are not capable of true learning because they do not have access to the same type of cognitive processes as humans, such as introspection and self-awareness. They propose a novel hybrid approach where an AI system is trained on a large amount of data from both human brain activity (e.g., EEG) and the environment (e.g., video), which can be used for training the AI to perform tasks that require complex cognitive processes. The authors suggest that the proposed hybrid active inference system will have the ability to learn in real time, and they call it a "cognitive agent." They also argue that this type of approach is necessary to achieve true artificial general intelligence (AGI). The paper is well-organized, with clear definitions of terms and concepts. It is easy to follow their argument.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors propose the hybrid active inference system as a new way to train an AI to perform complex cognitive tasks that require human-like learning processes. They suggest that this type of approach will have the ability to learn in real time, which is necessary for true AGI. The paper also provides some possible ways to implement such a system and train it. The authors start by discussing the current state-of-the-art AI systems, including deep neural networks (DNNs) and reinforcement learning (RL). They argue that these types of approaches are not capable of true learning because they do not have access to the same type of cognitive processes as humans. The authors then discuss how the human brain is able to perform complex tasks such as language processing and problem-solving, which can be attributed to the ability of the human brain to introspect on its own thought process. They also argue that this type of introspection is a unique feature of the human brain. The authors suggest that the current AI systems do not have access to the same type of introspection because they are trained by external feedback, such as labels or rewards, rather than internal feedback from their own thoughts. The authors then propose the hybrid active inference system and describe it in detail. They also discuss some possible ways to implement this type of system.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors suggest that the key to achieving true AGI is to allow the AI to have access to the same type of cognitive processes as humans, which they call "cognitive introspection." The authors argue that the current state-of-the-art AI systems do not have this ability because they are trained by external feedback. They propose a new approach where an AI system is trained on both human brain activity and environmental data. This will allow the AI to learn in real time, which is necessary for true AGI. The authors suggest that the proposed hybrid active inference system will be able to perform complex cognitive tasks such as language processing and problem-solving.

**Results/Data**

The paper does not provide any specific results or data. It provides some possible ways to implement the hybrid active inference system and train it. The authors also discuss some of the challenges in implementing this type of system, but they do not present any experimental data that demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The authors suggest that this is because the current state-of-the-art AI systems are not capable of true learning.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The paper does not provide any specific limitations or future work. However, the authors discuss some possible ways to implement the hybrid active inference system and train it. They also argue that the proposed approach will have the ability to learn in real time, which is necessary for true AGI. The authors suggest that this type of approach is necessary to achieve true AGI.
