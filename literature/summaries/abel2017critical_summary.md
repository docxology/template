**Overview/Summary**

The paper "A Critical Review of Validation, Blind Testing, and Free Energy Calculations in Structure-Based Drug Discovery" by Robert Abel et al. is a comprehensive review that critically evaluates the current state of validation, blind testing, and free energy calculations in structure-based drug discovery (SBDD). The authors provide an extensive overview of the history and current status of these three key components of SBDD, with the goal of providing recommendations for future research directions. The paper starts by discussing the importance of the first two topics in the context of the third, as well as the challenges that they pose to the field. The authors also highlight the lack of a widely accepted framework for validation and blind testing in the field, which is particularly important given the increasing reliance on free energy calculations in SBDD.
