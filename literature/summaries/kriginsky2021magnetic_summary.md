**Overview/Summary**

The paper presents a method to infer the magnetic field in active region coronal loops using a combination of spectroscopic and imaging observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) instrument. The authors use the HMI's high spatial resolution and cadence data to identify the footpoints of the coronal loop, which are then used as input for the magnetic field inference. The method is applied to a set of 12 loops observed in the Fe I 6302 Å line that are associated with an active region (AR) on the solar disk. The active region is also observed by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) instrument, which provides high cadence and high spatial resolution data for the same wavelength. The AIA data are used to infer the temperature of the coronal loop using the differential emission measure (DEM). The DEM analysis is performed in a 2D manner, with the temperature at each pixel being determined by the ratio of the intensity in the Fe I 6301 Å line to that in the Fe I 6302 Å line. The authors use the DEM data as input for the magnetic field inference. The method used in this paper is based on the one developed by Kriginsky et al. (2020), which uses a combination of the HMI and AIA observations. In the Kriginsky et al. (2020) method, the temperature at each pixel is determined using the DEM analysis. Then, the magnetic field is inferred from the Doppler shift in the Fe I 6302 Å line. The authors also use the same method as Kriginsky et al. (2020), but with a different set of loops. The authors compare the results obtained by the two methods and find that the temperature at each pixel can be determined using the DEM analysis, which is then used to infer the magnetic field. This paper does not present any new data or method for the magnetic field inference, but rather presents the result of the application of a previously developed method.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors use the same set of coronal loops as Kriginsky et al. (2020), and they find that the temperature at each pixel can be determined using the DEM analysis. The temperature is then used to infer the magnetic field, which is the main result of this paper. The results are compared with those obtained by Kriginsky et al. (2020). The authors find that the two methods give the same results for all 12 loops in their sample.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use a combination of the HMI and AIA data to determine the temperature at each pixel in the coronal loop. The DEM analysis is performed in a 2D manner, with the temperature at each pixel being determined by the ratio of the intensity in the Fe I 6301 Å line to that in the Fe I 6302 Å line. The authors use the same method as Kriginsky et al. (2020), but with a different set of loops. The DEM analysis is performed for all 12 coronal loops, and then the temperature at each pixel is used to infer the magnetic field. The authors compare the results obtained by the two methods and find that the two methods give the same results for all 12 loops in their sample.

**Results/Data**

The authors use a combination of the HMI and AIA data to determine the temperature at each pixel in the coronal loop. The DEM analysis is performed for all 12 coronal loops, and then the temperature at each pixel is used to infer the magnetic field. The results are compared with those obtained by Kriginsky et al. (2020). The authors find that the two methods give the same results for all 12 loops in their sample.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors do not present any new data or method for the magnetic field inference, but rather present the result of the application of a previously developed method. The authors compare the results obtained by the two methods and find that the two methods give the same results for all 12 loops in their sample. The authors note that the DEM analysis is not able to determine the temperature at each pixel with high accuracy. The authors also mention that the magnetic field inference is only possible if the footpoint of the coronal loop can be identified. The authors do not discuss any future work, but they conclude by stating that the DEM analysis is a useful tool for the magnetic field inference.
