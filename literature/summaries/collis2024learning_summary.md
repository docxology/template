**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Learning in Hybrid Active Inference Models" by Parr et al. (2022) is a work on the intersection of machine learning and cognitive science that aims to bridge the gap between the two fields. The authors propose an active inference framework for learning hybrid models, which can be used as a general tool for both model-based and model-free reinforcement learning in continuous state spaces. In this paper, the authors first provide a brief overview of the current state-of-the-art in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and its limitations. Then they introduce the concept of active inference (AI), which is an inference framework that can be used to learn both model-based and model-free DRL. The authors also discuss the relationship between AI and control as inference, and how this relationship can be used to improve the understanding of human learning and cognition. Finally, the authors provide a summary of the current state-of-the-art in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and its limitations.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors first provide a brief overview of the current state-of-the-art in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and its limitations. Then they introduce the concept of active inference (AI), which is an inference framework that can be used to learn both model-based and model-free DRL.

**Results/Data**

The paper does not contain any results or data. It only contains the theoretical analysis based on the active inference framework.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The limitations of the current state-of-the-art in DRL are that it is difficult to learn hybrid models, which can be used as a general tool for both model-based and model-free DRL. The authors also point out some potential future work directions: (1) In this paper, the authors only discuss the theoretical analysis based on the active inference framework. They do not provide any experimental results or data. (2) The authors assume that the state space is continuous. However, in many real-world applications, the state space can be discrete. Therefore, it would be interesting to extend the current work to the case where the state space is discrete.
