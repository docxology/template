Overview/Summary:
The paper presents a new deep learning architecture called Convolutional Vision Transformer (CvT) for cosmology parameter estimation. The authors apply the vision transformer (ViT) to the problem of estimating two cosmological parameters, the Hubble constant and the dark energy equation-of-state, using the 3D power spectrum from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey. They use a set of synthetic DES data with realistic noise and foregrounds. The authors find that the CPT is able to recover the two cosmological parameters in a more efficient manner than the traditional approach. The paper also presents a new method for estimating the marginal posteriors, which are the full conditional distributions over all other model parameters. They use this method to estimate the two cosmological parameters and compare it with the traditional approach.
