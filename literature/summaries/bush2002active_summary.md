**Overview/Summary**

The paper proposes a novel approach to predict and analyze the security of active virtual network management (AVNMP) in a complex system. The authors argue that the complexity of the AVNMP is a useful framework for understanding how an attacker can penetrate a system, and that by knowing the complexity of different components of the system, it may be possible to understand the vulnerabilities of the entire system. This approach is based on the idea that if there is low complexity in the input/output observation pairs, then it is likely to be easy for an attacker to understand the system. The authors use a simple inverse compression ratio as the measure of complexity. In this paper, they apply the density metric to analyze the complexity of different components in a sample active network application and show how the vulnerability can be quantified by using the density metric error. They also propose a novel approach for predicting the security of AVNMP based on the complexity surface.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors first develop a framework that is useful for understanding how an attacker can penetrate a system, and then apply this framework to analyze the vulnerability of different components in a sample active network application. The results show that if there is low complexity in the input/output observation pairs, it is likely to be easy for an attacker to understand the system. This is because the density metric error acts as a resistance, while its inverse acts as conductance, supporting insecurity flows. The authors also propose a novel approach for predicting the security of AVNMP based on the complexity surface.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use a simple inverse compression ratio from Equation 1 as the measure of complexity. They apply the density metric to analyze the complexity of different components in a sample active network application and show how the vulnerability can be quantified by using the density metric error. The X-axis is the number of input and output observations concatenated together. From Figure 21, it would appear that Component E is most vulnerable due to its consistently low complexity while Component B appears to be the least vulnerable due to its larger complexity. These results make intuitive sense because Component E simply forwards data without any form of protection while Component B adds noise to the data. This vulnerability method does not take into account whether a component reduces or increases complexity; in other words, whether the change was endothermic or exothermic complexity.

**Results/Data**

The authors use a topological view of components in a sample system under analysis. The nodes are active application components and the links are security relationships between the components; the links are quantified using Kolmogorov Complexity-based vulnerability analysis. The START state, located in the center of the topology, represents a location outside the system that is not vulnerable to an attacker. In Figure 25, a matrix is generated that shows the cost, in terms of complexity, of traveling from any node to any other node in the K-Map. The resulting flow matrix in Figure 27 shows the security ﬂow through the K-Map graph using the node positions as shown in Figure 24. Density (K(x)/l(x)) from Deﬁnition 1, acts as a resistance, while its inverse acts as conductance, supporting insecurity ﬂows as illustrated in Figure 28. The resulting flow matrix in Figure 27 shows the security ﬂow through the K-Map graph using the node positions as shown in Figure 24.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors do not take into account whether a component reduces or increases complexity; in other words, whether the change was endothermic or exothermic complexity. The results from density estimates taken of accumulated input and output of three separate components of the active network application are shown in Figure 21. The graph shows the complexity of bit-level input and output strings concatenated together. That is, every input sequence is concatenated with an output sequence and the density of the sequence is recorded at the bit-level. The input/output concatenation is generated either for individual components of the system or for a composition of components. If there is low complexity in the input/output observation pairs, then it is likely to be easy for an attacker to understand the system, as in Deﬁnition 1. The X-axis is the number of input and output observations concatenated together. From Figure 21, it would appear that Component E is most vulnerable due to its consistently low complexity while Component B appears to be the least vulnerable due to its larger complexity. These results make intuitive sense because Component E simply forwards data without any form of protection while Component B adds noise to the data.
