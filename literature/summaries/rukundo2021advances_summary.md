**Overview/Summary**
The paper proposes an advance on image interpolation based on ant colony algorithm (ACO). Unlike the authors' previous work that employed a local weighting scheme, the presented ACO algorithm uses a novel global weighting scheme. The strength of the proposed global weighting depends solely on employing solely the pheromone matrix information to decide which case deserves a maximum global weight value or not. The use of max and mean global weight values has shown that the proposed ACO algorithm is able to reduce the interpolation errors with reference to the original image. This was proved by the experiments conducted on full and partial Cameraman, Lenna, Lake and Pepper test images.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The main contribution of this paper is an advance on image interpolation based on ant colony algorithm (ACO). The authors' previous work employed a local weighting scheme, but the presented ACO algorithm used however a novel global weighting scheme. The strength of the proposed global weighting depends solely on employing solely the pheromone matrix information to decide which case deserves a maximum global weight value or not. The use of max and mean global weight values has shown that the proposed ACO algorithm is able to reduce the interpolation errors with reference to the original image. This was proved by the experiments conducted on full and partial Cameraman, Lenna, Lake and Pepper test images.

**Methodology/Approach**

The strength of the proposed global weighting depends solely on employing solely the pheromone matrix information to decide which case deserves a maximum global weight value or not.

**Results/Data**
The authors' previous work employed a local weighting scheme, but the presented ACO algorithm used however a novel global weighting scheme. The strength of the proposed global weighting depends solely on employing solely the pheromone matrix information to decide which case deserves a maximum global weight value or not. The use of max and mean global weight values has shown that the proposed ACO algorithm is able to reduce the interpolation errors with reference to the original image. This was proved by the experiments conducted on full and partial Cameraman, Lenna, Lake and Pepper test images.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The future development of the proposed approach may be devoted to settling the computational load issue by restricting the movements of ants on some parts of an image. The paper does not discuss any limitations or weaknesses in detail. However, it is mentioned that the authors' previous work was limited to a local weighting scheme and this limitation has been overcome in the present ACO algorithm.
