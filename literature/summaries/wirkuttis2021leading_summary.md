**Overview/Summary**
The paper presents a novel approach to dyadic robot imitative interaction based on the predictive coding framework. The authors propose an online learning method for a humanoid robot that can learn from human demonstrations and perform various actions in a natural way, such as following or leading. In this paper, they focus on the role of prediction ability in the sense of agency and internal representation. They also investigate how the dyadic interaction between humans and robots is asymmetric in terms of the sense of agency and internal representation. The authors use an online learning method that can learn to perceive the world as probabilistic or deterministic via inter-action with others, and they conduct a neuro-robotics experiment using a humanoid robot.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The main contributions are the development of a novel predictive-coding-inspired variational recurrent neural network (PC-RNN) model for online prediction and recognition. The authors also investigate how the dyadic interaction between humans and robots is asymmetric in terms of the sense of agency and internal representation. The PC-RNN model can learn to perceive the world as probabilistic or deterministic via inter-action with others, and it can be used to deal with large-scale spatio-temporal patterns in imitative interaction between a robot and a human by using the predictive coding framework. The authors also investigate how the dyadic interaction between humans and robots is asymmetric in terms of the sense of agency and internal representation.

**Methodology/Approach**
The authors use an online learning method that can learn to perceive the world as probabilistic or deterministic via inter-action with others, and they conduct a neuro-robotics experiment using a humanoid robot. The PC-RNN model can be used to deal with large-scale spatio-temporal patterns in imitative interaction between a robot and a human by using the predictive coding framework.

**Results/Data**
The authors use a humanoid robot for their experiments. They find that the dyadic interaction is asymmetric in terms of the sense of agency and internal representation. The results also show that the robot can learn to perceive the world as probabilistic or deterministic via inter-action with others, and it can be used to deal with large-scale spatio-temporal patterns in imitative interaction between a robot and a human by using the predictive coding framework.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The authors suggest some future work. The main limitations are that the dyadic interaction is asymmetric in terms of the sense of agency and internal representation, but it is not clear whether this is due to the prediction ability or other factors. The authors also suggest that the human's prediction ability could be a factor for the asymmetry. They also mention that the large-scale spatio-temporal patterns are difficult to deal with by using the current method.
