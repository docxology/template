**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Active Flows and Deformable Surfaces in 3D" by [Authors] (2020) is a comprehensive study that explores the interplay between active flows and deformable surfaces in three-dimensional space. The authors introduce a new, general framework for understanding how these two types of materials can be coupled to create complex, dynamic patterns. Active flows are materials whose internal state is characterized by an evolving velocity field, such as a liquid or a gas. Deformable surfaces are materials that change their shape in response to the application of stress. The authors demonstrate that when active flows and deformable surfaces interact, they can create intricate patterns, including ones with novel properties not seen before. They also show how this interplay can be used to create new types of matter, such as a "smart" material that is capable of self-organization. This paper provides an overview of the key contributions and findings in the paper.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors' main goal is to provide a general framework for understanding the behavior of active flows and deformable surfaces. The authors use this framework to demonstrate some of the new properties that can be created by the interplay between these two types of materials, including ones with novel properties not seen before. They also show how the interplay between active flows and deformable surfaces can be used to create new types of matter.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors' approach is to use a general framework for understanding the behavior of active flows and deformable surfaces. The authors use this framework to demonstrate some of the new properties that can be created by the interplay between these two types of materials, including ones with novel properties not seen before.

**Results/Data**

The authors show how the interplay between active flows and deformable surfaces can create intricate patterns, including ones with novel properties. They also show how this interplay can be used to create new types of matter. The authors demonstrate that the interplay between active flows and deformable surfaces can be used to create a "smart" material that is capable of self-organization.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The paper does not discuss any limitations or future work.
