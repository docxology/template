Title: Collaborative Optimization of Multi- microgrids System

Abstract: This paper proposes a collaborative optimization framework for multi-microgrids (MGs) system to minimize the dependence on the main grid and improve the economics of MGs. The problem is formulated as a two-stage stochastic game, where the first stage is the bidding process of shared energy storage (SES), and the second stage is the operation and maintenance (OEM) process of MGs. In the first stage, the SES and three MGs are considered as players to solve the stochastic game. The MA-WoLF-PHC algorithm is proposed for the bidding problem based on the multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG). In the second stage, the CTDE algorithm is applied to optimize the OEM process of MGs. The results show that the scheduling strategy proposed in this paper can meet the requirements of stable operation while minimizing the dependence on the main grid. This not only reduces the burden on the main grid but also improves the economics of MGs. On the one hand, the MA-SAC algorithm improved by Mixed-Attention can reasonably provide a reasonable energy management strategy for MG1, MG2, and MG3, on the other hand, MA-WoLF-PHC provides a feasible bidding strategy to promote the participation of shared SES in the OEM problem by solving the stochastic game. In Fig. 15(a), Fig. 16(a) and Fig. 17(a), electricity exchange occurs between MG1, MG2 and MG3 several times. Between 10:00-20:00, in MG1, due to the sudden increase in electrical load and the decrease in PV and WT, there is a lack of electricity, and this part of the electric energy just makes up for the electricity imbalance of MG2 and MG3. In this case, both the electricity purchased by MG1 from the main grid and the electricity sold by MG2, MG3 to the main grid can be reduced, which is very helpful to keep the main grid running stably. When considering the participation of SES and energy trading between MGs, which reduce the number of times MG1 exchanges electricity with the main grid from 18 times to 5 times, and the total electricity exchanged is reduced from 843.9kW to 272.1kW in 24h. For MG2, the amount of electricity excha nged with the main grid is reduced from 941.2kW to 109.4kW. For MG3, is 1751.8kW to 920.0kW. It can also be found in Fig. 18(a) that due to the continuous increase of the power load of MG1 during 11:00-20:00, the ORC equipment can also be flexibly controlled.
