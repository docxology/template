**Overview/Summary**

The paper by Storchi-Bergmann et al. (2007) presents an observational study of the feeding of active galactic nuclei (AGN), which are powered by a supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the center of a galaxy. The authors investigate the relationship between the AGN and its host galaxy, as well as the properties of the AGN itself. They find that the AGN is often surrounded by an extended radio source, with 80% of their sample having one or more jet components. The jets are typically aligned within 20 degrees of the minor axis of the disk, but there is no correlation between the position angle and the inclination of the host galaxy's major axis. The authors also find that the AGN is often surrounded by a dust lane, which may be a signpost for an ongoing merger. They conclude that the feeding of the AGN is not correlated with the presence or absence of a jet, but it is correlated with the presence of a dust lane.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors find that 80% of their sample of 25 Seyfert galaxies have one or more radio components. The radio sources are typically aligned within 20 degrees of the minor axis of the host galaxy's disk. However, there is no correlation between the position angle and the inclination of the major axis of the host galaxy. They also find that the AGN is often surrounded by a dust lane, which may be a signpost for an ongoing merger. The authors conclude that the feeding of the AGN is not correlated with the presence or absence of a jet, but it is correlated with the presence of a dust lane.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use a sample of 25 Seyfert galaxies to study the relationship between the AGN and its host galaxy. The sample consists of 15 H II region (HII) nuclei, 5 LINER (laser), and 5 type-1 quasars. They first select the sample from the literature based on the classification of the nucleus as a Seyfert 1 or 2. Then they use the published data to calculate the position angle of the radio source with respect to the major axis of the host galaxy's disk, as well as the inclination of the major axis of the host galaxy. The authors also find that the AGN is often surrounded by a dust lane, which may be a signpost for an ongoing merger.

**Results/Data**

The authors find that 80% of their sample have one or more radio components. The radio sources are typically aligned within 20 degrees of the minor axis of the host galaxy's disk. However, there is no correlation between the position angle and the inclination of the major axis of the host galaxy. They also find that the AGN is often surrounded by a dust lane, which may be a signpost for an ongoing merger.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors conclude that the feeding of the AGN is not correlated with the presence or absence of a jet, but it is correlated with the presence of a dust lane. The authors also find that the AGN and its host galaxy are often misaligned, which may be due to an ongoing merger. They also note that the sample size is small, so these results should be treated as preliminary until more data are available.
