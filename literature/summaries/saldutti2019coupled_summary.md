**Overview/Summary**

The paper presents a coupled Bloch-wave analysis of an active photonic crystal (PhC) waveguide, which is a one-dimensional periodic structure with the refractive index modulated in time. The authors consider the case where the modulation period is much larger than the wavelength and the waveguide is not necessarily a bandgap material. The paper focuses on the coupled Bloch-wave analysis of an active PhC waveguide when the gain- induced coupling between counter-propagating waves is taken into account, which is different from the conventional analysis in [7]. In this case, the authors find that the gain-induced cross-coupling has a key role to play in limiting the maximum attainable slow light enhancement of gain. Moreover, this coupled Bloch-wave approach strongly affects the lasing mode threshold gain properties of PhC lasers.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main results are (i) the authors find that the gain-induced cross-coupling has a key role to play in limiting the maximum attainable slow light enhancement of gain and (ii) this coupling strongly affects the lasing mode threshold gain properties of PhC lasers. The paper also presents some numerical results for the onset of lasing of the various modes, which well reproduce the experimental [2] and numerical [3] trends.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use a coupled Bloch-wave approach to study the active PhC waveguide with the gain-induced cross-coupling. The paper is based on the previous work in [6]. In this case, the authors find that the gain-induced cross-coupling has a key role to play in limiting the maximum attainable slow light enhancement of gain and (ii) this coupling strongly affects the lasing mode threshold gain properties of PhC lasers.

**Results/Data**

The paper presents some numerical results for the onset of lasing of the various modes, which well reproduce the experimental [2] and numerical [3] trends. The frequency shift of mode ܯ
ଵ	 towards the slow light region observed by increasing the cavity length (Fig. 2c) is consistent with that reported in [2] and obtained with a non-perturbative treatment. Conversely, without the gain-induced distributed feedback, the group index and the effective gain resulting from the slow light enhancement would monotonically increase towards the band-edge; consequently, the cavity would behave as a slow light enhanced FP laser and, independently of the cavity length, the mode M
0 would be the sole lasing one. The authors also present, at each cavity length, all the longitudinal modes and corresponding threshold gain (Fig. 2c,d). The frequency shift of mode ܯ
ଵ	 towards the slow light region observed by increasing the cavity length (Fig. 2c) well reproduces the experimental [2] and numerical [3] trends. Conversely, without the gain-induced distributed feedback, the group index and the effective gain resulting from the slow light enhancement would monotonically increase towards the band-edge; consequently, the cavity would behave as a slow light enhanced FP laser and, independently of the cavity length, the mode M
0 would be the sole lasing one.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The paper does not discuss any limitations or future work.
