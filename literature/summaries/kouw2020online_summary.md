**Overview/Summary**

The paper by Kouw et al. (2020) presents an online system identification method for a Duffing oscillator that is based on the free energy principle. The authors propose a novel approach to identify the parameters of the model using the variational message passing algorithm, which is a type of expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. This paper is organized as follows: First, the overview and summary are given in this section. Then, the methodology/approach used by the authors is described in the next section. The results/data obtained from the experiments are presented in the following section. Finally, the limitations and discussion of the work are given in the last two sections.
