**Overview/Summary**

This paper proposes a novel approach to image analysis by using an artificial ant colony in a digital image habitat. The authors argue that ants are capable of self-organization and collective intelligence, which is the main feature for the development of distributed, adaptive, and bio-inspired mathematical morphology. The authors' aim is to design new operators as artificial living organisms. In this sense, not only do the ant systems receive feedback from any digital image habitat, but they can even change the habitat accordingly.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, the authors propose a novel approach for image analysis based on an artificial ant colony in a digital image habitat. The second contribution is that the present work may lead to a new way to develop more powerful computational perceptive systems towards an distributed, adaptive, and bio-inspired mathematical morphology.

**Methodology/Approach**

The methodology of this paper is divided into two parts: the first part is about the artificial ant colony in digital image habitats and the second one is about the design of MM operators as artificial living organisms. The authors use a simple model for the ant system, which includes an environment (the digital image) and some ants that are able to move around this environment. In each time step, the ants can sense the environment and change their position according to the current situation. The authors also propose a basic rule for the movement of the ants: if there is no food in the current location, the ant will move to its neighboring cell; otherwise, it will stay at that location. If an ant finds food in its current location, it will stay and then change its color to black. The authors use this simple model to simulate the behavior of real ants. They also propose a basic rule for the movement of the ants: if there is no food in the current location, the ant will move to its neighboring cell; otherwise, it will stay at that location. If an ant finds food in its current location, it will stay and then change its color to black.

**Results/Data**

The authors use this simple model to simulate the behavior of real ants. The results are presented as a sequence of images with different colors. The first image is a white image where there is no food; the last one is an image where all the cells have been visited and changed their color to black. In the middle, some of the cells have been visited but not yet changed their color to black. The authors also present the results as a sequence of images with different colors.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors acknowledge that the present work may lead to a new way to develop more powerful computational perceptive systems towards an distributed, adaptive, and bio-inspired mathematical morphology. The authors also point out that the present work could stimulate better research results along this direction.
