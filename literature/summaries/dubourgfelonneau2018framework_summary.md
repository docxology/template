**Overview/Summary**
A Framework for Implementing Machine Learning on Omics Data is a research paper that presents a deep learning pipeline to analyze high dimensional omics data from disparate sources and predict clinical outcomes. The authors of this paper are primarily interested in opening up the vast amount of omics data to machine learning researchers, which has been largely inaccessible due to the complexity of the data. In 

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The main contribution of the paper is a deep learning pipeline that enables the use of high dimensional omics data from disparate sources to predict clinical outcomes. The authors demonstrate this through prediction of short term survival in breast cancer patients with the hope of greater monitoring and care for those patients at high risk. The authors believe this will be especially beneﬁcial in opening up omics data to machine learning researchers.

**Methodology/Approach**
The paper presents a pipeline tool for easier experimentation and reproducibility in other datasets across diseases. This pipeline allows the user to perform the following; model wrapping - handling custom models that respect a simple interface; cross validation - automatic cross validation for evaluation; hyperparameter optimization - scanning a wide parameter space across multiple computational platforms using hyperopt; distribute the data - seamless data distribution across compute clusters.
