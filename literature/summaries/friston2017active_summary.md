**Overview/Summary**

The paper describes a process theory of active inference, which is a new approach to understanding how our brains make decisions and learn from experience. The authors propose that the brain is not just a passive receiver of sensory input but rather an active participant in the construction of the world around us. In this framework, the brain is constantly trying to infer what is going on in the environment based on the information it receives. This process theory can be applied to many different types of learning and decision-making situations.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors describe a new approach to understanding how our brains make decisions and learn from experience. The main contribution of this paper is the description of the active inference process, which is a new way of thinking about how the brain makes predictions based on sensory input. This framework can be applied to many different learning and decision-making situations.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors provide a detailed mathematical description of the active inference process. The approach is based on a statistical model that is used in many areas of science, including physics, computer science, biology, and mathematics. They describe how this statistical model can be applied to understanding the brain's role in making predictions about the world.

**Results/Data**

The authors use an example of foraging in a maze as a way to illustrate the active inference process. The T-maze is a simple maze with four locations: the center, and the upper and lower right and left arms. In this maze, there are two primary rewards that can be obtained (food) and one cue that is not rewarding per se but tells the animal where the reward is located. The agent has to make only two moves in order to obtain the food. First, it must go to the lower arm of the T-maze to find out which arm contains the food. Then, if the food is found, the agent can retrieve the food at the cued location.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors discuss some limitations and future work for this approach. They note that the current framework does not account for the brain's ability to learn from experience. This learning will be addressed in a subsequent paper. The authors also point out that the active inference process is a new way of thinking about how the brain makes predictions based on sensory input, but it can be applied to many different learning and decision-making situations.

**Summary**

The authors provide an overview of their paper. They describe the main contribution as the description of the active inference process. The approach is based on a statistical model that has been used in many areas of science. They use an example of foraging in a maze to illustrate how the active inference process works. This framework can be applied to many different learning and decision-making situations.
