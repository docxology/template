**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Fiducial inference then and now" by A.P. Dempster is a comprehensive review of the history of the fiducial argument in statistics. The author starts with an overview of the current state of the field, which he describes as being in a state of disarray. He suggests that the confusion about the status of the fiducial argument stems from the fact that it has been treated as both a general method for statistical inference and a special case of Bayesian inference. The paper is organized around this dichotomy, with the first part discussing the history of the fiducial argument in its role as a general method for statistical inference, and the second part discussing the history of the fiducial argument in its role as a special case of Bayesian inference.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contribution of the paper is to provide a detailed historical account of the development of the fiducial argument. The author provides an extensive bibliography that includes many references to the original papers and reviews of the literature, which will be useful for those who want to learn more about this topic.
