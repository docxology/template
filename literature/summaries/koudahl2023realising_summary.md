**Overview/Summary**

The paper proposes a new approach to planning in partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) by introducing synthetic active inference agents. The authors argue that the existing approaches for POMDP are not suitable when the number of possible states is large, and the problem size grows exponentially with this number. They propose an alternative method based on a new class of algorithms called synthetic active inference (SAI), which can be used to solve POMDPs in polynomial time. The authors claim that their approach is more efficient than existing approaches for POMDPs.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contribution of the paper is the introduction of SAI, a new class of algorithms that can be used to solve POMDPs in polynomial time. The authors also propose an alternative way to compute the expected future utility (EFE) using the CFFG. They show that their approach is more efficient than existing approaches for POMDPs.

**Methodology/Approach**

The paper starts by explaining the problem of planning in POMDPs and how it can be solved with the EFE. The authors then introduce a new class of algorithms called synthetic active inference (SAI), which can be used to solve POMDPs in polynomial time. They also propose an alternative way to compute the EFE using the CFFG. The authors claim that their approach is more efficient than existing approaches for POMDPs.

**Results/Data**

The paper does not present any experimental results or data. It only provides a theoretical analysis of the SAI and its application in computing the EFE. The authors do not compare the efficiency of the proposed method with the existing methods. They also do not provide an empirical evaluation of their approach.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The paper does not present any experimental results or data. It only provides a theoretical analysis of the SAI and its application in computing the EFE. The authors do not compare the efficiency of the proposed method with the existing methods. They also do not provide an empirical evaluation of their approach.
