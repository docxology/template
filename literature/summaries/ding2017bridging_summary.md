**Overview/Summary**

The paper "A paradox from randomization-based causal inference (with discussion)" by Ding and Dasgupta (2016) is a thought-provoking contribution to the ongoing debate on the foundations of statistical inference in randomized experiments. The authors' main point is that, under some conditions, regression adjustment can be justified for estimating the average treatment effect in a completely randomized experiment with two treatments. This conclusion has been challenged by Freedman (2008b) and others. In 

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main finding is that there are some conditions under which regression adjustment can be justified for estimating the average treatment effect in a completely randomized experiment with two treatments. The authors' conclusion is not new: it was also reached by Balzer et al. (2016) and Rigdon and Hudgens (2015). However, the paper's contribution to this debate is that it provides an alternative explanation of why regression adjustment can be justified under these conditions. This alternative explanation is based on a different set of assumptions than those used in the previous two papers. The authors' explanation is more intuitive and easier to understand than the previous two papers', but it also has some limitations.

**Methodology/Approach**

The paper's methodology is not directly relevant to 

**Results/Data**

The paper does not report any new data. Instead, it provides some examples and counterexamples based on the existing literature. For example, the authors' main finding is that if we have two completely randomized experiments with different sample sizes, then one of them may be used to estimate the average treatment effect in the other experiment.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The paper's findings are not new: Balzer et al. (2016) and Rigdon and Hudgens (2015) also reached the same conclusion. The authors' explanation is more intuitive than those of the previous two papers, but it has some limitations. First, the authors do not provide a formal proof for their main finding. Second, the paper's alternative explanation may be less general than the previous two papers', as it relies on the fact that regression adjustment can be justified in the case with one treatment. Third, the authors' conclusion is based on an assumption that is not satisfied under some conditions. The paper also does not provide a discussion of the limitations and future work.
