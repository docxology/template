**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Active Inference and Human--Computer Interaction" by Murray- Smith et al. (2021) presents a new perspective on the relationship between human-computer interaction and the mathematical framework of active inference, which is based on Bayesian inference. The authors argue that the traditional approach to understanding human behavior in the context of computer systems has been too narrow, as it only considers the user's role in the system. In this paper, they present a new perspective by considering both the user and the computer as agents in an interaction loop, which is based on active inference. The authors use the term "mutual interaction" to describe the relationship between the human and the computer in the context of the interaction process. They argue that the traditional approach has been too narrow because it only considers the user's role in the system. In this paper, they present a new perspective by considering both the user and the computer as agents in an interaction loop, which is based on active inference.
