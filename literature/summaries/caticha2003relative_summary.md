**Summary**

This paper presents a theory of inductive inference based on relative entropy and the axiomatic approach to generalizing from special cases. The authors show that the relative entropy is a universal tool for processing testable information and that the Boltzmann distribution is the unique solution to the problem of finding the maximum-entropy distribution subject to the constraint that the expected energy be given. In this paper, the authors develop a theory of inductive inference based on the axiomatic approach to generalizing from special cases. The relative entropy is a universal tool for processing testable information and the Boltzmann distribution is the unique solution to the problem of finding the maximum-entropy distribution subject to the constraint that the expected energy be given. The authors show that the relative entropy is a universal tool for processing testable information and that the Boltzmann distribution is the unique solution to the problem of finding the maximum-entropy distribution subject to the constraint that the expected energy be given.
