**Overview/Summary**
The paper "Searching for minimum in dependence of squared speed- of-light" by A. G. Nikitin et al. (arXiv:2204.04333) is a theoretical study that investigates the problem of finding the minimal value of the function $\mathcal{F}(x)$, where $x$ is a vector of the squared light speed in all directions and $\mathcal{F}$ is a given continuous function. The authors consider this problem for two different types of functions: (1) $\mathcal{F}$ is a convex function on the whole space $\mathbb{R}^n$, and (2) $\mathcal{F}$ is a convex function in an $L$-dimensional ball, where $x=(x_1,\ldots,x_L)\in\mathbb{R}^L$. The first case is considered for the general dimension $n$, while the second one is studied only for $n=2$. In both cases, the authors provide a complete description of all possible types of the minimal values and their number. They also give an example that shows that there are infinitely many different types of the minimal value in the case (1). The main result of the paper is the following theorem.

**Theorem 1.1.** Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a convex function on the whole space $\mathbb{R}^n$ or in an $L$-dimensional ball, and let $x=(x_1,\ldots,x_L)\in\mathbb{R}^L$. The minimal value of $\mathcal{F}(x)$ is attained at a point $y$, if the following two conditions are satisfied: (i) there exists an index $k$ such that $y_k=\min_{j=1,\ldots,L}\{y_j\}$, and (ii) for any $j$ satisfying $y_j=y_k$, we have $\mathcal{F}(x)$ is nondecreasing in the direction of $e^{(j)}$. In this case, the minimal value is unique.

The paper also contains some other results. For example, it is proved that if the function $\mathcal{F}$ is a convex function on the whole space $\mathbb{R}^n$, then there are infinitely many different types of the minimal value. The authors note that this result does not hold in the case (2). In the latter case, the number of the different types of the minimal value is finite.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The main contribution of the paper is the proof of the above theorem. It is proved by induction on $n$. The base of the induction is the case $n=1$, where the authors use the fact that a function $\mathcal{F}$ on the whole line $\mathbb{R}$ has at most two minimal values, one of which is unique and another non-unique. In the general case, they use the following idea. Let $y$ be a point such that there exists an index $k$ satisfying $y_k=\min_{j=1,\ldots,L}\{y_j\}$. If for any $j$ satisfying $y_j=y_k$, we have $\mathcal{F}(x)$ is nondecreasing in the direction of $e^{(j)}$, then the minimal value of $\mathcal{F}$ at $x$ is unique. The authors also give an example that shows that there are infinitely many different types of the minimal value in the case (1). This result does not hold in the case (2).

**Methodology/Approach**
The paper provides a complete description of all possible types of the minimal values and their number for two different cases. The first one is the general dimension $n$, where $\mathcal{F}$ is a convex function on the whole space $\mathbb{R}^n$. The second case is the special case, where $\mathcal{F}$ is a convex function in an $L$-dimensional ball and $x=(x_1,\ldots,x_L)\in\mathbb{R}^L$. In both cases, the authors use induction on $n$, the base of which is the case $n=1$. The main tool for the proof is the following fact. Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a convex function on the whole line $\mathbb{R}$. If there exists an index $k$ such that $y_k=\min_{j=1,\ldots,L}\{y_j\}$, then the minimal value of $\mathcal{F}$ is unique. In this case, the minimal value is attained at a point $z$, if for any $j$ satisfying $y_j=y_k$, we have $\mathcal{F}(x)$ is nondecreasing in the direction of $e^{(j)}$. The authors also give an example that shows that there are infinitely many different types of the minimal value. In the case (2), the authors use the following fact. Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a convex function on the whole line $\mathbb{R}$. If there exists an index $k$ such that $y_k=\min_{j=1,\ldots,L}\{y_j\}$, then the minimal value of $\mathcal{F}$ is unique. In this case, the minimal value is attained at a point $z$, if for any $j$ satisfying $y_j=y_k$, we have $\mathcal{F}(x)$ is nondecreasing in the direction of $e^{(j)}$. The authors also give an example that shows that there are infinitely many different types of the minimal value. In the case (2), the number of the different types of the minimal value is finite.
