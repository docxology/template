**Overview/Summary**

The paper presents a novel approach for learning cost functions in reinforcement learning (RL) from demonstrations of an agent's behavior. The authors propose the Active Task-Inferring-Guided Deep Inference (ATIDI) algorithm, which is designed to learn the reward function and policy simultaneously by minimizing the difference between the observed and predicted trajectories. The key idea is that the cost function can be inferred from the task description, and the reward function can be learned from the demonstrations of an agent's behavior. The authors show that the ATIDI algorithm outperforms existing approaches in learning a cost function for path planning in urban environments.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this paper are:

1. **Active Task-Inferring-Guided Deep Inference (ATIDI) Algorithm**: This is an end-to-end deep RL algorithm that learns the reward function and policy simultaneously by minimizing the difference between the observed and predicted trajectories. The authors show that the ATIDI algorithm outperforms existing approaches in learning a cost function for path planning in urban environments.
2. **Reward Function Learning**: The authors propose to learn the reward function from the demonstrations of an agent's behavior, which is different from the traditional approach where the reward function is given by humans. This is achieved by inferring the task description and then using the inferred task description to learn the reward function.
3. **Cost Function Learning**: The cost function can be learned from the demonstrations of an agent's behavior. The authors show that the ATIDI algorithm outperforms existing approaches in learning a cost function for path planning in urban environments.

**Methodology/Approach**

The proposed approach is based on the following two key ideas:

1. **Task-Inferring-Guided Deep Inference (TIDI) Algorithm**: This is an end-to-end deep RL algorithm that learns the reward function and policy simultaneously by minimizing the difference between the observed and predicted trajectories. The authors show that the TIDI algorithm outperforms existing approaches in learning a cost function for path planning in urban environments.
2. **Reward Function Learning**: The authors propose to learn the reward function from the demonstrations of an agent's behavior, which is different from the traditional approach where the reward function is given by humans. This is achieved by inferring the task description and then using the inferred task description to learn the reward function.

**Results/Data**

The proposed algorithm is evaluated on a real-world dataset for path planning in urban environments. The results show that the ATIDI algorithm outperforms existing approaches. The authors also compare their approach with other state-of-the-art cost learning algorithms, including HIRL and LTL. The comparison shows that the TIDI algorithm outperforms the baselines.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The main limitations of this paper are:

2. **Comparison with Baselines**: The proposed algorithm outperforms existing approaches in terms of both the two evaluation metrics.
