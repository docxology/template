**Overview/Summary**
The paper presents a novel approach to active learning in the context of clinical image classification tasks, particularly for fine-grained OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography) classiﬁcation. The authors propose an algorithm called DECAL that can be used as a drop-in replacement for any existing training method. They show that by using this algorithm, the number of labeled samples required to achieve a certain level of performance is signiﬁcantly reduced. 

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The key contributions and ﬁndings of the paper are:

1. The authors introduce an active learning approach for OCT classiﬁcation that can be used as a drop-in replacement for any existing training method.
2. They show that by using this algorithm, the number of labeled samples required to achieve a certain level of performance is signiﬁcantly reduced.

**Methodology/Approach**
The authors propose an active learning approach called DECAL (DEployable Clinical Active Learning) that can be used as a drop-in replacement for any existing training method. The algorithm is based on the idea that the training data should not only include labeled samples but also unlabeled ones, and the selection of the next sample to label should not only depend on the model's uncertainty about the classiﬁcation result but also on the density of the training pool. 

**Results/Data**
The authors show that by using this algorithm, the number of labeled samples required to achieve a certain level of performance is signiﬁcantly reduced.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The limitations and future work of the paper are:

1. The authors mention that the proposed method can be used for other image classiﬁcation tasks in addition to OCT.
2. They also mention that the proposed method can be combined with other methods, such as deep Bayesian active learning (DBAL), which is a core-set approach.
