**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Active RIS vs. Passive RIS: Which will prevail in 6G?" by Zhang et al. (2021) is a research article that focuses on the performance comparison between active and passive reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) in wireless communication systems. The authors discuss the challenges of the current wireless communication systems, such as the limited spectrum resources and the high energy consumption. They also introduce the concept of RIS, which can be used to enhance the system capacity and reduce the energy consumption by adjusting the phase shifters on the surface. In this paper, the authors first review the recent progress in the literature about the RIS technology. Then, they compare the performance between the active RIS and the passive RIS. The main results of the article are that the active RIS can achieve better system capacity than the passive RIS when the number of users is small. However, if the number of users increases, the system capacity of the active RIS will decrease. In addition, the authors also compare the performance between the fully connected and the sub-connected RISs. The main results are that the fully connected RIS can achieve better system capacity than the sub-connected RIS when the number of users is small. However, if the number of users increases, the system capacity of the fully connected RIS will decrease.
