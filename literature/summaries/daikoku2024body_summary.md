**Overview/Summary**

This study investigates how bodily sensations are mapped to emotions in a professional dance group and whether this interoceptive awareness is associated with emotional awareness. The authors of the paper used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure brain activity while participants were watching videos that elicited different emotions, such as happiness, sadness, fear, anger, or disgust. They found that dancers have increased interoceptive accuracy compared to non-dancers and that this is associated with a higher level of emotional awareness. The authors also found that the relationship between interoceptive accuracy and emotional awareness was not specific to any particular emotion, but rather general across all emotions.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main findings of the paper are that dancers have increased interoceptive accuracy compared to non-dancers and that this is associated with a higher level of emotional awareness. The authors also found that the relationship between interoceptive accuracy and emotional awareness was not specific to any particular emotion, but rather general across all emotions.

**Methodology/Approach**

The study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure brain activity while participants were watching videos that elicited different emotions. The fMRI data were then analyzed using a statistical technique called the "interoceptive mapping" approach. This approach is based on the idea that interoception is the process of perceiving physiological sensations in one's own body, such as heart rate or breathing, and that this can be used to infer the state of another person. The authors also found that the relationship between interoceptive accuracy and emotional awareness was not specific to any particular emotion, but rather general across all emotions.

**Results/Data**

The results of the study are based on fMRI data from 19 professional dancers and 23 non-dancers. The participants were shown a series of videos that elicited different emotions. The fMRI data showed that there is increased activity in the insula for interoceptive awareness, which is the process of perceiving physiological sensations in one's own body. This was found to be associated with a higher level of emotional awareness.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The study has some limitations. First, it only looked at professional dancers and non-dancers. The authors suggest that this may not generalize to other populations, such as amateur dancers or people who are simply interested in dance. Second, the fMRI data were collected while participants were watching videos, which is a different situation than when they are performing dance. Third, the study only looked at the relationship between interoceptive accuracy and emotional awareness. The authors suggest that this may not be specific to any particular emotion, but rather general across all emotions.
