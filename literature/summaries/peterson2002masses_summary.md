Overview/Summary:
The paper by Bradley M. Peterson (2002) presents a progress report on a project to improve both the precision and accuracy of the masses of supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The goal is to obtain highly accurate masses for the growth of quasars over most of the history of the universe, as well as to understand the energy budgets in AGNs. The author suggests that reverberation-based black-hole masses are becoming increasingly important because they can be used to anchor scaling methods that allow estimation of the black-hole masses in higher-redshift and higher-luminosity AGNs. The current estimates of black-hole masses are anchored by nearly 40 AGNs whose supermassive black hole (SBH) masses have been estimated using emission-line reverberation methods, where the response time of the broad emission lines to continuum variations is taken as the light-travel time across the line-emitting region. The author describes some preliminary results on a project that aims to improve both the accuracy and precision of the existing reverberation data to obtain highly accurate masses for the growth of quasars over most of the history of the universe.

Key Contributions/Findings:
The paper presents three main goals in this investigation: (1) to minimize the formal errors in black-hole mass estimates, (2) to determine the best characterization of the black-hole mass, and (3) some preliminary results. The first goal is to improve both the accuracy and precision to which reverberation masses are known. The author suggests that a detailed knowledge of the masses of supermassive black holes in AGNs is an important element of our understanding of how the accretion process works in nature. Highly accurate (to 10% or so) masses are needed to understand the energy budgets in AGNs: how much of the energy is converted into radiation, how much appears in the form of kinetic energy in jets and winds, and how much (if any) is advected in the black hole itself? The author also notes that current estimates of black-hole masses are anchored by nearly 40 AGNs whose SBH masses have been estimated using emission-line reverberation methods. The second goal is to determine the best characterization of the black-hole mass, and the third goal is to provide some preliminary results on a project that aims to improve both the accuracy and precision of the existing reverberation data to obtain highly accurate masses for the growth of quasars over most of the history of the universe. The author also notes that the values of k for various trivial BLR models are k = 3 for an isothermal sphere or for a thin spherical shell of randomly inclined Keplerian orbits, and k = 2 / sin^2 i for a ring at inclination i.

Results/Data:
The result of such a scaling exercise is shown in Fig. 1, for which the author finds k = 9.57 ± 0.15. This weighted fit is dominated by Akn 120, NGC 5548, and NGC 7469, the three AGNs with the highest-precision virial products. The scatter of the AGNs around the M–σ relationship is about 0.5 dex; i.e., reverberation masses appear to be accurate to a factor of about three.

Limitations/Discussion:
The author suggests that the fact that the inferred value of k is in the expected range for simple models reassures us that our assumption that the M–σ relationships for active and quiescent galaxies are identical is probably not grossly in error. The paper does not discuss any limitations or future work, but it acknowledges funding from NASA grant NAG5-8397, National Science Foundation grant AST-0205964, and US-Israel Binational Science Foundation grant 1999336.

Methodology/Approach:
The author describes the project that aims to improve both the accuracy and precision of the existing reverberation data. The first goal is to improve both the accuracy and precision to which reverberation masses are known. The second goal is to determine the best characterization of the black-hole mass, and the third goal is to provide some preliminary results on a project that aims to improve both the accuracy and precision of the existing reverberation data to obtain highly accurate masses for the growth of quasars over most of the history of the universe. The author also notes that the fact that our inferred value of k is in the expected range for simple models reassures us that our assumption that the M–σ relationships for active and quiescent galaxies are identical is probably not grossly in error.

Overall, the paper provides a comprehensive summary of the project to improve both the accuracy and precision to which the masses of supermassive black holes in AGNs are known. The author also notes that the values of k for various trivial BLR models are k = 3 for an isothermal sphere or for a thin spherical shell of randomly inclined Keplerian orbits, and k = 2 / sin^2 i for a ring at inclination i. In the latter case, a typical inclination of i ≈ 27o would yield our present estimate of k. The fact that our inferred value of k is in the expected range for simple models reassures us that our assumption that the M–σ relationships for active and quiescent galaxies are identical is probably not grossly in error.
