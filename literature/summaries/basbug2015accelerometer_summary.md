**Overview/Summary**
The paper presents a novel approach for classifying human activities using an accelerometer based system. The authors propose a new method that uses variational inference to classify the activities of daily living. In this work, the authors first introduce the concept of activity classification and explain why it is important in many applications. Then they describe the related work on this topic. After that, the authors present their approach for classifying human activities using an accelerometer based system. The authors use a hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) to model the user's activities with persistence. They also propose a new inference method called variational inference which is used in the HDP to infer the activity of the users.
