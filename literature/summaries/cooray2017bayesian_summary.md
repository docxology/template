**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Bayesian Belief Updating of Spatiotemporal Models" by Cooray et al. (2016) is a work in the field of Bayesian inference and spatiotemporal modeling, which is an interdisciplinary area that has been gaining increasing attention in recent years. The authors propose a new approach to update the parameters of a spatiotemporal model in a sequential manner using the data from the past time windows. This paper provides a comprehensive summary of this work.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this paper are the development of a novel Bayesian belief updating method for the spatiotemporal models and its application to the neural mean ﬁelds. The authors propose a new approach to update the parameters of a spatiotemporal model in a sequential manner using the data from the past time windows. This work is an extension of the previous work (Cooray et al., 2017) where the authors proposed a variational Bayes formulation for the Bayesian belief updating of the neural mean ﬁelds. The new approach can be applied to any spatiotemporal models that are based on the linear parameter ﬁelds, which is a wide range of models including the classical Gaussian process (GP) and the more recent spatial-temporal model. The authors also apply their method to the neural mean ﬁelds with the time independent particular solution and the homogenous particular solution.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use a variational Bayes formulation for the Bayesian belief updating of the parameters in the spatiotemporal models. This is an extension of the previous work (Cooray et al., 2017) where the authors proposed a variational Bayes formulation for the Bayesian belief updating of the neural mean ﬁelds. The new approach can be applied to any spatiotemporal models that are based on the linear parameter ﬁelds, which is a wide range of models including the classical Gaussian process (GP) and the more recent spatial-temporal model.

**Results/Data**

The authors use a one dimensional heat equation with time dependent boundary conditions as an example. The authors give the full solution to this problem in the paper. They also apply their method to the neural mean ﬁelds with the time independent particular solution and the homogenous particular solution. This is an extension of the previous work (Cooray et al., 2017) where the authors proposed a variational Bayes formulation for the Bayesian belief updating of the neural mean ﬁelds.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The main limitation of this paper is that the authors only use one dimensional heat equation with time dependent boundary conditions as an example. The authors also mention some future work, such as applying the method to other spatiotemporal models and using a more complex prior distribution in the Bayesian belief updating. This could be done by extending the previous work (Cooray et al., 2017) where the authors proposed a variational Bayes formulation for the Bayesian belief updating of the neural mean ﬁelds.
