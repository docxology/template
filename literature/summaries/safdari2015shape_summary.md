**Overview/Summary**
The paper "On the shape of the free boundary of variational inequalities with gradient constraints" by M. Safdari is a study on the regularity and smoothness properties of the free boundary for variational inequalities, which are a class of problems that arise in the context of the theory of partial differential equations. The authors consider the problem of minimizing a convex functional $\mathcal{F}$ with gradient constraint $|\nabla u| \leq 1$ on a bounded domain $\Omega$. In this paper, the authors investigate the smoothness properties of the free boundary for the variational inequalities. They show that if the minimizer is sufficiently regular, then the free boundary is a $C^{\infty}$-hypersurface. The main result of the paper states that if the minimizer is in $W^{1,p}(\Omega)$ for some $p > 2$, then the free boundary is a $C^{\infty}$-hypersurface. They also show that this regularity property holds true for the case where $\mathcal{F}$ is the total p-variation of a function, and the gradient constraint is the same as in the variational inequality with the total 1-variation. The authors' main tool is to use the strong maximum principle, which states that if $w$ is a nonnegative solution of the Laplacian equation $\Delta w \geq -\eta$, then either $w = 0$ or $w > 0$. This paper is an extension of the previous work by A. Fiedman and G. Pozzi [5] who proved that if the minimizer is in $W^{1,p}(\Omega)$ for some $p > 2$, then the free boundary is a $C^{\infty}$-hypersurface, and this regularity property holds true for the case where $\mathcal{F}$ is the total p-variation of a function. The authors' main tool is to use the strong maximum principle, which states that if $w$ is a nonnegative solution of the Laplacian equation $\Delta w \geq -\eta$, then either $w = 0$ or $w > 0$.
