**Overview/Summary**

The paper "ABC3: Active Bayesian Causal Inference with Three Treatments" by Addanki et al. (2022) is a work in the area of causal inference that proposes an active approach to estimate the average treatment effect (ATE) for three treatments. The authors consider the case where the number of covariates is large, and the target population is not necessarily the same as the one used in the training data. They assume that the training data is a random sample from the target population, but the training data may be small compared to the size of the target population. In this paper, they propose an active method called ABC3 that can efficiently estimate the ATE for three treatments. The authors compare their proposed approach with existing methods and show that it is more efficient in terms of the number of samples required.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of the paper are: 1) proposing a new active method to estimate the ATE, called ABC3; and 2) showing that the proposed method can be more efficient than existing methods. The authors compare their proposed approach with existing methods in terms of the number of samples required.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors consider the case where the number of covariates is large, and the target population is not necessarily the same as the one used in the training data. They assume that the training data is a random sample from the target population, but the training data may be small compared to the size of the target population. In this paper, they propose an active method called ABC3 that can efficiently estimate the ATE for three treatments. The authors compare their proposed approach with existing methods in terms of the number of samples required.

**Results/Data**

The authors show that the proposed method is more efficient than existing methods by comparing it with the existing methods in terms of the number of samples required. They also provide the results on a synthetic data set and two real-world data sets, including IHDP and Boston. The first test data set is the IHDP dataset which measures the cognitive development of low-birth-weight and premature infants after intensive high-quality child care and home visits. It consists of 747 samples with 25 covariates describing the children and parents with simulated potential outcomes. The second test data set is the Boston dataset that measures the median house prices in the Boston area. It consists of 506 samples with 13 covariates. Following Addanki et al. (2022), we set Y0 = Y1 to simulate the null hypothesis circumstance (i.e., CATE(x) = 0,∀x). The third test data is the ACIC dataset that is the first test data of the Atlantic Causal Inference Conference 2019 Data Challenge data set. It consists of 500 samples with 22 covariates. We report the results for the other 7 test data sets on Appendix G.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors assume the condition ϵ∗(In) ≤ 2δ∗(In), where M = 1
n Σi, j k(xi,xj) and δ∗(In) = 1
n Σi∈In
k(x,i). The assumption is equivalent toM−2infIn
δ∗(In) being lower bounded by the straight line connecting (0,M) and (N,−M). The authors show that this assumption may not hold if the covariates are absolutely and relatively isolated. However, as shown in Section 5.5, this assumption holds for general data sets with a large margin.
