**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Many-Body Microhydrodynamics of Colloidal Particles" by L. Bocquet et al. (2018) investigates the hydrodynamic interactions between a large number of colloidal particles, with the aim to understand the collective dynamics in a suspension where the distance between the particles is much larger than their size. The authors use a simplified model for the interaction potential and focus on the case where the particles are non-Brownian (i.e., they do not diffuse significantly over the timescale of interest) and where the Reynolds number is small, which is the case for colloidal suspensions in water. They show that the hydrodynamic interactions can be approximated by a superposition of one-body solutions if the distance between the particles is large compared to their size. This allows them to use a simple method based on a pairwise summation of the mobility and propulsion matrices, which they call the "superposition" or "superposition" approximation. The authors also study the case where the interaction potential is not harmonic, but rather that of a squirmer (an axisymmetric particle with an arbitrary slip velocity on its surface) in a harmonic potential. They show that the hydrodynamic interactions can be approximated by a superposition of one-body solutions if the distance between the particles is large compared to their size.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors present the first numerical study of the many-body dynamics of a suspension of colloidal particles, where the distance between the particles is much larger than their size. The paper provides an analytical solution for the case of a harmonic interaction potential and also develops a simple method based on a pairwise summation of the mobility and propulsion matrices that can be used to study the collective dynamics in a dilute suspension. The authors use a simplified model where the interactions between the particles are not Brownian (i.e., they do not diffuse significantly over the timescale of interest) and where the Reynolds number is small, which is the case for colloidal suspensions in water. They show that the hydrodynamic interactions can be approximated by a superposition of one-body solutions if the distance between the particles is large compared to their size. This allows them to use a simple method based on a pairwise summation of the mobility and propulsion matrices, which they call the "superposition" or "superposition" approximation.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors' model for the interaction potential and the many-body dynamics is based on a number of simplifications, including the assumption that the particles are non-Brownian. The authors also assume that the Reynolds number is small, which is not always the case in practice. In addition, the authors do not discuss the possibility of particle diffusion over the timescale of interest. However, the authors' model can be used to study the collective dynamics in a suspension where the particles are non-Brownian and where the Reynolds number is small. The authors also do not discuss the possibility that the particles could have anisotropic interactions or that the interaction potential is not harmonic.
