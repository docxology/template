**Overview/Summary**

The Long Way to Deforestation is a technical report by Dolan and Mycroft (2017) that presents an algorithmic approach for inferring fusion strategies in the declarative type- and-elaboration system of Lumberjack, which is a tool for deforestation. The main contribution of this paper is the presentation of a formalization of the problem as a subtyping inference problem. The authors show that the relational interpretation of the fusion rules is compatible with the standard definition of contextual approximation and thus their transformation algorithm is sound.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this work are the following:
- A formalization of the problem of inferring fusion strategies in the declarative type- and-elaboration system as a subtyping inference problem.
- The presentation of the soundness theorem for the Lumberjack transformation algorithm, which is an algorithmic approach to deforestation. The authors show that the relational interpretation of the fusion rules is compatible with the standard definition of contextual approximation and thus their transformation algorithm is sound.

**Methodology/Approach**

The main methodological contribution of this work is the presentation of a formalization of the problem as a subtyping inference problem. The authors also present the soundness theorem for the Lumberjack transformation algorithm, which is an algorithmic approach to deforestation. The authors show that the relational interpretation of the fusion rules is compatible with the standard definition of contextual approximation and thus their transformation algorithm is sound.

**Results/Data**

The main results of this work are the following:
- A formalization of the problem as a subtyping inference problem.
- The presentation of the soundness theorem for the Lumberjack transformation algorithm, which is an algorithmic approach to deforestation. The authors show that the relational interpretation of the fusion rules is compatible with the standard definition of contextual approximation and thus their transformation algorithm is sound.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The main limitations of this work are the following:
- This paper only presents a formalization of the problem as a subtyping inference problem.
- The presentation of the soundness theorem for the Lumberjack transformation algorithm, which is an algorithmic approach to deforestation. The authors show that the relational interpretation of the fusion rules is compatible with the standard definition of contextual approximation and thus their transformation algorithm is sound.
