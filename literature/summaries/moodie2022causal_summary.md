**Overview/Summary**

The paper provides a review of recent and future developments in causal inference, with a focus on statistical methods for drawing conclusions about cause-and-effect relationships from observational data. The authors highlight the importance of this area of research, as many studies are observational rather than experimental, and thus may be subject to confounding by unmeasured variables. They provide an overview of the current state-of-the-art in causal inference, including a discussion of the key assumptions required for statistical analyses (unconfoundedness, exchangeability, and consistency), and then discuss several recent advances that weaken or relax these assumptions. The authors also describe some new data structures that have arisen with the increase in digital storage capacity and computational power.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this paper are a review of the current state-of-the-art in causal inference, as well as an overview of several recent advances that weaken or relax these assumptions. The authors also describe some new data structures that have arisen with the increase in digital storage capacity and computational power.

**Methodology/Approach**

The approach taken by the paper is a review of the current state-of-the-art in causal inference, including a discussion of the key assumptions required for statistical analyses (unconfoundedness, exchangeability, and consistency), as well as an overview of several recent advances that weaken or relax these assumptions. The authors also describe some new data structures that have arisen with the increase in digital storage capacity and computational power.

**Results/Data**

The main results are a review of the current state-of-the-art in causal inference, including a discussion of the key assumptions required for statistical analyses (unconfoundedness, exchangeability, and consistency), as well as an overview of several recent advances that weaken or relax these assumptions. The authors also describe some new data structures that have arisen with the increase in digital storage capacity and computational power.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The main limitations are the lack of a unified theory for causal inference, and the need to consider the possibility of unmeasured confounding. The authors suggest that the recent advances provide a framework for future research on these issues, but also note that there is no single approach that will solve all problems.
