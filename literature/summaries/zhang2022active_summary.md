**Overview/Summary**

This paper proposes a new concept of active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to overcome the fundamental limitation of "multiplicative fading" in traditional RISs and explores its potential applications in wireless communication systems. The authors first verify the signal model of an active RIS through experimental measurements on a fabricated active RIS element, then formulate the sum-rate maximization problem for an active RIS aided multiple-input single-output (MISO) system and propose a joint precoding and beamforming algorithm to solve this problem. Finally, they develop a wireless communication prototype aided by a 64-element active RIS and validate the potential of active RISs through field tests.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors show that existing passive RIS can only realize a negligible sum-rate gain of about 3%, while the proposed active RIS can achieve a substantial sum-rate gain of about 62%. The paper's main contributions are: (1) the concept of an active RIS to overcome the "multiplicative fading" effect in traditional RISs, and (2) the experimental validation of the signal model of the active RIS through the measurement on the fabricated active RIS element. The proposed algorithm is a joint precoding and beamforming approach that can be used for both downlink and uplink transmissions.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors first verify the signal model of an active RIS by measuring the reflection coefficient of a fabricated active RIS element, which is a crucial step in the development of active RIS. The proposed algorithm is a joint precoding and beamforming approach that can be used for both downlink and uplink transmissions. The key idea of this paper is to overcome the "multiplicative fading" effect by using an active RIS instead of a passive one, which is not possible in traditional RISs. The authors use the experimental results on the fabricated active RIS element to demonstrate the potential of the proposed algorithm.

**Results/Data**

The signal model of the active RIS is verified through the measurement on the fabricated active RIS element. The authors also develop a wireless communication prototype aided by an 64-element active RIS and validate the potential of active RISs through field tests. The experimental results show that the data rate for the active RIS can hold at about 30 Mbps, while that for the metal plate only ranges from 1 Mbps to 2Mbps.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The paper's main weakness is that it does not consider the hardware design and prototype development of an active RIS. The authors also do not discuss the channel estimation problem in detail. In addition, the energy efficiency analysis for the proposed algorithm is not provided. These are important research directions for future work.

Title: Active RISs: Signal Modeling, Asymptotic Analysis, and Performance Evaluation

Abstract:

The paper proposes the concept of active reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) to overcome the fundamental limitation of the "multiplicative fading" effect in traditional RISs. The authors first verify the signal model of an active RIS through experimental measurements on a fabricated active RIS element, then formulate the sum-rate maximization problem for an active RIS aided multiple-input single-output (MISO) system and propose a joint precoding and beamforming algorithm to solve this problem. Finally, they develop a wireless communication prototype aided by a 64-element active RIS and validate the potential of active RISs through field tests.

I. INTRODUCTION

The authors' main contributions are: (1) the concept of an active RIS to overcome the "multiplicative fading" effect in traditional RISs, and (2) the experimental validation of the signal model of the active RIS through the measurement on the fabricated active RIS element. The proposed algorithm is a joint precoding and beamforming approach that can be used for both downlink and uplink transmissions.

II. ACTIVE RIS VS. PASSIVE RIS

The authors show that existing passive RIS can only realize a negligible sum-rate gain of about 3%, while the proposed active RIS can achieve a substantial sum-rate gain of about 62%. The paper's main contributions are: (1) the concept of an active RIS to overcome the "multiplicative fading" effect in traditional RISs, and (2) the experimental validation of the signal model of the active RIS through the measurement on the fabricated active RIS element. The proposed algorithm is a joint precoding and beamforming approach that can be used for both downlink and uplink transmissions.

III. SIGNAL MODEL OF THE ACTIVE RIS

The authors first verify the signal model of an active RIS by measuring the reflection coefficient of a fabricated active RIS element, which is a crucial step in the development of active RIS. The proposed algorithm is a joint precoding and beamforming approach that can be used for both downlink and uplink transmissions.

IV. PROPOSED ALGORITHM

The authors propose a joint precoding and beamforming approach to solve the formulated sum-rate maximization problem. The key idea of this paper is to overcome the "multiplicative fading" effect by using an active RIS instead of a passive one, which is not possible in traditional RISs.

V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

The signal model of the active RIS is veriﬁed through the measurement on the fabricated active RIS element. The authors also develop a wireless communication prototype aided by an 64-element active RIS and validate the potential of active RISs through field tests. The experimental results show that the data rate for the active RIS can hold at about 30 Mbps, while that for the metal plate only ranges from 1 Mbps to 2Mbps.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, the authors have studied the concept of active RISs to overcome the fundamental limitation of the "multiplicative fading" effect. Firstly, the authors have veriﬁed the signal model of an active RIS through the experimental measurements on a fabricated active RIS element. Based on the veriﬁed signal model, the authors have formulated the sum-rate maximization problem for an active RIS aided MU- MISO system and a joint precoding and beamforming algorithm has been proposed to solve this problem. Simulation results have shown that, in a typical application scenario, the existing passive RIS can realize only a negligible sum-rate gain of about 3%, while the active RIS can achieve a substantial sum-rate gain of about 62%, thus indeed overcoming the "multiplicative fading" effect. Finally, the authors have developed a communication wireless communication prototype aided by a 64-element active RIS, and the signiﬁcant gain of active RISs is validated by ﬁeld test.
