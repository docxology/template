**Overview/Summary**

The free energy principle (FEP) is a theoretical framework for understanding the behavior of complex systems in terms of their internal and external states. The authors present some interesting observations on the FEP by discussing its relationship with other concepts from information geometry, thermodynamics, and statistical mechanics. They also discuss how the FEP can be applied to understand the behavior of living organisms. The paper is organized as follows: First, they introduce the basic concept of the FEP, which is a variational principle that characterizes the stationary states of physical systems. Next, they present some observations on the FEP from the perspectives of information geometry and statistical mechanics. Then, the authors discuss how the FEP can be applied to understand the behavior of living organisms.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this paper are the following: The authors show that the FEP is a variational principle that characterizes the stationary states of physical systems. They also present some observations on the FEP from the perspectives of information geometry and statistical mechanics. Finally, they discuss how the FEP can be applied to understand the behavior of living organisms.
