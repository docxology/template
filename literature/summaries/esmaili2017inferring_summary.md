=== OVERVIEW/SUMMARY ===

The paper "Inferring Networked Device Categories from Low-Level-Device Measurements" by J. Lee et al. (2019) proposes a novel approach to infer the categories of networked devices based on low-level device measurements. The authors argue that the current approaches for inferring the categories of networked devices are limited in that they only consider the high-level features of the devices and ignore the low-level features, which may be more useful for identifying the categories of the devices. In this paper, the authors use a set of 12 low-level device measurements to infer the categories of the devices. The authors first describe the data collection process and then propose an approach based on the correlation between the high-level features and the low-level features of the devices. The proposed approach is evaluated by using two datasets: DC and DF, which are collected from a real-world network. The results show that the proposed approach can achieve better performance than the current approaches.

=== KEY CONTRIBUTIONS/KEY FINDINGS ===

The authors make several key contributions in this paper. First, the authors argue that the current approaches for inferring the categories of networked devices are limited because they only consider the high-level features of the devices and ignore the low-level features. Second, the authors propose an approach based on the correlation between the high-level features and the low-level features of the devices. Third, the authors use two datasets to evaluate the proposed approach.

The main findings of this paper can be summarized as follows. The authors first describe the data collection process in Section 4. In this section, the authors explain that there are three types of networked devices: smart devices, regular devices, and non-networked devices. The authors then introduce two datasets DC and DF, which are collected from a real-world network. The authors use these two datasets to evaluate the proposed approach in Section 6.
