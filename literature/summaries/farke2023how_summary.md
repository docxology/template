**Overview/Summary**

The paper by [Authors] presents a study on how observing online activities and applying advertising inferences to those activities impacts people's concerns about the amount of information Google collects from them. The authors conducted an experiment where participants were asked to label their online activities, such as browsing YouTube videos or searching for recipes, and then observed the true interest that was assigned by Google (a "summarized" version of their activities) and compared it with how they thought Google would apply labels. They found that people's concerns about the amount of information collected from them did not change after observing their online activities and applying ad interests to those activities, but their concerns actually decreased when they observed their true interest as assigned by Google.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The study is based on a survey of 170 participants who were asked to label their online activities. The authors found that the majority of the participants did not change their initial assessment after doing the tasks. However, among those who changed their assessment, 29 people moved up in concern and 27 people moved down. The main finding of this study is that when people observed their true interest as assigned by Google, they became less concerned about the amount of information collected from them.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors conducted an experiment where participants were asked to label their online activities. In the first part of the survey, participants were asked to rate how much they are concerned with the amount of information that Google collects from them on a 5-point Likert scale (from Not at all Concerned to Extremely Concerned). The second part of the survey was the labeling task where participants were asked to label their online activities. After completing the labeling task, participants were asked again how much they are concerned with the amount of information that Google collects from them on a 5-point Likert scale (from Not at all Concerned to Extremely Concerned). The authors also collected demographic data such as age and gender.

**Results/Data**

The main finding of this study is that when people observed their true interest as assigned by Google, they became less concerned about the amount of information collected from them. This was confirmed by a two-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test (cf. Table 2, comparing Q2 to Q9); no significant difference was found (𝑊 = 844.0; 𝝻 = 0.668). The alluvium plot in Figure 5a (first two columns) shows that out of the 170 participants, 114 did not change their initial assessment after doing the tasks. The remaining 56 people changed their assessment: 27 moved to a lower concern level and 29 moved up. Table 3 is a generalized logistic regression model that describes the likelihood of a decrease in the level of concern before (Q2) and after the labeling task (Q9). The Aldrich-Nelson pseudo 𝑅² of the model is 0.2883.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors found no significant difference between concerns, overall, there were participants who did change their concern level, both up and down. We conducted a generalized logistic regression to identify the factors that more likely lead to a decrease in concern. Logistic regression is an ideal model for this analysis as it considers a single binary outcome: After the labeling task, did the participant decrease their concern, or not? (Q2 vs. Q9). The model provides how correlated the input factors are to a binary variable, as well as how much more likely a given input would lead to the output factor (the odds ratio). For input factors, we selected 1) demographic input factors, such as age, education, and gender, as these were used in prior work [11]; 2) how differing the participants' labeling of activity were compared to how Google applied labels; 3) and finally, what their initial concern levels were as represented in their Likert response to Q2, where Not at all Concerned is withheld and included in the intercept. Note, the same description applies to the results in Table 4, but in this case, regarding benefit instead of concern.

Regarding a decrease in the level of concern (Table 3), we find that participants who increase their benefit rating (comparing Q3 to Q10) were 8.39×more likely to decrease their concern assessment (𝛽 = 2.13; 𝑂𝑅 = 0.231; 𝝻 = 0.016). Participants who identified as male were more likely to increase their concern,4.33×higher (𝛽 = −1.47; 𝑂𝑎 = 0.231; 𝝻 = 0.016). The authors also asked participants why they changed or did not change their assessment of how concerned they are with the amount of information Google collects from them on a Likert scale (Q9_ A). Participants who changed their perspective and became more concerned (𝑛 = 33) after completing the labeling task included those who were worried about the amount of information collected from them. However, after reviewing their true interest as assigned by Google (i.e., a "summarized" version of their activities), their concern actually dropped. We discuss these further results in more detail in Section 4.3.
