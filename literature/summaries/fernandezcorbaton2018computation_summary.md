**Overview/Summary**

The present work is concerned with the electromagnetic properties of molecular ensembles. The authors investigate the computation of these properties in the framework of the T-matrix approach for a system consisting of an arbitrary number of identical molecules. In this paper, the authors consider the case where all the molecules are located at the same point and the case where they are distributed randomly on the surface of a sphere. They also study the effect of the nonlocality of the interaction between the molecules in the first case. The T-matrix is calculated for the two cases and the results are compared with each other. In this paper, the authors consider the case where all the molecules are located at the same point and the case where they are distributed randomly on the surface of a sphere. They also study the effect of the nonlocality of the interaction between the molecules in the first case. The T-matrix is calculated for the two cases and the results are compared with each other.
