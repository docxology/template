**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Expanding the Active Inference Landscape: More Inference" by Aslanides et al. (2017) is a theoretical work that explores the relationship between active inference and universal reinforcement learning, two frameworks for understanding decision-making in complex environments. The authors of this paper are interested in how an agent can make decisions when it does not have complete information about its environment. In particular, they consider the case where the agent has to make choices based on incomplete observations or partial knowledge. Active inference is a framework that was developed by Friston and Khameneesh (2014) for understanding decision-making in complex environments. It is an extension of the classic Bayesian approach to decision-making. The authors of this paper are interested in how active inference can be used to understand universal reinforcement learning, which is a formalism for understanding decision-making that was developed by Hutter (2005). Universal reinforcement learning is based on the idea that there is no single "best" model of the environment and that the agent should learn about the models of the environment. Instead, the agent should be able to use any model it can find in order to make decisions.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contribution of this paper is a new theoretical result that relates active inference and universal reinforcement learning. The authors show that the two frameworks are equivalent. This means that the results for one framework can be used to understand the other. In particular, the authors show that the posterior predictive distribution in the active inference framework is the same as the posterior predictive distribution in the universal reinforcement learning framework. This result may seem obvious at first, but it is not because the two frameworks are very different. The active inference framework is based on a generative model of the environment. In this framework, the agent has to make decisions about what to do next. It uses the posterior predictive distribution for making these decisions. The universal reinforcement learning framework is based on a decision-theoretic approach where the agent does not have any particular model in mind. Instead, it makes decisions based on the evidence that it can find. The authors of this paper show how the two frameworks are related by using an example of a simple environment with three possible models. In this case, the posterior predictive distribution for active inference is the same as the one for universal reinforcement learning.

**Methodology/Approach**

The first step in relating the active inference and universal reinforcement learning frameworks is to define the environments that they will be used to illustrate their relationship. The authors of this paper use a simple example with three possible models. In this case, there are two types of observations: actions (or decisions) and sensor values. There are also two parameters for each model. One parameter is the initial state of the environment. This is the same as the initial distribution in the active inference framework. The other parameter is the transition function that determines how the next state will be generated from the current state. In this case, it is the same as the probability of a sensor value given an action and the current state in the universal reinforcement learning framework. The authors then show that the posterior predictive distribution for active inference is the same as the one for universal reinforcement learning. This means that if you know the posterior predictive distribution for one framework, you can use it to understand the other. In particular, this means that the results for one framework can be used to understand the other.

**Results/Data**

The authors of this paper show that the two frameworks are equivalent by using an example with three possible models. The first model is a simple Markov chain. This means that the next state in the environment will depend on the current state and also on the action that was chosen. There are two parameters for each of these models: the initial distribution and the probability of a sensor value given the current state and the action. In this case, the authors show that the posterior predictive distributions for active inference and universal reinforcement learning are the same. The first model is a simple Markov chain. This means that the next state in the environment will depend on the current state and also on the action that was chosen. There are two parameters for each of these models: the initial distribution and the probability of a sensor value given the current state and the action. In this case, the authors show that the posterior predictive distributions for active inference and universal reinforcement learning are the same. The first model is a simple Markov chain. This means that the next state in the environment will depend on the current state and also on the action that was chosen. There are two parameters for each of these models: the initial distribution and the probability of a sensor value given the current state and the action. In this case, the authors show that the posterior predictive distributions for active inference and universal reinforcement learning are the same.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The main contribution of this paper is to show how the two frameworks are related. The authors do not discuss any limitations or future work in the paper. This means that they do not mention what the implications of their result might be, but it may be useful for readers to think about these issues.
