**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Deep Active Inference Agents for Delayed and Long-Term Exploration" introduces a new class of agents that can be used to address the problem of delayed and long-term exploration in partially observable stochastic domains. The authors begin by discussing the challenges associated with this problem, including the fact that current methods are not able to balance the trade-off between exploration and exploitation well enough. They also point out that existing methods do not scale well as the number of states increases. The authors then introduce their new approach, which they call "Deep Active Inference Agents" (DAIA). DAIA is a hybrid inference-exploration agent that can be used to balance the trade-off between exploration and exploitation in partially observable stochastic domains. The authors also discuss how this method can be used to address the problem of delayed and long-term exploration.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of the paper are the introduction of DAIA, a new class of agents that can be used to balance the trade-off between exploration and exploitation in partially observable stochastic domains. The authors also show how this method can be used to address the problem of delayed and long-term exploration.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors begin by discussing the challenges associated with the problem of delayed and long-term exploration, including the fact that current methods are not able to balance the trade-off between exploration and exploitation well enough. The authors then introduce their new approach, which they call "Deep Active Inference Agents" (DAIA). DAIA is a hybrid inference-exploration agent that can be used to balance the trade-off between exploration and exploitation in partially observable stochastic domains. The authors also discuss how this method can be used to address the problem of delayed and long-term exploration.

**Results/Data**

The authors show that their new approach, DAIA, can be used to improve the performance of existing methods. They compare the performance of DAIA with a number of other approaches on a variety of different problems. The authors also discuss how this method can be used to address the problem of delayed and long-term exploration.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The main challenges associated with the problem of delayed and long-term exploration are that current methods do not scale well as the number of states increases, and that they are not able to balance the trade-off between exploration and exploitation well enough. The authors also discuss how this method can be used to address the problem of delayed and long-term exploration.
