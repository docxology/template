**Overview/Summary**

The paper reviews various network inference techniques for inferring neural activation from population calcium imaging data. The authors discuss the advantages and limitations of different methods that have been proposed in the literature to date and compare their performance on a common dataset. They also propose an approach based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that can learn to predict correlation statistics from the data, which is not possible with other approaches.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The paper reviews the following network inference techniques: 1) cross-correlation analysis, 2) Bayesian inference of functional connectivity and network structure, 3) maximum likelihood estimation of cascade point-process neural encoding models, 4) OOPSI (Optimal Optical Spike Inference), 5) Sutera et al.'s method for simple connectome inference from partial correlation statistics. The authors compare the performance of these methods on a common dataset and show that their approach using CNNs is better than other approaches.
