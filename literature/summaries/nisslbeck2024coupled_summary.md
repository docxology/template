**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Coupled autoregressive active inference agents for control" by Kouw et al. [1] presents a new approach to the problem of learning policies in continuous control tasks using the free energy principle, which is based on the variational autoencoder (VAE) and the transition model (TM). The authors introduce a new class of coupled autoregressive active inference agents that are able to learn both the policy and the dynamics of the environment. In this paper, the authors first present the VAE-TM framework for learning policies in continuous control tasks from observations. They then show how to extend the VAE-TM to the case where the agent can only observe the current state of the environment, but not its future states. The authors also introduce a new class of coupled autoregressive active inference agents that are able to learn both the policy and the dynamics of the environment.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this paper are the introduction of the VAE-TM framework for learning policies in continuous control tasks from observations, and the extension of the VAE-TM to the case where the agent can only observe the current state of the environment. The authors also introduce a new class of coupled autoregressive active inference agents that are able to learn both the policy and the dynamics of the environment. These contributions represent advances in the field of learning policies using the free energy principle, which is based on the variational autoencoder (VAE) and the transition model (TM). The authors also present a new class of coupled autoregressive active inference agents that are able to learn both the policy and the dynamics of the environment.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The main limitation of this paper is that it does not provide a comparison with other approaches for continuous control tasks. The authors also do not discuss the potential applications of the new class of coupled autoregressive active inference agents in the field of learning policies using the free energy principle, which is based on the VAE and the TM.
