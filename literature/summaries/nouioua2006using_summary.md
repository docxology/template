Overview/Summary:
The paper "Using Answer Set Programming in an Inference-Based Reasoning" by Kayser and Nouioua presents a novel approach to the problem of natural language (NL) semantics that is based on the idea that inferences are at the heart of the problematic of NL understanding. The authors propose a general representation language which takes into account within a first-order framework modalities, time and non-monotonicity that are essential aspects in an inferential approach to NL understanding. The paper also presents how to transform these inference rules into extended logic programs. To illustrate their approach in a practical domain they have used a corpus of 60 short texts describing the circumstances of road accidents. The authors' validation criterion is that the system gives for each text the same answer as the predetermined one. The running time varies from a text to another but it does not exceed 30 seconds which is rather encouraging.

Key Contributions/Findings:
The paper defends the idea that inferences are at the heart of the problematic of NL semantics. The authors show that the inferences they need to understand natural language are based on our knowledge about the norms of the domain and are non-monotonic since the conclusions of this kind of reasoning are in general defeasible. They proposed a general representation language which takes into account within a first-order framework modalities, time and non-monotonicity that are essential aspects in an inferential approach to NL understanding. The paper also presents how to transform their inference rules into extended logic programs. To illustrate their approach in a practical domain they have used a corpus of 60 short texts describing the circumstances of road accidents. They have determined manually for each text the answer that they hope to obtain. Thus, the validation criterion is that the system gives for each text the same answer as the predetermined one. The running time varies from a text to another but it does not exceed 30 seconds which is rather encouraging.

Methodology/Approach:
The authors have used a corpus of 60 short texts describing the circumstances of road accidents. They have determined manually for each text the answer that they hope to obtain. Thus, the validation criterion is that the system gives for each text the same answer as the predetermined one. The running time varies from a text to another but it does not exceed 30 seconds which is rather encouraging.

Results/Data:
The authors' validation criterion is that the system gives for each text the same answer as the predetermined one. The running time varies from a text to another but it does not exceed 30 seconds which is rather encouraging.

Limitations/Discussion:
Many other perspectives of future work are open, among them: • Analyzing more texts of the same domain in order to verify that the validation criterion is met for all the texts; • Generalizing the approach to other domains.
