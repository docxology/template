**Overview/Summary**

The paper presents a novel approach to understanding the neural correlates of affective processes in humans by using a combination of machine learning and neuroimaging techniques. The authors propose an active inference framework that can be used to infer the state of the brain from the observation of the dual-brain signals, which are obtained through the sliding window analysis of the EEG data. In this paper, the authors first describe the affective rupture and repair process in the inter-brain network as a topological phase transition. The authors then propose an active inference framework that can be used to infer the state of the brain from the observation of the dual-brain signals. The authors also present the algorithmic skeleton for the curvature-entropy driven inference cycle, which is based on the idea that the high entropy of the FRc distribution (HFRc) indicates the topological phase transition in the inter-brain network and the low HFRc reinforces the attuned policies. The paper provides a comprehensive summary of the key contributions and findings.
