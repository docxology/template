**Overview/Summary**
The paper presents an active digital twin (ADT) framework for partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs), which is a mathematical model of the physical-digital system interaction problem. The ADT is a generative process that can be used to predict the behavior of the physical space, and it also provides a mechanism for the AIF agent to make decisions in the digital space. The ADT is based on active inference (AIF), which is an information-theoretic approach to decision-making that is grounded in the principles of Bayesian inference. The paper presents a new methodology for the ADT problem, and it demonstrates how the AIF generative models can be used to navigate the POMDP underlying the digital twin problem.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The main contributions of this work are:
1) An active digital twin (ADT) framework is presented for partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs), which is a mathematical model of the physical-digital system interaction problem. The ADT is a generative process that can be used to predict the behavior of the physical space, and it also provides a mechanism for the AIF agent to make decisions in the digital space.
2) An active inference (AIF) generative model is presented for the POMDP underlying the ADT problem. The AIF generative models are based on Bayesian inference, which is an information-theoretic approach to decision-making that is grounded in the principles of probability theory and statistical estimation. The AIF agent can make decisions by using the expected free energy (EFE) as a performance measure.
3) The EFE associated with a generic policy π is defined as: Gπ  EQ(Ot, Dtc|π)  ln Q(Dtc|π) − ln ep(Ot), where ep(Ot) is a generative model biased by the predictive prior over observationep(Ot). This construction integrates the prior preferences encoded in c into the inference process. The AIF agent can act in ways that maximize the likelihood of preferred outcomes.

**Results/Data**
The use of AIF generative models for digital state inference and policy inference is graphically summarized in Fig. 4. Digital state inference integrates the prior belief at time t − 1 with the observational data assimilated at t. In contrast, policy inference entails predictive modeling over the horizon t = t,  ,  , tp, where the generative model operates without access to future sensory data or executed actions from the interfacing generative process.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The paper does not discuss the limitations of its methodology and findings. The authors could have discussed the following issues: 
1) The AIF framework is based on Bayesian inference, which assumes that all relevant information has been incorporated into the prior distribution. However, in real-world problems, it may be difficult to specify a complete set of possible observations and actions for the POMDP. It would be important to discuss how the authors could handle this issue.
2) The AIF framework is based on the assumption that the generative model can provide accurate predictions for all the possible observations. However, in real-world problems, it may not be easy to specify a complete set of possible observations and actions for the POMDP. It would be important to discuss how the authors could handle this issue.
