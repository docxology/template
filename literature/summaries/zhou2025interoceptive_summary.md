=== OVERVIEW ===

The paper introduces a new shared control architecture for robots to enhance their autonomy and adaptability in co-constructive task hierarchies under human supervision. The proposed framework is called the interoceptive robot (IR) that enables the robotic agent to reflect on its internal cognitive dissonance, which arises from the discrepancies between its self-belief in the decision space and the final actions convergent with human input. This interoception supports the agent's ability to scaffold its learning by reflecting on contextualized rationale derived from human semantic feedback and thus adaptively recalibrate its motion planning to accommodate future similar environmental conditions. The interoceptive robot is a fresh perspective for advancing robotized construction automation from rigid, pre-programmed behaviors to greater autonomy and adaptive intelligence. By learning from human counterparts in co-constructive task hierarchies and under human supervision, it supports more heterogeneous and complex tasks within the modular construction vision, contributing to decarbonized and safer construction initiatives.

=== KEY CONTRIBUTIONS/FINDINGS ===

The main contributions of this paper are:
1) The interoceptive robot (IR) is designed to enhance the autonomy and adaptability of robotic agents by incorporating an internal belief system and a conflict-tracking mechanism within a new shared control architecture. This interoception supports the agent's ability to scaffold its learning by reflecting on contextualized rationale derived from human semantic feedback and thus adaptively recalibrate its motion planning to accommodate future similar environmental conditions.
2) The proposed framework offers a fresh perspective for advancing robotized construction automation from rigid, pre-programmed behaviors to greater autonomy and adaptive intelligence.

=== METHODOLOGY/APPROACH ===

The interoceptive robot is designed based on a new shared control architecture. The proposed framework enables the robotic agent to reflect on its internal cognitive dissonance that arises from the discrepancies between its self-belief in the decision space and the final actions convergent with human input. This interoception supports the agent's ability to scaffold its learning by reflecting on contextualized rationale derived from human semantic feedback and thus adaptively recalibrate its motion planning to accommodate future similar environmental conditions.

=== RESULTS/DATA ===

The proposed framework is demonstrated in a UR 10 bin stacking application containing a conveyor belt, a pallet where the bins should be stacked, and a UR 10 robot with a suction gripper. Bins arriving right-shoulder were flipped at a designated station to ensure proper stacking upside down. The placement alternated between sides of the pallet to balance weights. A supplementary video demonstrating the robot's motion planning is available at https://youtu.be/yHbuoG7d05A.

=== LIMITATIONS/DISCUSSION ===

Future work will further integrate sensors for weight tracking to enhance the motion planning of the manipulator, maintaining a balanced load while minimizing energy consumption and time during operation. In addition, sim-to-real discrepancies will be studied and minimized by analyzing the correlation between stiffness and damping parameters in the simulation setup (after importing robot models from URDF formats) and the variability of loads and terrain features that influence friction in the real-world.
