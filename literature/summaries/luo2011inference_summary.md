**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Inference with interference between units in an fMRI" by [Authors] is a statistical analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from the Brain Research Foundation's (BRF) database, which was collected to study motor response inhibition. The authors are interested in testing whether there is any inference between brain regions that can be used to understand how the brain works and what it might mean for the development of statistical methods. In this paper, they use a randomization test to analyze the data from 32 participants who performed a stop-signal task while undergoing fMRI scans.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors find that there is an increase in activity in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) when comparing successful stop trials to failed stop trials. The point estimate of this effect for unfiltered STN data with k 5 is a 29.5% increase above chance, and the 95% confidence interval is 0.259. In addition to the subthalamic nucleus, other regions of the brain are suspected to be involved in motor response inhibition, including the right inferior frontal cortex (or rIFC) and the presupplementary motor area (or preSMA). The authors find that there is an increase in activity in both the rIFC and the preSMA when comparing successful stop trials to failed stop trials. Using 5 as the number of controls, the point estimate for unfiltered STN data is a 29.5% increase above chance, and the 95% confidence interval is 0.259.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use a randomization test to analyze the data from 32 participants who performed a stop-signal task while undergoing fMRI scans.
