**Overview/Summary**

The paper presents a novel approach to online class imbalance learning by combining data augmentation on-the-ﬂy with active learning for improving the performance of deep neural networks in imbalanced datasets. The authors propose an algorithm called ALDA, which is a hybrid method that combines the advantages of both data augmentation and active learning. The proposed algorithm can be used in any dataset where class imbalance exists. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: (1) it proposes to use data augmentation on-the-ﬂy for online learning; (2) it introduces an adaptive sampling strategy for selecting the most informative samples from the unlabeled pool, and (3) it shows that ALDA can be used in any dataset where class imbalance exists. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on several benchmark datasets with different class imbalance ratios.
