**Overview/Summary**
The paper investigates a novel multi-pair device-to-device (D2D) communication system aided by an active intelligent surface (RIS). The authors first analyze the performance of the RIS-aided D2D network when the RIS is equipped with perfect statistical channel state information (CSI), and then consider the case where the RIS has imperfect CSI. In both cases, the RIS can be reconfigured to optimize the system's performance. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The authors first analyze the performance of a multi-pair D2D network when the RIS is equipped with perfect statistical CSI. They show that the sum rate of the RIS-aided MIMO multiple-access channel over spatially correlated Rician fading is achieved by the maximum ratio combining (MRC) scheme, and derive an asymptotic expression for the achievable sum rate in the high signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) regime. The authors then consider the case where the RIS has imperfect CSI. They show that the outage probability of the RIS-aided MIMO multiple-access channel over spatially correlated Rician fading is achieved by the maximum ratio combining (MRC) scheme, and derive an asymptotic expression for the achievable sum rate in the high SNR regime. The authors also analyze the performance of a multi-pair D2D network when the RIS has statistical CSI. They show that the outage probability of the RIS-aided MIMO multiple-access channel over spatially correlated Rician fading is achieved by the maximum ratio combining (MRC) scheme, and derive an asymptotic expression for the achievable sum rate in the high SNR regime.
