**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Solar activity forcing of terrestrial hydrological phenomena" by Mauas et al. (2011) is a study that investigates the relationship between solar activity and the Earth's surface temperature and precipitation patterns, with a focus on the role of the 11-year solar cycle in modulating these phenomena. The authors use data from the past 300 years to examine the long-term variability of the terrestrial hydrological phenomena, which include the global mean temperature, the global mean precipitation, and the Indian summer monsoon rainfall. They find that the 11-year solar cycle has a significant impact on the Earth's surface temperature and the Indian summer monsoon rainfall, but not on the global mean precipitation. The authors also examine the role of the 22-year Hale cycle in modulating the terrestrial hydrological phenomena.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main findings of this study are that the 11-year solar cycle has a significant impact on the Earth's surface temperature and the Indian summer monsoon rainfall, but not on the global mean precipitation. The authors find that the 22-year Hale cycle also plays an important role in modulating the terrestrial hydrological phenomena. The study is based on the analysis of the data from the past 300 years.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use a variety of different datasets to analyze the long-term variability of the Earth's surface temperature and precipitation patterns, including the global mean temperature (GMT) and the global mean precipitation (GMP), as well as the Indian summer monsoon rainfall. The GMT is obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) data set, which contains the average annual temperatures for the past 300 years. The GMP is obtained from the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP). The Indian summer monsoon rainfall is obtained from the tree-ring records. The authors use a variety of different statistical methods to analyze the long-term variability of these phenomena.

**Results/Data**

The study finds that the 11-year solar cycle has a significant impact on the GMT and the Indian summer monsoon rainfall, but not on the GMP. The authors find that the 22-year Hale cycle also plays an important role in modulating the terrestrial hydrological phenomena. The authors use a variety of different statistical methods to analyze the long-term variability of these phenomena.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The study is based only on the analysis of the data from the past 300 years, and it does not examine the relationship between the solar activity and the terrestrial hydrological phenomena in the past. The authors do not discuss the possibility that there may be a different relationship between the solar activity and the terrestrial hydrological phenomena in the future.
