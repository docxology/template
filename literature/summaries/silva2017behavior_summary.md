**Overview/Summary**
The study of the solar magnetic field dynamics is very important to understand the phenomena which may affect the Earth environment. These dynamics have been daily monitored since the years ∼ 1600 by the number of sunspots (SSN). Another classical index used to measure the solar activity is the radio flux at 10.7 cm (F10.7), which is generated at coronal heights and related to the presence of active regions and the occurrence of flares. The relationship between these indexes, that used to be linear, was destroyed in the last two cycles, which presented a SSN smaller than the expected by the measured F10.7 flux (Livingston et al. 2012). Selhorst et al.(2014) studied the number of active regions observed by the NoRH (Nobeyama Radioheliograph) at 17 GHz between the years 1992 and 2013. During the quiet solar period between 2008 and 2009, they reported the presence of active regions during days without sunspots (about 33% of active days in the period). This fact was addressed to regions with magnetic field intensity less than 1500 G (Livingston et al. 2012). In this work, we investigated the physical parameters of the spotless active regions observed during solar minimum period between 2007 and 2010.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The results show that the spotless active regions present the same radio characteristics as an ordinary one, they can live in the solar surface for long periods ( > 10 days), and also can present small flares. The study of the physical parameters of the spotless active regions observed during solar minimum period between 2007 and 2010 was based on radio maps at 17 GHz obtained by the Nobeyama Radioheliograph (NoRH) and magnetograms provided by the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). The results show that the spotless active regions present a short lifetime but can also live on the solar surface for long periods ( > 10 days). All of these active regions living 5 days or more presented at least one day with sunspot associated to them. During the last minimum (2007 – 2010), our analyses find 92 days without sunspots, that presented active regions at 17 GHz. Since, an active region can live for long periods, those spotless active regions were identified as 48 distinct ones. Du ring their lives, some of these active regions presented days with sunspot associated (128 days). These weak active regions may also present flares, and a small one (class C1.1) was identified.

**Methodology/Approach**
In this study, the active regions at 17 GHz were identiﬁed, just as Selhorst et al.(2014), that is: i) size greater than 150 pixels2 (∼ 300MSS (millionth solar surface)); ii) latitudes between ± 45◦; iii) maximum brightness temperature (Tbmax) at least 40% greater than the quiet Sun value and iv) longitudes < 70◦. The active region size was calculated considering the pixels with Tb equal to 12000 K or more.

**Results/Data**
The lifetimes of the spotless active regions analysed are shown in Figure 1. Almost 50% of them (23) were ephemeral ones and still visible for a maximum of three days. The results show that the spotless active regions present a short lifetime but can also live on the solar surface for long periods ( > 10 days). All of these active regions living 5 days or more presented at least one day with sunspot associated to them.

The panel 3( a ) shows a negative trend in the linear adjust for both, active regions with spots and without them, that is, as magnetic fields increase the flux tends to decrease. The averaged flux of the active regions with spots is 0.81 SFU greater than the spotless ones. In panel 3( b ), Tbmax still constant with the increase of the magnetic field. Moreover, the active regions with spots are 340 0 K hotter than the spotless ones.

**Limitations/Discussion**
A total of 48 distinct active regions were analysed in the period 2007 – 2010. About 50% of them were ephemeral living a maximum of three days. On the other hand, those ones living 5 days more presented at least one day with a sunspot. The act ive regions with sunspots are hotter and presented more flux than the spotless ones. However, the values were signiﬁcantly smaller than the proposed by Livingston et al. (2012) for minimum necessary for the spot formation (1500 G), that could be due to in strumental diﬀerences.
