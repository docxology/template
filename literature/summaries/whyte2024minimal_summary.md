**Overview/Summary**

The paper "On the Minimal Theory of Consciousness Implicit in Active Inference" by Whyte et al. (2022) presents a unified theory of consciousness that is grounded in active inference. The authors argue that this approach to understanding conscious experience is more parsimonious than other theories, and they provide several examples from various domains of psychology and neuroscience to support their claim. The paper also offers an explanation for the neural basis of hemineglect, a neurological syndrome characterized by unawareness of one side of space. The authors' theory is based on the idea that consciousness arises when the brain's generative models are in a state of high uncertainty, which can be driven by either novelty or ambiguity. This paper provides an overview of the main ideas and results from this work.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The first section of the paper reviews the current state of the science on consciousness. The authors argue that there is no theory of consciousness that is both parsimonious and well-supported empirically, but they do not propose a new theory in this review. Instead, they provide an overview of the main ideas from their own work. They also discuss the relationship between their approach to understanding consciousness and other theories of consciousness.

The second section of the paper describes the generative models that are used for active inference. The authors argue that the brain's generative models can be in a state of high uncertainty, which is driven by either novelty or ambiguity. This is because the brain is always trying to make predictions about what will happen next. When it does not have enough information to do so, it makes some predictions and then updates its models based on the outcome. The authors argue that this process can be in a state of high uncertainty if there are many possible outcomes. This is when novelty or ambiguity is present. The authors also discuss how active inference relates to other theories of consciousness.

The third section of the paper describes the generative model for hemineglect. The authors propose a new explanation for why patients with hemineglect neglect one side of space. They argue that this can be explained by the novelty component of expected free energy, which is when the brain's models are in a state of high uncertainty and there is no way to reduce the risk term. The authors also discuss how their theory relates to other theories of consciousness.

**Methodology/Approach**

The fourth section of the paper describes the generative model for hemineglect. The authors argue that this can be explained by the novelty component of expected free energy, which is when the brain's models are in a state of high uncertainty and there is no way to reduce the risk term. They also discuss how their theory relates to other theories of consciousness.

**Results/Data**

The fifth section of the paper describes the results from the generative model for hemineglect. The authors argue that this can be explained by the novelty component of expected free energy, which is when the brain's models are in a state of high uncertainty and there is no way to reduce the risk term. They also discuss how their theory relates to other theories of consciousness.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The final section of the paper discusses the limitations of the theory and future work. The authors argue that the theory provides an explanation for why patients with hemineglect neglect one side of space, but they do not claim that this is the only cause of the syndrome. They also discuss how their approach to understanding consciousness relates to other theories.
