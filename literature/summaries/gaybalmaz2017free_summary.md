**Overview/Summary**

The paper by Podio-Guidugli et al. (2019) is a comprehensive and self-contained presentation of the free energy Lagrangian variational formulation for nonequilibrium thermodynamics. The authors' main goal is to provide a unified framework that encompasses both the classical equilibrium thermodynamics and the non-equilibrium thermodynamics with internal constraints, such as the adiabatic constraint in the case of the adiabatic piston, or the entropy constraint in the case of the Carnot cycle. In this paper, the authors start from the free energy Lagrangian which is the Legendre transform of the Hamilton function and the starting point for the thermodynamics. The main purpose is to provide a unified framework that can be used to derive the equations of motion for the non-equilibrium systems with internal constraints in the same way as the classical equilibrium thermodynamics. This paper is organized into five sections, including the introduction, the free energy Lagrangian variational formulation, the general theory, the application to the Carnot cycle and the adiabatic piston, the application to the dynamics of a simple system, and the conclusion.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contribution of this paper is that it provides a unified framework for the non-equilibrium thermodynamics with internal constraints. The authors' starting point is the free energy Lagrangian which is the Legendre transform of the Hamilton function. This allows them to derive the equations of motion for the non-equilibrium systems in the same way as the classical equilibrium thermodynamics. In this paper, the authors start from the free energy Lagrangian and then use it to derive the equations of motion for the adiabatic piston and the Carnot cycle. The main finding is that the free energy Lagrangian can be used to study the non-equilibrium systems with internal constraints in a unified way. This paper also provides some concrete examples, including the dynamics of an ideal gas and the Carnot cycle. The authors' approach is based on the variational principle which is the foundation for all the thermodynamic theories.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors start from the free energy Lagrangian. They use the free energy Lagrangian to derive the equations of motion for the non-equilibrium systems. In this paper, the authors' approach is based on the variational principle which is the foundation for all the thermodynamic theories.

**Results/Data**

The main result of this paper is that the free energy Lagrangian can be used to study the non-equilibrium systems with internal constraints in a unified way. The authors provide some concrete examples, including the dynamics of an ideal gas and the Carnot cycle.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The main limitation of this paper is that it only provides a general framework for the non-equilibrium systems with internal constraints. It does not provide any concrete applications beyond the Carnot cycle and the adiabatic piston. The authors' approach is based on the variational principle which is the foundation for all the thermodynamic theories.
