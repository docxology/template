**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Multi-Agent Active Search using Detection and Location Uncertainty" [1] presents a novel multi-agent active search approach for autonomous systems to detect and localize unknown objects in an environment. The authors propose a method that leverages the detection uncertainty with location information to select the most informative place to search next. In this paper, the authors first discuss the challenges of using a single agent for active object classiﬁcation, such as the lack of spatial context and the high cost of searching all possible locations. Then they introduce an algorithm that uses the detection uncertainty with location information to select the most informative place to search next. The proposed method is evaluated on the benchmark datasets and compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors make several key contributions in this paper. First, the authors propose a novel multi-agent active search approach that uses the detection uncertainty with location information to select the most informative place to search next. The proposed method is evaluated on the benchmark datasets and compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms. Second, the authors show that the proposed algorithm can achieve better performance than the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of the number of samples needed for the same level of uncertainty. Third, the authors discuss the challenges of using a single agent for active object classiﬁcation and introduce an approach to overcome these challenges.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use a multi-agent system that consists of multiple robots with different sensors. The system is trained by reinforcement learning. In this paper, the authors consider two types of uncertainty: detection uncertainty and location uncertainty. The authors show that the proposed algorithm can achieve better performance than the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of the number of samples needed for the same level of uncertainty.

**Results/Data**

The authors use the benchmark datasets to evaluate the proposed method. The results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve better performance than the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of the number of samples needed for the same level of uncertainty. The authors also compare the proposed method with the state-of-the-art algorithms and discuss the challenges of using a single agent for active object classiﬁcation.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors mention some limitations of their work. For example, the authors do not consider the communication cost between agents in this paper. The authors also mention that the proposed method is myopic because it does not take into account the future rewards when making a decision. The authors suggest that the proposed algorithm can be extended to the multi-robot case with the help of the state-of-the-art algorithms. However, the authors do not discuss how the communication cost can be taken into account in this paper.
