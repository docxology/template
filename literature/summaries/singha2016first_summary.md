**Overview/Summary**

The paper is a comprehensive review of the first moment of azimuthal anisotropy (v1) in heavy-ion collisions. The authors discuss the current status and future prospects for measuring v1 with the ALICE detector at the LHC, as well as the potential to use it as a probe of the properties of the quark-gluon plasma.
