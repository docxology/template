**Overview/Summary**

The paper "A Markovian Formalism for Active Querying" by [Authors] presents a novel framework for active querying that is based on the concept of Markov processes and their associated stochastic differential equations (SDEs). The authors' motivation is to provide a formalism for actively learning about the world while interacting with it. They argue that this problem has been largely ignored in the machine learning literature, despite the fact that many real-world problems involve active querying. In particular, they focus on the case where the queryer can only ask yes/no questions and does not know the outcome of a question before asking it. The authors' goal is to provide a formalism for this type of problem that is both well-defined and computationally tractable.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of the paper are two-fold. First, they introduce a new class of Markov processes called "querying" which are a generalization of the traditional Markov process. The second contribution is to provide a formalism for active querying based on these new Markov processes and their associated SDEs. This formalism is well-defined in that it provides a clear set of rules for how to do active learning, and it is computationally tractable in that it can be solved using the standard methods from differential equations.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors begin by recalling the traditional Markov process. The key idea is that the next state depends only on the current state. This means that the probability of a transition between two states does not depend on any other information, but rather only on the current state. The paper then introduces the new class of "querying" which is a generalization of the traditional Markov process. In this case, the next state depends on both the current state and the query that was asked. This means that the probability of a transition between two states does not depend only on the current state, but also on the query that was asked. The authors' main contribution is to show how these new processes can be used for active learning.

**Results/Data**

The paper then shows how this formalism can be used for active querying. In particular, they provide a set of rules for how to do active learning and a set of algorithms for solving the SDEs that are associated with the Markov process. They also show some examples of how these new processes can be used.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors' main contribution is to introduce this formalism, which they argue provides a clear set of rules for active learning and a set of algorithms for solving the SDEs that are associated with the Markov process. The paper also shows some examples of how these new processes can be used. However, the authors do not discuss any limitations or weaknesses of their approach.
