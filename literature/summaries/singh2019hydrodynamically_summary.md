**Overview/Summary**

The paper studies a hydrodynamically driven instability in the dynamics of an active scalar field with mass and momentum conservation. The authors consider the effects of the non-conserved stress tensor on the self-organization of the system, which is described by the following equation:

$$ \partial_t \phi = -\nabla^2 \phi + M \nabla^4 \phi - D \nabla^6 \phi + a |\phi| \phi + b |\phi|^3 + c \nabla^2 (\nabla^2 \phi)^2, $$

where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the coefficients of the nonlinear terms. The authors find that the non-conserved stress tensor can either enhance or suppress the instability depending on the sign of the parameter $M$. For $M>0$, the instability is enhanced by the active stress while it is suppressed for $M<0$. This is in contrast to the case with the conserved stress where the instability is always enhanced. The authors also find that the non-conserved stress can lead to a self-organization of the system, which is different from the case with the conserved stress.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contribution of this paper is the study of the effects of the non-conserved stress on the self-organization and the stability of the system. The authors find that the non-conserved stress can either enhance or suppress the instability depending on the sign of $M$. For $M>0$, the instability is enhanced by the active stress while it is suppressed for $M<0$. This is in contrast to the case with the conserved stress where the instability is always enhanced. The authors also find that the non-conserved stress can lead to a self-organization of the system, which is different from the case with the conserved stress.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use numerical simulations and analytical calculations to study the effects of the non-conserved stress on the instability. They first perform numerical simulations for $M>0$ and find that the non-conserved stress can lead to a self-organization of the system. The authors then show that this is not possible in the case with the conserved stress.

**Results/Data**

The authors use numerical simulations to study the effects of the non-conserved stress on the instability. They first perform numerical simulations for $M>0$ and find that the non-conserved stress can lead to a self-organization of the system. The authors then show that this is not possible in the case with the conserved stress.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The paper studies the effects of the non-conserved stress on the instability, which is an important topic in the study of the dynamics of active scalar fields. The authors use numerical simulations and analytical calculations to find the answer. The results are different from the previous case with the conserved stress.
