**Overview/Summary**
The paper "Aline: Joint Amortization for Bayesian Inference" presents a new amortized inference algorithm called ALINE that jointly amortizes the computation of the posterior and the likelihood over the entire data set, which is particularly useful in the context of sequential decision-making. The authors show that this joint amortization can be done without any additional assumptions about the distribution of the data or the model, while still achieving a significant speedup compared to the state-of-the-art methods. They also provide an empirical study on three different datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of their algorithm for both the Bayesian inference and the decision-making.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The authors first show that the amortization of the likelihood is not sufficient for the amortization of the posterior, which may be a common assumption in the literature. They then propose an amortized inference algorithm called ALINE that jointly amortizes the computation of the posterior and the likelihood over the entire data set. The key contributions are as follows:
- **The amortization of the likelihood is not sufficient for the amortization of the posterior**: The authors first show that the amortization of the likelihood is not sufficient for the amortization of the posterior, which may be a common assumption in the literature. They prove this by showing an example where the amortization of the likelihood does not imply the amortization of the posterior.
- **The amortized inference algorithm ALINE**: The authors then propose an amortized inference algorithm called ALINE that jointly amortizes the computation of the posterior and the likelihood over the entire data set. The key idea is to use a two-stage procedure where the first stage is to compute the amortized likelihood, and the second stage is to use the amortized likelihood for the amortization of the posterior.
- **The amortization of the posterior can be done without any additional assumptions**: The authors show that this joint amortization can be done without any additional assumptions about the distribution of the data or the model. They also provide an empirical study on three different datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of their algorithm for both the Bayesian inference and the decision-making.
- **The amortized likelihood is not sufficient for the amortization of the posterior**: The authors then show that this joint amortization can be done without any additional assumptions about the distribution of the data or the model. They also provide an empirical study on three different datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of their algorithm for both the Bayesian inference and the decision-making.

**Methodology/Approach**
The paper is organized as follows: The authors first show that the amortization of the likelihood is not sufficient for the amortization of the posterior, which may be a common assumption in the literature. They then propose an amortized inference algorithm called ALINE that jointly amortizes the computation of the posterior and the likelihood over the entire data set. The key idea is to use a two-stage procedure where the first stage is to compute the amortized likelihood, and the second stage is to use the amortized likelihood for the amortization of the posterior.

**Results/Data**
The authors provide an empirical study on three different datasets, including the MNIST dataset, the CIFAR-10 dataset, and the 20 Newsgroup dataset. The results are as follows:
- **MNIST dataset**: The authors first use the MNIST dataset to show that the amortization of the likelihood is not sufficient for the amortization of the posterior. They then provide an empirical study on the MNIST dataset where they compare the ALINE algorithm with the state-of-the-art algorithms, including the VFE and the GMM.
- **CIFAR-10 dataset**: The authors next use the CIFAR-10 dataset to show that the joint amortization can be done without any additional assumptions. They also provide an empirical study on the CIFAR-10 dataset where they compare the ALINE algorithm with the state-of-the-art algorithms, including the VFE and the GMM.
- **20 Newsgroup dataset**: The authors finally use the 20 Newsgroup dataset to show that the amortization of the likelihood is not sufficient for the amortization of the posterior. They also provide an empirical study on the 20 Newsgroup dataset where they compare the ALINE algorithm with the state-of-the-art algorithms, including the VFE and the GMM.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The authors discuss the following limitations:
- **The amortized likelihood is not sufficient for the amortization of the posterior**: The authors show that this joint amortization can be done without any additional assumptions about the distribution of the data or the model. They also provide an empirical study on three different datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of their algorithm for both the Bayesian inference and the decision-making.
