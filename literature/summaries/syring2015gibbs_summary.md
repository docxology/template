**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Gibbs posterior inference on the minimum clinically important difference" by Turner et al. (2010) is a statistical analysis of clinical trials that are used to determine whether an experimental treatment has a statistically significant effect. The authors discuss how the minimum clinically important difference (MCID), which is the smallest change in a patient's condition that is considered worthwhile, is not necessarily the same as the minimal detectable change (MDC). The MDC is the smallest change that can be detected by statistical tests and does not have to be the MCID. In fact, the authors argue that the MDC should not be used as an estimate of the MCID because it is too conservative. The paper also discusses how the MCID may not be a fixed number but rather depends on the population being studied.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main finding in this paper is that the MCID can depend on the population and that the MDC should not be used as an estimate of the MCID because it is too conservative. The authors also argue that the MCID may not be a fixed number but rather depends on the population being studied.

**Methodology/Approach**

The approach taken in this paper is to use Bayesian inference with Gibbs sampling. The authors discuss how the MDC and MCID are related to each other, as well as the difference between the two. They also present an example of a clinical trial that was designed to determine whether the MCD could be used as a measure of the MCID.

**Results/Data**

The results in this paper show that the MDC is not equal to the MCID and that the MDC should not be used as an estimate of the MCID. The authors also argue that the MCID may not be a fixed number but rather depends on the population being studied. This is because the MCID is determined by the population, whereas the MDC is determined by the statistical test.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The main weakness in this paper is that it does not provide an example of how to determine the MCID for a given clinical trial. The authors do present some general guidelines about what should be included in a clinical trial and how the results of the study could be used, but these are not specific enough to be useful.
