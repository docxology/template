**Overview/Summary**

The paper explores the optimal foraging strategy of a Lévy flight in an environment with a patchy distribution of resources. The authors consider the problem of finding the most efficient way to search for food when the probability of finding it at any given location is proportional to the square root of the distance from the origin, and the cost of searching is proportional to the distance. They use a simple model based on the Lévy flight that has been used in many different contexts. The authors' main interest is in the optimal strategy for the case where the probability of finding food at any given location is independent of the distance from the origin. In this paper, they consider the case where the probability of finding food at any given location is proportional to the square root of the distance from the origin. They show that the optimal foraging strategy in this case is a Lévy flight with an optimal step size. The authors also compare the efficiency of different strategies and discuss the effect on the optimal strategy when the cost of searching is not proportional to the distance.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contribution of the paper is the proof that the optimal foraging strategy in this case is a Lévy flight with an optimal step size. The authors also compare the efficiency of different strategies and discuss the effect on the optimal strategy when the cost of searching is not proportional to the distance.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors first consider the case where the probability of finding food at any given location is independent of the distance from the origin. They show that in this case, the optimal foraging strategy is a Lévy flight with an optimal step size. Then they compare the efficiency of different strategies and discuss the effect on the optimal strategy when the cost of searching is not proportional to the distance.

**Results/Data**

The authors first consider the case where the probability of finding food at any given location is independent of the distance from the origin. They show that in this case, the optimal foraging strategy is a Lévy flight with an optimal step size. Then they compare the efficiency of different strategies and discuss the effect on the optimal strategy when the cost of searching is not proportional to the distance.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors' main interest is in the optimal strategy for the case where the probability of finding food at any given location is independent of the distance from the origin. They show that in this case, the optimal foraging strategy is a Lévy flight with an optimal step size. The authors also compare the efficiency of different strategies and discuss the effect on the optimal strategy when the cost of searching is not proportional to the distance.
