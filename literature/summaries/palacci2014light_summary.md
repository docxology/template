**Overview/Summary**

The paper describes a novel system of self-propelled colloids where the direction of motion is controlled by light. The authors demonstrate that the colloids can be steered in one direction and then form dense clusters, which are stabilized by an attractive interaction between the particles. This is achieved by using a combination of a photo-activated phoretic force and a persistent self-propulsion mechanism. The paper also shows how the system can be used to study the transition from a gas phase to a liquid or solid state.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main findings of this work are twofold. First, the authors demonstrate that the colloids can be steered in one direction by an external magnetic field and then form dense clusters. This is achieved by using a combination of a photo-activated phoretic force and a persistent self-propulsion mechanism. The paper also shows how the system can be used to study the transition from a gas phase to a liquid or solid state. Second, the authors show that the attractive interaction between the particles is responsible for the formation of the clusters.

**Methodology/Approach**

The approach taken in this work is based on the use of a combination of a photo-activated phoretic force and a persistent self-propulsion mechanism. The colloids are made up of 2µm diameter silica beads with a thin layer of gold on one side, which is coated with a 1nm thick layer of hematite (Fe2O3). The system is studied in a near-critical water-lutidine mixture where the particles can be optically resolved. This allows the direction of self-propulsion to be determined by the orientation of the particle. The authors use an external magnetic field to steer the colloids and measure the number fluctuations in the system.

**Results/Data**

The results are based on a combination of experimental and theoretical work. The experimental data is used to test the predictions made from the theory. The main finding is that the attractive interaction between the particles is responsible for the formation of the clusters. This is demonstrated by comparing the experimental data with the results from the theory. The authors show how the system can be used to study the transition from a gas phase to a liquid or solid state.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The main limitation of this work is that it does not address the issue of the long-term stability of the clusters. This could be studied by using a combination of the photo-activated phoretic force and the persistent self-propulsion mechanism in the absence of an external magnetic field, or by comparing the results from the theory with the experimental data obtained without the use of the external magnetic field. The authors also do not address the issue of the long-term stability of the clusters. This could be studied by using a combination of the photo-activated phoretic force and the persistent self-propulsion mechanism in the absence of an external magnetic field, or by comparing the results from the theory with the experimental data obtained without the use of the external magnetic field.
