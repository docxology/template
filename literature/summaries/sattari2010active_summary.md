**Overview/Summary**

The paper proposes a novel network coding based approach for active topology inference in multi-hop networks. The authors first identify the challenges of inferring the topology of a single tree network and then generalize these to the case of a multiple-tree (M-by-N) network, which is more complex since it can have different types of 2-vertex subnetworks. They show that the observations at the receivers no longer uniquely characterize the underlying M-by-N topology in the latter case. The authors propose an approach for inferring the type of every 2-vertex subnetwork and then merge these to reconstruct the M-by-N network. For this, they use a pair of sources to send up to countMax coordinated multicast packets to all receivers. They tune the timing parameters T, u, W so that the two sources meet at the same or different points for all the receivers in dient experiments and then design inference algorithms based on these observations. The authors first identify the type of every 2-vertex subnetwork and then merge these to reconstruct the M-by-N network.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The key contributions of this paper are the novel observation, the new approach for inferring the topology of a multiple-tree (M-by-N) network based on the observations at the receivers, and the experimental results that demonstrate the eﬃectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The authors show that the 2-vertex subnetworks in an M-by-N network can be classified into four types: shared, non-shared with two distinct sources, and non-shared with one source. They also propose a novel inference approach for inferring the type of every 2-vertex subnetwork based on the observations at the receivers. The authors show that the proposed algorithm is eﬃective in identifying the topology of an M-by-N network.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use several experiments and w.r.t. the ﬁrst step, they exactly identify the type of every 2-vertex subnetwork. For this, they use a pair of sources to send up to countMax coordinated multicast packets to all receivers. They tune the timing parameters T, u, W so that the two sources meet at the same or different points for all the receivers in dient experiments and then design inference algorithms based on these observations. The authors first identify the type of every 2-vertex subnetwork and then merge these to reconstruct the M-by-N network.

**Results/Data**

The results show that the proposed algorithm is eﬃective in identifying the topology of an M-by-N network. The authors use a pair of sources to send up to countMax coordinated multicast packets to all receivers. They tune the timing parameters T, u, W so that the two sources meet at the same or different points for all the receivers in dient experiments and then design inference algorithms based on these observations. The results show that the proposed algorithm is eﬃective in identifying the topology of an M-by-N network.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The limitation of this paper is that it only considers a pair of sources to send up to countMax coordinated multicast packets to all receivers. The authors do not discuss how to extend their approach for multiple pairs of sources and how to improve the accuracy of the proposed algorithm. The authors also do not compare their approach with other existing approaches in the literature.
