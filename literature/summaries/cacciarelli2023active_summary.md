**Overview/Summary**
The paper presents a survey on active learning for data streams. The main goal of this work is to provide an overview of the existing literature and identify some open problems in the field. It starts by giving a brief introduction to the topic, discussing the importance of online learning with streaming data, and then gives a detailed review of the existing works. The paper also provides some insights on how to solve the cold-start problem.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The main contributions of this work are:
- A survey of the existing literature in active learning for data streams.
- An analysis of the existing works from different aspects, including the methods, algorithms and applications.
- Some open problems in the field.

**Methodology/Approach**
The paper starts by giving a brief introduction to the topic. The main part of this work is the survey on the existing literature. It first gives an overview of the importance of online learning with streaming data, then reviews the existing works from different aspects, including the methods, algorithms and applications.

**Results/Data**
The paper does not have any results or data in the classical sense. Instead, it provides a review of the existing works on active learning for data streams. The main part is the survey which is divided into three parts: the importance of online learning with streaming data, the methods and the algorithms. The last part is the applications.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The paper does not have any limitations or discussion in the classical sense. Instead, it provides some open problems in the field. It also gives a brief summary on how to solve the cold-start problem.
