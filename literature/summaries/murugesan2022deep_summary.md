=== OVERVIEW/SUMMARY ===
Deep Surrogate of Modular Multi Pump using Active Learning

The paper presents a novel approach to predict the surge distance (SD) in a modular multi-pump (MCP) system with a deep neural network, which is trained by an active learning framework. The SD prediction has been considered as a challenging problem due to its non-linear relationship and high dimensionality of the input data. The authors use a dataset from experiments on a 3-stage axial flow compressor (AFC) in a gas turbine engine. This paper's main contributions are three-fold. Firstly, they propose a deep surrogate model based on a neural network to predict the SD with its uncertainty. Secondly, they compare the performance of the proposed approach with that of the baseline method using random sampling. Finally, the authors present an active learning algorithm based on the variance of the data points in the pool set and use it to select the most informative samples for training the surrogate model.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the methodology and approach used in this study. The deep surrogate model is trained by using a dataset from experiments on a 3-stage axial flow compressor (AFC) in a gas turbine engine, which has 12 variables including the temperature of the air at the inlet (Tin), the pressure of the air at the inlet (Pin), the rotational speed (Nspeed), and the diﬀerential pressure (∆P). The authors use the same dataset as that used to select the underlying model. Section 3 presents the results and discussions about the performance of the proposed approach compared with the baseline method using random sampling. In this section, the authors also present an active learning algorithm based on the variance of the data points in the pool set and use it to select the most informative samples for training the surrogate model.
