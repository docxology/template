**Overview/Summary**
The paper "Active Inference on the Edge: A Design Study" proposes a novel approach for designing cloud-native services that ensure their service level objectives (SLOs) are met by using active inference (AI). The authors argue that AI can be used to train a machine learning model to defend against attacks and misconfigurations. They demonstrate this idea in the context of a big data machine, where an adversary can manipulate the data stream on the edge. The main contribution is a design study for training a big data machine to detect fake mobile crowd-sensing tasks. The authors also provide a privacy enforcing framework for transforming data streams on the edge.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The key contributions of this paper are:
- A novel approach for training a big data machine to defend against attacks and misconfigurations
- A design study for training a big data machine to detect fake mobile crowd-sensing tasks
- A privacy enforcing framework for transforming data streams on the edge

**Methodology/Approach**
The authors use active inference (AI) as their computational framework. AI is based on the free energy principle, which states that all probabilistic processes can be understood in terms of the minimization of a quantity called free energy. The free energy is the sum of two quantities: the negative log-likelihood and the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the model's predictions and the true distribution. In order to minimize the free energy, the AI algorithm needs to make an inference about the state of the world. This process can be seen as a form of learning or training. The authors use a big data machine (BDM) as their example. A BDM is a large-scale distributed computing system that processes and analyzes a massive amount of data. It can be used for various applications, such as processing and analyzing mobile crowd-sensing data. In this paper, the authors focus on using AI to train a BDM to detect fake mobile crowd-sensing tasks. The authors also provide a privacy enforcing framework for transforming data streams on the edge.

**Results/Data**
The main results of this paper are:
- A novel approach for training a big data machine to defend against attacks and misconfigurations
- A design study for training a big data machine to detect fake mobile crowd-sensing tasks
- A privacy enforcing framework for transforming data streams on the edge

**Limitations/Discussion**
The limitations of this paper are:
- The authors only demonstrate their approach in the context of detecting fake mobile crowd-sensing tasks. This is not a general solution that can be applied to all types of attacks and misconfigurations.
- The BDM is a large-scale distributed computing system that processes and analyzes a massive amount of data. It can be used for various applications, such as processing and analyzing mobile crowd-sensing data. In this paper, the authors focus on using AI to train a BDM to detect fake mobile crowd-sensing tasks. This is not a general solution that can be applied to all types of attacks and misconfigurations.
- The privacy enforcing framework proposed in this paper only applies to data streams on the edge. It does not apply to data stored in the cloud or other places.
