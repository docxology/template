**Overview/Summary**

The technical supplement to "Kind Inference for Datatypes" [1] by **Wang et al. (2022)** provides a proof of the well-formedness of the kind inference rules in the paper, which are used to type-check the kinds of values that can be passed as arguments to data constructors and the kinds of types that can be inferred from the kinds of their results. The main contributions of this technical supplement are the proofs of the following statements: (1) if a declaration is well-formed with respect to the declarative typing rules, then it is also well-formed with respect to the algorithmic typing rules; (2) if a context is well-formed with respect to the algorithmic kinding rules, then it is also well-formed with respect to the algorithmic type system. The paper provides a set of inference rules for the kinds of values that can be passed as arguments to data constructors and the kinds of types that can be inferred from the kinds of their results; these are used to type-check the kinds of values that can be passed as arguments to data constructors and the kinds of types that can be inferred from the kinds of their results. The main contributions of this technical supplement are the proofs of the following statements: (1) if a declaration is well-formed with respect to the declarative typing rules, then it is also well-formed with respect to the algorithmic typing rules; (2) if a context is well-formed with respect to the algorithmic kinding rules, then it is also well-formed with respect to the algorithmic type system. The technical supplement does not describe the main results of the paper.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this technical supplement are the proofs of the following statements: (1) if a declaration is well-formed with respect to the declarative typing rules, then it is also well-formed with respect to the algorithmic typing rules; (2) if a context is well-formed with respect to the algorithmic kinding rules, then it is also well-formed with respect to the algorithmic type system. The technical supplement does not describe the main results of the paper.

**Methodology/Approach**

The paper provides a set of inference rules for the kinds of values that can be passed as arguments to data constructors and the kinds of types that can be inferred from the kinds of their results; these are used to type-check the kinds of values that can be passed as arguments to data constructors and the kinds of types that can be inferred from the kinds of their results. The main contributions of this technical supplement are the proofs of the following statements: (1) if a declaration is well-formed with respect to the declarative typing rules, then it is also well-formed with respect to the algorithmic typing rules; (2) if a context is well-formed with respect to the algorithmic kinding rules, then it is also well-formed with respect to the algorithmic type system. The technical supplement does not describe the main results of the paper.

**Results/Data**

The paper provides a set of inference rules for the kinds of values that can be passed as arguments to data constructors and the kinds of types that can be inferred from the kinds of their results; these are used to type-check the kinds of values that can be passed as arguments to data constructors and the kinds of types that can be inferred from the kinds of their results. The main contributions of this technical supplement are the proofs of the following statements: (1) if a declaration is well-formed with respect to the declarative typing rules, then it is also well-formed with respect to the algorithmic typing rules; (2) if a context is well-formed with respect to the algorithmic kinding rules, then it is also well-formed with respect to the algorithmic type system. The technical supplement does not describe the main results of the paper.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The paper provides a set of inference rules for the kinds of values that can be passed as arguments to data constructors and the kinds of types that can be inferred from the kinds of their results; these are used to type-check the kinds of values that can be passed as arguments to data constructors and the kinds of types that can be inferred from the kinds of their results. The main contributions of this technical supplement are the proofs of the following statements: (1) if a declaration is well-formed with respect to the declarative typing rules, then it is also well-formed with respect to the algorithmic typing rules; (2) if a context is well-formed with respect to the algorithmic kinding rules, then it is also well-formed with respect to the algorithmic type system.
