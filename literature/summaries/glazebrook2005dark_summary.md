**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Dark Energy and Cosmic Sound: w(z) from 600,000 Luminous Red Galaxies at z~1" by Steidel et al. (1996) is a seminal work that presents the first large sample of high-redshift luminous galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field North (HDFN). The authors use the Lyman alpha emission line to measure the redshifts and the equivalent widths of 600,000 LBGs at z~1. They find that the median value of w(z) is -0.04, which is consistent with a flat universe. In this paper, I will summarize the key contributions, findings, methodology, results, limitations, and discussion of this work.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contribution of this paper is the measurement of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) peak in the galaxy power spectrum at z~1. The BAO peak is a standard ruler that can be used to measure the expansion history of the universe, which is sensitive to the dark energy equation of state w(z). The authors use the 600,000 LBGs in the Hubble Deep Field North (HDFN) and the 100,000 LBGs in the Keck Deep Fields (KDF) to place a strong constraint on the value of w(z), which is one of the most important cosmological parameters that can be used to test the dark energy models. The paper also provides a comprehensive review of the previous measurements of the BAO peak at z~0.5, and it shows that the BAO peak in the galaxy power spectrum is robust against the systematic errors. The authors use the 600,000 LBGs in the Hubble Deep Field North (HDFN) to measure the BAO peak at z~1. They find that the median value of w(z) is -0.04, which is consistent with a flat universe. In this paper, I will summarize the key contributions and findings.

**Results/Data**

The main result of this paper is the measurement of the BAO peak in the galaxy power spectrum at z~1.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The main limitation of this work is the large systematic errors in the measurement of the BAO peak at z~1. The authors use the 600,000 LBGs in the Hubble Deep Field North (HDFN) to measure the BAO peak at z~1. They find that the median value of w(z) is -0.04, which is consistent with a flat universe.
