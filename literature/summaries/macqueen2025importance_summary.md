**Overview/Summary**

The current study is a PhD thesis by Samuel A. Mather (SAM) in ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of British Columbia Okanagan that explores how the omission of exploration from models of site-constant foraging can bias predictions of certain types of landscape use, such as pollination services. The researchers used an individual-based model to explore the effects of including a separate phase of exploration on predicted foraging outcomes in different landscapes and with different parameters. They found that the omission of this exploratory process is potentially creating biases in predictions for certain types of landscape use and can dramatically alter predicted foraging outcomes.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The researchers used an individual-based model to explore how a separate phase of exploration affects predicted foraging outcomes in different landscapes and with different parameters. They found that the omission of this exploratory process is potentially creating biases in predictions for certain types of landscape use and can dramatically alter predicted foraging outcomes.

**Methodology/Approach**

The researchers used an individual-based model to explore how a separate phase of exploration affects predicted foraging outcomes in different landscapes and with different parameters. They found that the omission of this exploratory process is potentially creating biases in predictions for certain types of landscape use and can dramatically alter predicted foraging outcomes.

**Results/Data**

The researchers found that the omission of site-constant foraging from models is potentially creating biases in predictions for certain types of landscape use and can dramatically alter predicted foraging outcomes. The results show that the omission of this exploratory process is most important when predicting visits to a particular type of resource patch, i.e., pollination services, and least important when measuring the behavioural energy budget of the forager.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The researchers note that it is impossible to model all behaviours exactly as they occur in real life. Instead, the research question can help determine which behaviours should be included, and which are not essential to answering the question. Most modelling studies of site-constant foraging do not explicitly include a separate exploration phase as part of the identification of a foraging location. The researchers' work demonstrates that the omission of this exploratory process is most important when predicting visits to a particular type of resource patch, i.e., pollination services, and least important when measuring the behavioural energy budget of the forager.
