**Overview/Summary**

The paper Probabilistic Active Goal Recognition (PAGR) is a novel probabilistic formulation of the Active Goal Recognition problem in the Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework, which enables principled reasoning under uncertainty. The main contributions are twofold: (1) a formal definition of PAGR grounded in the POMDP framework, and (2) an integrated solution framework that combines joint belief update with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to efficiently solve the problem without relying on domain-specific knowledge.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions are twofold. The first is a formal definition of PAGR grounded in the POMDP framework, which enables principled reasoning under uncertainty; and the second is an integrated solution framework that combines joint belief update with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to efficiently solve the problem without relying on domain-specific knowledge.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors develop a comprehensive set of baselines to empirically evaluate the effectiveness of their approach. The joint belief update was shown to significantly outperform passive goal recognition methods by making more effective use of available information. Additionally, the domain-independent MCTS approach performed comparable to that of our strong domain-specific greedy algorithm, suggesting a promising direction for future work on developing more effective domain-independent methods for PAGR.

**Results/Data**

The joint belief update was shown to significantly outperform passive goal recognition methods by making more effective use of available information. Additionally, the domain-independent MCTS approach performed comparable to that of our strong domain-specific greedy algorithm, suggesting a promising direction for future work on developing more effective domain-independent methods for PAGR.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The presented contributions push the boundaries of AGR and offer a rigorous platform for continued exploration in multi-agent reasoning, goal inference, and decision-making under uncertainty.
