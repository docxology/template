**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Hausdorff and packing spectra, large deviations" by S. J. Taylor is a research article in the field of probability theory that deals with the study of Hausdorff and packing measures on Polish spaces. The main purpose of this paper is to investigate the asymptotic behavior of the Hausdorff measure and the packing measure for the class of all compact subsets of a given Polish space, which are called the Hausdorff and packing spectra respectively. In particular, it deals with the large deviation principle (LDP) for these two measures on the set of all closed subsets. The LDP is a result that describes the asymptotic behavior of the probability measure on the space of all closed subsets of a given Polish space, which are called the Hausdorff and packing spectra respectively.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this paper are the following two results:

1. **Large deviation principle for the Hausdorff spectrum**: The authors prove that if $K$ is a compact subset of a Polish space $X$, then there exists an open set $\mathcal{D}$ in the set of all closed subsets of $X$ such that the Hausdorff measure on the set of all closed subsets of $X$ satisfies the LDP with speed function $f(x)=\log x$ and rate function $I(x)$, where $I(x)$ is the Hausdorff spectrum. The authors also show that if $\mathcal{D}$ is not empty, then the Hausdorff spectrum is a continuous function.

2. **Large deviation principle for the packing spectrum**: The authors prove that if $K$ is a compact subset of a Polish space $X$, then there exists an open set $\mathcal{E}$ in the set of all closed subsets of $X$ such that the packing measure on the set of all closed subsets of $X$ satisfies the LDP with speed function $f(x)=\log x$ and rate function $J(x)$, where $J(x)$ is the packing spectrum. The authors also show that if $\mathcal{E}$ is not empty, then the packing spectrum is a continuous function.

**Methodology/Approach**

The paper does not provide any new methodology or approach for proving the LDP. The proof of the LDP is based on the general theory of the LDP and the variational formula for the rate function. The authors use the fact that the Hausdorff measure and the packing measure are both a special case of the so-called "logarithmic energy" functional, which was introduced by R. S. Ellis in 1965.

**Results/Data**

The main results of this paper are two LDPs for the Hausdorff and packing spectra. The first one is an LDP with speed function $f(x)=\log x$ and rate function $I(x)$, where $I(x)$ is the Hausdorff spectrum. The second one is an LDP with speed function $f(x)=\log x$ and rate function $J(x)$, where $J(x)$ is the packing spectrum. The authors also show that if $\mathcal{D}$ (resp. $\mathcal{E}$) is not empty, then the Hausdorff (resp. packing) spectrum is a continuous function.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The main limitation of this paper is that it does not provide any new methodology or approach for proving the LDP. The proof of the LDP is based on the general theory of the LDP and the variational formula for the rate function. The authors use the fact that the Hausdorff measure and the packing measure are both a special case of the so-called "logarithmic energy" functional, which was introduced by R. S. Ellis in 1965.

**Additional Information**

The paper is well written and the results are clearly presented. The authors provide a good overview of the main results at the beginning of the paper. The proofs of the two LDPs for the Hausdorff and packing spectra are not difficult to follow. The paper could be used as a reference for readers who want to learn about the general theory of the LDP.
