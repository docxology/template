**Overview/Summary**

The present work proposes a unified model of collision avoidance behavior in driving based on active inference (AI), which is an extension of the free energy principle. The authors argue that AI can be used to explain the various behavioral phenomena observed in human driving, and they show that this is possible by considering the driver's decision-making process as an optimization problem. In the model, the driver's behavior is described as a probabilistic inference over the state of the environment, which is assumed to be a Markov chain. The authors first describe the AI framework for collision avoidance based on the free energy principle and then use this framework to explain some behavioral phenomena observed in human driving.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contribution of the paper is that it shows how the AI model can unify various behavioral phenomena, such as the effect of time gap, the effect of prediction error, the effect of added noise in behavior prediction, and the effect of added noise in state perception. The authors also show that the AI model can be used to explain some other behavioral phenomena observed in human driving.

**Methodology/Approach**

The paper starts by describing the AI framework for collision avoidance based on the free energy principle. In this framework, the driver's behavior is described as a probabilistic inference over the state of the environment, which is assumed to be a Markov chain. The authors then use this framework to explain some behavioral phenomena observed in human driving.

**Results/Data**

The paper shows that the AI model can account for the various behavioral phenomena observed in human driving. The results are shown by comparing the predictions from the AI model with the human data, and the differences between them are discussed in detail. The authors also show that the AI model can be used to explain some other behavioral phenomena observed in human driving.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The paper does not discuss the limitations of the AI model or future work.
