**Overview/Summary**

The paper introduces Tierkreis, a dataflow framework for hybrid quantum-classical algorithms. The authors aim to provide a flexible and efficient way of building and executing complex hybrid quantum-classical algorithms that can be used in various domains such as chemistry, materials science, and machine learning.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

Tierkreis is designed to support the development of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for near-term applications. The authors' main contributions are:

1. **Hybrid dataflow framework**: Tierkreis provides a flexible and efficient way of building and executing complex hybrid quantum-classical algorithms that can be used in various domains such as chemistry, materials science, and machine learning.
2. **Tiered dataflow model**: A tiered dataflow model is introduced to support the development of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms. The authors' main findings are:
    - The paper introduces a new type of dataflow framework that can be used for building and executing complex hybrid quantum-classical algorithms.
    - The authors provide a flexible and efficient way of building and executing complex hybrid quantum-classical algorithms.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use the following approaches in their work:
1. **Dataflow frameworks**: The authors use dataflow frameworks to build and execute complex hybrid quantum-classical algorithms.
2. **Type inference**: The authors use type inference for automatic capture of values in closures.
3. **Incremental type inference**: The authors use incremental type inference if the addition of a node fails an incremental type check, a Python exception is raised at the offending line.

**Results/Data**

The results of this work are:
1. **Circuit builder environment**: The authors provide a circuit builder environment based on decorators.
2. **Incremental type inference**: The authors use incremental type inference if the addition of a node fails an incremental type check, a Python exception is raised at the offending line.
3. **Python nodes and pytket workers**: The authors use functions from the built-in (bi), python nodes (pn) and pytket (pt) workers to build the graph.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The limitations of this work are:
1. **No discussion on the scalability of Tierkreis**: The paper does not provide a comprehensive comparison with other dataflow frameworks.
2. **Limited discussion on the use cases of Tierkreis**: The authors do not discuss the use cases of their framework in detail.
