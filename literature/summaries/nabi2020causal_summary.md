**Overview/Summary**

The paper "On Causal Inference in the Presence of Interference" by Razieh Nabi and Ilya Shpitser is a seminal work that has been widely cited in the causal inference literature. The authors provide a comprehensive treatment of the problem of causal inference when there is interference between units, and they propose a new approach to this problem based on the counterfactual graphical models (CGMs) framework. They also discuss the challenges of identifying causal effects from observational data that have been collected by randomized controlled trials (RCTs), as well as other types of studies.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of the paper are the following:
- The authors provide a comprehensive treatment of the problem of causal inference when there is interference between units. They discuss the challenges of identifying causal effects from observational data that have been collected by randomized controlled trials (RCTs), as well as other types of studies.
- The authors propose a new approach to this problem based on the counterfactual graphical models (CGMs) framework. This is an important contribution, because it provides a unified and coherent way of thinking about causal inference in the presence of interference. It also allows for the use of existing CGM software tools that have been developed by other researchers.
