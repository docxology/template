Overview/Summary
The paper proposes a prediction-free coordinated optimization framework for long-term energy management of microgrids with hybrid power sources and load forecasting. The proposed model is based on a multi-stage rolling horizon (MSRH) strategy, which can solve the problem that the traditional single-stage rolling horizon (SSRH) method cannot handle. In this paper, the authors first propose an SSRH-based optimization framework for long-term energy management of microgrids with hybrid power sources and load forecasting. The proposed SSRH-based optimization framework is a two-stage model. The first stage is to solve the problem that the traditional single-stage rolling horizon (SSRH) method cannot handle. In the second stage, the authors propose an SSRH-based optimization framework for long-term energy management of microgrids with hybrid power sources and load forecasting. The proposed SSRH-based optimization framework is a two-stage model. In the first stage, the authors formulate a multi-period optimization problem to minimize the total cost of the system in each time period. The objective function of the problem is the sum of the costs of all the time periods. The decision variables are the power dispatch strategy and the state-of-charge (SOC) of the battery. In the second stage, the authors formulate an SSRH-based optimization framework for long-term energy management of microgrids with hybrid power sources and load forecasting.
