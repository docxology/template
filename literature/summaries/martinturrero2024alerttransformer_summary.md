**Overview/Summary**

The paper "ALERT-Transformer: Bridging Asynchronous and Synchronous Processing" proposes a novel end-to-end system that enables continuous and energy-efficient data processing for event-based vision sensors. The authors first introduce the problem of bridging the gap between asynchronous, event-based signal processing and conventional signal processing. They then present an asynchronous sensing to on-demand synchronous processing framework: the ALERT-Transformer. This is an end-to-end system that ensures continuous and energy-efficient data processing for event-based vision sensors. The paper also presents a novel end-to-end system that enables high accuracy with lowest ever latency during inference, outperforming comparative models with higher accuracy but slower processing.
