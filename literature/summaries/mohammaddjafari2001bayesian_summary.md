**Overview/Summary**

The paper is concerned with Bayesian inference for inverse problems in image restoration and deconvolution. The authors present a full Bayesian approach to solve the problem of estimating the original image from its noisy observation, which can be considered as an ill-posed problem. In this case, the prior information about the unknown image is very important. They show that the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator for the inverse problems in the spatial domain and the frequency domain are different. The MAP estimator in the spatial domain is the same as the one obtained by the Gibbs sampler, which is based on the Markov random field (MRF). The authors also present a new class of scale invariant Bayesian estimators for linear inverse problems, which can be used to solve both the spatial and frequency domains. They use the stochastic approximation (SA) algorithm to compute this MAP estimator in the case where the number of observations is large. In addition, they compare the proposed approach with some other approaches.
