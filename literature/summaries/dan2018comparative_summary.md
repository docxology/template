Title: A Comparative Study: Adaptive Fuzzy Inference Systems
Overview/Summary:
The paper presents a comparative study of three adaptive fuzzy inference systems (AFIS), namely the dynamic evolving neuro-fuzzy inference system (DENFIS), the sequential adaptive fuzzy inference system (SAFIS) and the meta-cognitive neuro-fuzzy inference system (McFIS). The authors compare these three AFIS in terms of their ability to learn from data streams, to identify patterns and to make predictions. The paper is structured as follows: Section 1 provides an overview of the three AFIS. In section 2, the authors describe the methodology used for this comparative study. The results are presented in section 3. Finally, the limitations and future work are discussed in section 4.

Key Contributions/Findings:
The main contribution of the paper is the comparison of these three AFIS. The authors conclude that McFIS has the ability to predict data with a promising accuracy by keeping the number of fuzzy rules as low as possible. It also shows that the presence of external relevant parameters, for example, temperature variation in renewable generation not only improves computational requirement in McFIS but also shows a promising direction towards improving the prediction error.

Methodology/Approach:
The authors compare these three AFIS by using the same data set and evaluation criteria. The data set is used to train the three AFIS and the performance of the three AFIS are evaluated based on their ability to predict the STEP in an urban building. The McFIS has the ability to predict the STEP with a promising accuracy by keeping the number of fuzzy rules as low as possible. It also shows that the presence of external relevant parameters, for example, temperature variation in renewable generation not only improves computational requirement in McFIS but also shows a promising direction towards improving the prediction error.

Results/Data:
The authors use the same data set to train the three AFIS and the performance of the three AFIS are evaluated based on their ability to predict the STEP in an urban building. The McFIS has the ability to predict the STEP with a promising accuracy by keeping the number of fuzzy rules as low as possible. It also shows that the presence of external relevant parameters, for example, temperature variation in renewable generation not only improves computational requirement in McFIS but also shows a promising direction towards improving the prediction error.

Limitations/Discussion:
The authors conclude that the McFIS has the ability to predict data with the promising accuracy by keeping the number of fuzzy rules as low as possible. It also shows that the presence of external relevant parameters, for example, temperature variation in renewable generation not only improves computational requirement in McFIS but also shows a promising direction towards improving the prediction error. The low computational requirement and high prediction accuracy makes the McFIS more suitable forecasting tool for STEP in urban buildings.
