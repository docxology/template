**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Compositional Active Inference II: Polynomial Dynamics" by Michael Icart and Shakir Mohamed is a sequel to the authors' 2019 work on compositional active inference (CAI). The main contribution of this new paper is the development of a polynomial-time algorithm for CAI, which was previously known only in the special case where the prior factorization is tree-structured. In the first part of the paper, the authors show that the problem of finding the most likely explanation given the observed data and a set of candidate explanations can be formulated as an optimization problem. This formulation allows them to leverage recent advances in convex optimization. The second main contribution is the development of a polynomial-time algorithm for CAI. This is achieved by first formulating the problem as a linear program, which can then be solved in polynomial time. In the third part of the paper, the authors discuss how their results lead to new approximate inference doctrines. These are functors from categories of statistical models to categories of dynamical systems.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contribution is the development of an efficient algorithm for compositional active inference (CAI). The authors show that CAI can be formulated as a linear program, which can then be solved in polynomial time. This leads to a new approximate inference doctrine, which they call the "naive" version of the Discrete-Time Approximate Inference Doctrine. They also discuss how their results lead to a new "discrete-time" version of the Continuous-Time Approximate Inference Doctrine (CTAID). The authors' main contribution is the development of an efficient algorithm for CAI, which was previously known only in the special case where the prior factorization is tree-structured. This is achieved by first formulating the problem as a linear program, which can then be solved in polynomial time. In the third part of the paper, the authors discuss how their results lead to new approximate inference doctrines. These are functors from categories of statistical models to categories of dynamical systems.
