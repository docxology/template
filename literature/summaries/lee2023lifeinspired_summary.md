**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Life-Inspired Interoceptive Artificial Intelligence for Prognostics and Health Management" by Chen et al. is a comprehensive review of the current state-of-the-art in the field of life-inspired interoceptive artificial intelligence (AI) for prognostics and health management, with a focus on its application to autonomous systems. The authors argue that the traditional AI paradigm based on the von Neumann architecture has been successful but it does not take into account the human body's internal state, which is critical for decision-making in many situations. The paper reviews the current research in this area and discusses how the interoceptive AI can be used to improve the performance of autonomous systems such as autonomous vehicles (AVs) and aircraft. The authors also discuss the challenges that need to be addressed before the interoceptive AI can be widely applied.
