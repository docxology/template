=== OVERVIEW/SUMMARY ===
Phase field models of active matter are a class of theoretical frameworks which describe the dynamics of complex systems where the microscopic degrees of freedom are not well-defined and the macroscopic order parameter is not necessarily an average over the microscopic states. The phase field is a coarse-grained representation of the system, in the sense that it is defined on a larger scale than the microscopic variables, but still captures the relevant information about the system. In this paper, we provide an overview of the different types of active matter and the different ways to introduce the coupling between the phase field and the microscopic degrees of freedom. We also describe how using multiple phase fields can be used to construct a versatile model of cellular monolayers, where each cell is described as an active deformable droplet using an individual phase field.

=== KEY CONTRIBUTIONS/RESULTS ===
The main results in this paper are that the hydrodynamic eﬀects can be included in the phase field models and how tensor order parameters such as active particles orientation ﬁeld or polymer conformation (describing viscoelastic eﬀects) can be coupled to the equations of motions of the phase ﬁeld in order to construct complex models of active interfaces. Furthermore, we describe how using multiple phase ﬁelds can be used to construct a versatile model of cellular monolayers, where each cell is described as an active deformable droplet using an individual phase ﬁeld. Applications of this approach to modeling collective cell motion and capturing cell-cell interaction forces were described.

=== RESULTS/DATA ===
The main results in the paper are that the spontaneous creation of defects in the coarse grained nematic ﬁeld as well as observed patterns of ﬂows and mechanical stresses around topological defects are accurately predicted, see Fig. 8. This points to a strong connection between the shape deformation of cells and their active behaviour, irrespective of the corresponding microscopic mechanism.

=== LIMITATIONS/DISCUSSION ===
The paper does not discuss the limitations or future work in detail. However, it is clear that the main challenge for this approach is to understand how to introduce the coupling between the phase field and the microscopic degrees of freedom in a way which is consistent with the underlying physical laws. The authors have used the simplest possible prescription for the hydrodynamic eﬀects in the paper. It would be interesting to see if the results are robust against the different types of the hydrodynamic eﬀects, such as the non-locality or the non-linear terms.
