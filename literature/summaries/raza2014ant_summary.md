**Overview/Summary**

This paper presents a novel approach for inferring key gene interactions in a genetic regulatory network (GRN) using an evolutionary algorithm called Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). The authors first discuss the limitations of existing methods and then explain how their ACO-based method can be used to overcome these limitations. They present the details of their proposed method, which is based on the ACO metaheuristic that is inspired by the foraging behavior of ants. The paper also presents a comparative study between the ACO and other evolutionary algorithms (EA) in terms of the quality of inferred GRNs. The authors conclude the paper with some future work.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this paper are: 1) the proposed ACO-based method for inferring key gene interactions; 2) a comparative study between the ACO and other EAs in terms of the quality of inferred GRNs. The authors' approach is based on the ACO metaheuristic that is inspired by the foraging behavior of ants. In this paper, the authors first discuss the limitations of existing methods and then explain how their ACO-based method can be used to overcome these limitations.
