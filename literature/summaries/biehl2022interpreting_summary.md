**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Interpreting Systems as Solving POMDPs" by Biehl and Virgo introduces a new perspective on the analysis of systems that can be interpreted as solving Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). The key insight is to view a system as a solution to a POMDP, which is an abstraction for planning in partially observable environments. A POMDP is defined by a set of hidden states and observations, and the goal is to maximize the expected cumulative reward over time. The paper shows that many systems can be viewed as solving a POMDP, including finite state machines, probabilistic graphical models, and neural networks. The POMDP perspective provides a framework for understanding the behavior of such systems in terms of their ability to solve problems. In particular, it gives a way to compare the performance of different systems that are all able to solve the same problem.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contribution is the introduction of the POMDP perspective on the analysis of systems. The paper shows how many different types of systems can be viewed as solving the same POMDP, and it gives a way to compare their performance in terms of the ability to solve problems. It also discusses the relationship between the POMDP framework and other frameworks for understanding the behavior of systems.

**Methodology/Approach**

The paper is organized around the idea that many different types of systems can be viewed as solving the same problem, which is a POMDP. The main tool for this analysis is the Markov chain representation of the belief state update function. This allows to compare the performance of different systems in terms of their ability to solve problems.

**Results/Data**

The paper shows that many different types of systems can be viewed as solving the same problem, which is a POMDP. The main results are the ones that describe how different types of systems can be interpreted in this way. It also discusses the relationship between the POMDP framework and other frameworks for understanding the behavior of systems.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The paper does not discuss any limitations or future work, but it is clear that there are many open questions. For example, how to compare the performance of different systems in terms of their ability to solve problems? How to use this perspective on the analysis of systems?

**References/Notes**

The references section should only include a list of the papers cited in the paper.
