**Overview/Summary**
The paper "Learning in Unlabeled Networks" by Chen et al. (2022) proposes a novel active learning strategy for classifying nodes in an unlabeled network, which is the first to leverage the topological structure of the graph as well as the label distribution information. The authors' approach, called "Topo-Label", can be applied to both homogeneous and heterogeneous networks with any node type. They show that Topo-Label outperforms existing active learning methods by a large margin on several benchmark datasets.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The main contributions of the paper are threefold: (1) The authors propose an active learning strategy called "Topo-Label" for classifying nodes in an unlabeled network, which is the first to leverage both topological structure and label distribution information. (2) They show that Topo-Label outperforms existing active learning methods by a large margin on several benchmark datasets. (3) The authors demonstrate that the performance of Topo-Label can be further improved by using diverse selection strategies, which is not considered in previous work.

**Methodology/Approach**
The authors first introduce the "measure" neighbor, which is defined as the node with the highest topological similarity to the target node. They then propose a novel active learning strategy called Topo-Label, which is based on the following three ideas: (1) The label distribution information can be used to select the most informative nodes for labeling. (2) The "measure" neighbor of each unlabeled node should have the highest topological similarity to that node. (3) The label distribution information and the graph structure are complementary, and using both of them is better than only one of them.

**Results/Data**
The authors evaluate Topo-Label on 5 benchmark datasets: Amazon, DBLP, Reddit, ACM, and IMDB. They compare Topo-Label with several existing active learning methods. The results show that Topo-Label outperforms all the other methods by a large margin. For example, on the Amazon dataset, when the number of labeled nodes is 10%, Topo-Label achieves an accuracy of 0.917, which is higher than the best baseline by 5%. When the number of labeled nodes is 20%, Topo-Label achieves an accuracy of 0.906, which is higher than the best baseline by 3%.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The authors show that the performance of Topo-Label can be further improved by using diverse selection strategies, which is not considered in previous work. The results also demonstrate that the performance of Topo-Label on different datasets are consistent. For example, when the number of labeled nodes is 10%, Topo-Label achieves an accuracy of 0.917 on Amazon and 0.935 on IMDB, both of which are higher than the best baseline by 5%. When the number of labeled nodes is 20%, Topo-Label achieves an accuracy of 0.906 on Amazon and 0.936 on IMDB, both of which are higher than the best baseline by 3%.
