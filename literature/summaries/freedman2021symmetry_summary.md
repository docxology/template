**Overview/Summary**

Symmetry Protected Quantum Computation is a research paper in the field of quantum computing. The authors present a protocol for performing a quantum computation that is protected by a symmetry, which is a mathematical concept that describes the idea of "invariance under a transformation." In this case, the symmetry is a set of transformations that leave the state of the system unchanged (i.e., they are an involution). The paper shows how to perform a quantum computation in such a way that it is protected by this symmetry. This is done by using a resource state and a sequence of operations that can be applied to any pair of qubits, called A and B. It is shown that the ability to apply these operations is equivalent to the ability to create the resource state. The protocol is based on the idea that if one has the ability to teleport the state (1+SA)ψAB to a pair of qubits E and F, then one can also apply the operation 1+SA⃗SB to any pair of qubits A and B.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors show how to create the resource state ψresource(4/3) and use it to teleport the state (1+SA)ψAB. This is done by applying the operations (1  + 4/3 ⃗SA⃗SC)(1  + 4/3 ⃗SB⃗SD). The resulting state, up to normalization, is a singlet on C and D and the operation 1+2/3⃗SA⃗SB is applied. This can be repeated for any x in (0,1] to create the sequence of states ψresource(x) with ϵi = 4x/3. The protocol is based on a mathematical fact that if one has the ability to apply the operation 1+ϵ⃗SA⃗SB for some positive ϵ, then one can also apply it for any ϵ in the interval [x2,(4/3)x]. This means that the cost of applying the i-th operation is exponential in i. The magnitude of ϵi decreases doubly-exponentially with i.

**Methodology/Approach**

The paper does not have a section on methodology/approach, but it provides an explanation for how to create the resource state ψresource(4/3) and use it to teleport the state (1+SA)ψAB. The protocol is based on the idea that if one has the ability to apply the operation 1+⃗SA⃗SB with some positive ϵ, then one can also apply it for any ϵ in the interval [x2,(4/3)x]. This means that the cost of applying the i-th operation is exponential in i. The magnitude of ϵi decreases doubly-exponentially with i.

**Results/Data**

The paper does not have a section on results/data, but it provides an explanation for how to create the resource state ψresource(4/3) and use it to teleport the state (1+SA)ψAB. The protocol is based on a mathematical fact that if one has the ability to apply the operation 1+⃗SA⃗SB with some positive ϵ, then one can also apply it for any ϵ in the interval [x2,(4/3)x]. This means that the cost of applying the i-th operation is exponential in i. The magnitude of ϵi decreases doubly-exponentially with i.
