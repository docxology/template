**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Active Stereo in the Wild through Virtual Pattern Projection" by Chen et al. (2022) presents a novel approach for active stereo matching that can be applied to various scenarios with an unknown number of patterns, such as those found in real-world environments. The authors propose a method called virtual pattern projection (VPP), which is based on the idea of projecting a virtual pattern into the scene and then using the projected pattern to estimate the depth map. This approach is different from the traditional active stereo methods that use a fixed number of patterns, such as those used in the Middlebury dataset. The VPP method can be applied to various scenarios with an unknown number of patterns, including the wild datasets ETH3D and KITTI. In this paper, the authors first present the challenges of applying the existing active stereo methods to these two datasets. Then, they propose a novel approach for active stereo matching in the wild through VPP. The proposed method is based on the idea that the virtual pattern can be projected into the scene by using a camera with a different baseline and then use the projected pattern to estimate the depth map. This approach is different from the traditional active stereo methods that use a fixed number of patterns, such as those used in the Middlebury dataset. The VPP method can be applied to various scenarios with an unknown number of patterns, including the wild datasets ETH3D and KITTI.
