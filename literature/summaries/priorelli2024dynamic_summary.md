**Overview/Summary**

The paper proposes a new approach to dynamic planning in hierarchical active inference (HAI), which is an extension of the traditional HAI framework that has been widely used for modeling and learning complex cognitive processes such as perception, attention, decision-making, and motor control. The authors argue that the current HAI formulation does not allow the agent to plan its actions over time, but rather only react to the environment based on the current state. In this paper, they propose a new dynamic planning approach in which the hidden causes of the top level are used as an observation for the lower level, and the extrinsic states are updated based on the intrinsic observations. The authors show that the proposed method can be applied to both continuous-time HAI and discrete-time HAI.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The key contributions of the paper are the new dynamic planning approach in which the hidden causes of the top level are used as an observation for the lower level, and the extrinsic states are updated based on the intrinsic observations. The authors show that the proposed method can be applied to both continuous-time HAI and discrete-time HAI.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors first introduce the traditional HAI framework in which the hidden causes of a level are used as an observation for the lower level, and the extrinsic states are updated based on the intrinsic observations. The authors then discuss how the current HAI formulation does not allow the agent to plan its actions over time, but rather only react to the environment based on the current state. They argue that this is because the dynamic planning in the traditional HAI framework is not well defined. Next, the authors propose a new approach to dynamic planning in which the hidden causes of the top level are used as an observation for the lower level, and the extrinsic states are updated based on the intrinsic observations. The authors show that the proposed method can be applied to both continuous-time HAI and discrete-time HAI.

**Results/Data**

The paper does not contain any results or data.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors discuss how the current HAI formulation does not allow the agent to plan its actions over time, but rather only react to the environment based on the current state. They argue that this is because the dynamic planning in the traditional HAI framework is not well defined. The authors also provide a new approach to dynamic planning in which the hidden causes of the top level are used as an observation for the lower level, and the extrinsic states are updated based on the intrinsic observations. The authors show that the proposed method can be applied to both continuous-time HAI and discrete-time HAI.
