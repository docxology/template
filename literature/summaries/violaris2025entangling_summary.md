**Overview/Summary**
The paper "Entangling Disciplines: Causality, Causality, and CTCs" by J. A. Wheeler et al. (2018) is a thought-provoking exploration of the power of closed timelike curves (CTCs), which are hypothetical structures that allow for time travel. The authors argue that if we had access to such a structure, it would be possible to perform computations that could not be performed with standard quantum computers. In 

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The main contribution is the introduction of a protocol for using CTCs in a way that does not require any new physics or technology beyond what we currently have. The authors show how to perform a simple task with a CTC, namely, distinguishing between two pure quantum states. This is achieved by a single measurement on the system qubit and no measurements on the time-loop qubit. In this protocol, the consistency condition for avoiding paradoxes is that the state of the time-loop qubit must be the same before and after the unitary gate U. The authors also show how to perform more complex tasks with CTCs in a way that does not require any new physics or technology beyond what we currently have.

**Methodology/Approach**
The protocol for distinguishing between two pure quantum states is based on a simple circuit, which I will describe below. The first qubit (system qubit) begins in the state  |0\rangle and the second qubit (time-loop qubit) begins in the state  |0\rangle. The system qubit interacts with the time-loop qubit using a unitary gate U, after which the time-loop qubit is sent back in time to meet its past self. This is visualized as Alice-1 and Alice-0 interacting. The first qubit comes out of the CTC in the state  \rho_1  (the initial state) and the second qubit goes into the CTC in the state  \rho_1.  A SWAP gate between the two qubits is absorbed into the interaction of Alice-0 and Alice-1, so that the first qubit begins in  |ψ_0\rangle, comes out in  \rho^\prime_1,  and the second qubit goes in with  \rho_1.  The protocol for using CTCs to perform a more complex task is based on this simple circuit.

**Results/Data**
The results of the paper are two protocols that can be used to demonstrate the power of CTCs. The first protocol is for distinguishing between two pure quantum states, and the second is for performing a more complex task. Both protocols require only one measurement on the system qubit and no measurements on the time-loop qubit.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The main limitation of this paper is that it does not provide any new physics or technology beyond what we currently have. The authors do not discuss how to build a CTC, but rather show how to use one if we had access to it. They also do not address the question of whether such a structure could ever be built. This is an important topic for future work.
