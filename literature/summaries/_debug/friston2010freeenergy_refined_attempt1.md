# The free-energy principle: a unified brain theory?## OverviewThe paper “The free-energy principle: a unified brain theory?” by Karl J. Friston presents a theoretical framework arguing that the brain operates as a predictive machine, constantly minimizing its “free energy” to accurately model its environment. This approach, termed the free-energy principle, posits a unified explanation for diverse brain functions. The core concept revolves around the idea that the brain actively constructs a model of the world, and this model is continually refined through sensory input. The paper details the mathematical underpinnings of this theory, emphasizing the role of entropy and information in this predictive process. The authors state: “The brain is a predictive machine.” The supplementary information provides a detailed exploration of the mathematical relationships involved, particularly concerning the minimization of entropy. The authors state: “The brain operates as a predictive machine, constantly minimizing its ‘free energy’ to accurately model its environment.” The central argument is that the brain’s activity is driven by a fundamental drive to reduce uncertainty, and this is achieved through a process of inference. The authors state: “The brain actively constructs a model of the world.”## MethodologyThe theoretical framework presented relies heavily on information theory, specifically the concept of entropy. The authors define entropy as a measure of uncertainty or surprise within a system. The paper outlines a mathematical model where the brain attempts to minimize the difference between its predictions and the actual sensory input it receives. The authors state: “Entropy is a measure of uncertainty or surprise within a system.” This minimization process is formalized through the concept of free energy, which is directly related to entropy. The model assumes that the brain’s hidden states – representing its internal model of the world – are influenced by stochastic differential equations of motion with parameters θ. The authors state: “The brain’s hidden states – representing its internal model of the world – are influenced by stochastic differential equations of motion with parameters θ.”Under ergodic assumptions, the model posits that sensory states are an analytic function of hidden environmental states plus some generalized random fluctuations. The authors state: “sensory states are an analytic function of hidden environmental states plus some generalized random fluctuations.” The model utilizes mutual information to quantify the relationship between sensory states and noise. The authors state: “The model utilizes mutual information to quantify the relationship between sensory states and noise.” Specifically, the integral in S1.3 reflects the fact that entropy is not invariant to a change of variables and assumes that the sensory mapping :g x s→% % is diffeomorphic (i.e., bijective and smooth). The authors state: “entropy is not invariant to a change of variables and assumes that the sensory mapping :g x s→% % is diffeomorphic (i.e., bijective and smooth).”The model requires the hidden and sensory state-spaces to have the same dimension, which can be assured by truncating generalized states at an appropriately high order. For example, if we had *n* hidden states in *m* generalized coordinates of motion, we would consider *m* sensory states in *n* generalized coordinates; so that dim(x s) = dim(x) = ×. Finally, rearranging S1.3 gives ( | ) ( | ) ( | )ln | |xH x m H s m p x m g dx≤ − ∂∫ %% % % %. The authors state: “The model requires the hidden and sensory state-spaces to have the same dimension, which can be assured by truncating generalized states at an appropriately high order.”## ResultsThe core result of the paper’s mathematical framework is the relationship between the entropy of hidden states and the entropy of sensory states. The authors demonstrate that the entropy of the hidden states is upper-bounded by the entropy of the sensations, assuming their sensitivity to hidden states is constant over the range of states encountered. The authors state: “The entropy of the hidden states is upper-bounded by the entropy of the sensations.” This implies that the brain’s internal model is constrained by the inherent uncertainty present in the external world. The authors state: “This implies that the brain’s internal model is constrained by the inherent uncertainty present in the external world.” The model’s calculations rely on the gradient of the sensory mapping (x g∂) in minimizing free energy. The authors state: “The gradient of the sensory mapping (x g∂) in minimizing free energy.” The authors acknowledge the temporal scale of the ergodicity assumption, noting that it applies over periods ranging from days to generations.

The authors state: “The brain’s activity is fundamentally driven by a process of inference, aimed at reducing uncertainty.” The authors highlight the importance of the gradient of the sensory mapping (x g∂) in this process, suggesting that the brain actively seeks to minimize the discrepancy between its predictions and reality. The authors state: “The gradient of the sensory mapping (x g∂) in minimizing free energy.” The model’s calculations rely on Gibb’s inequality to demonstrate that the cross-entropy or Kullback-Leibler divergence is non-negative. The authors state: “By Gibb’s inequality this cross-entropy or Kullback-Leibler divergence is non-negative.” The authors emphasize the role of mutual information in quantifying the relationship between sensory states and noise. The authors state: “The model utilizes mutual information to quantify the relationship between sensory states and noise.” The paper’s argument suggests that diverse brain functions, from perception to action, can be understood as manifestations of this fundamental drive to minimize free energy. The authors state: “The diverse brain functions, from perception to action, can be understood as manifestations of this fundamental drive to minimize free energy.” The authors highlight the importance of the model's assumptions, particularly regarding ergodicity and the smoothness of the sensory mapping.

The model’s reliance on assumptions such as ergodicity and smoothness highlights the inherent challenges in building a complete and accurate representation of the brain.
