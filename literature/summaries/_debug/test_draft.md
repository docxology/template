### OverviewThe manuscript, “Expected Free Energy Formalizes Conflict,” presents a profoundly perplexing and, frankly, contradictory argument. The core issue lies in the stark disconnect between the stated intention – to formalize conflict – and the actual content presented, which appears to be entirely unrelated to the title’s promise. The paper’s central assertion, as evidenced by the opening statement, “This paper discusses something completely different from expected free energy,” immediately raises significant concerns regarding the manuscript’s coherence and purpose. The reliance on vague terms like “something” and the repeated insistence on a deviation from the anticipated subject matter create a substantial obstacle to understanding the authors’ intent. The lack of a clear theoretical framework or methodological approach further exacerbates this problem. The paper’s structure, or lack thereof, contributes to a sense of disorientation for the reader.### MethodologyThe methodological approach, or lack thereof, is perhaps the most troubling aspect of this manuscript. The authors state: "“This paper discusses something completely different from expected free energy.”" This statement, repeated verbatim, serves as the sole methodological justification for the paper’s existence. There is no discussion of data collection, analysis techniques, or any systematic process employed. The absence of a defined methodology renders the presented “content” entirely meaningless. The authors state: "“This paper discusses something completely different from expected free energy.”" The paper offers no explanation for *why* this deviation from the expected topic occurred, nor does it provide any rationale for the selection of the presented material. The authors state: "“This paper discusses something completely different from expected free energy.”" The absence of any methodological rigor undermines the entire endeavor. The paper’s reliance on assertion rather than evidence is fundamentally flawed.### ResultsThe “results” presented are, by definition, nonexistent. The authors state: "“This paper discusses something completely different from expected free energy.”" The paper offers no data, observations, or findings. The entire presentation is built upon a single, repeated assertion – a claim of deviation. The lack of any tangible outcomes is a critical failure. The authors state: "“This paper discusses something completely different from expected free energy.”" The absence of any substantive content prevents any meaningful interpretation or discussion. The paper’s “results” are simply the reiteration of its initial claim. The authors state: "“This paper discusses something completely different from expected free energy.”"This circular argument provides no new information or insights.### DiscussionThe discussion section, unsurprisingly, mirrors the problems identified in the preceding sections. The authors state: "“This paper discusses something completely different from expected free energy.”" The entire discussion is predicated on the assertion that the paper deviates from its stated purpose. There is no attempt to synthesize the presented “content” with the concept of “free energy” or to explore the potential relationship between conflict and energy. The paper’s lack of engagement with its own title is a significant oversight. The authors state: "“This paper discusses something completely different from expected free energy.”" The paper’s failure to address the core concept of “expected free energy” represents a fundamental misunderstanding of the assignment’s requirements. The paper’s conclusion, given its content, is essentially a restatement of its initial claim. The authors state: "“This paper discusses something completely different from expected free energy.”"The manuscript’s overall argument is incoherent and ultimately unconvincing.The paper’s central problem is not simply a misunderstanding of the assignment; it’s a complete abandonment of any coherent intellectual framework. The repeated assertion that the paper discusses “something completely different from expected free energy” functions as a placeholder for a genuine argument. The authors state: "“This paper discusses something completely different from expected free energy.”"The lack of substance within this assertion renders the entire paper meaningless. The paper requires substantial revision, including a clear articulation of its intended topic, a robust methodological approach, and a substantive engagement with the concept of “free energy” and “conflict.”The authors state: "“This paper discusses something completely different from expected free energy.”"Without these fundamental elements, the manuscript cannot fulfill its stated purpose or contribute meaningfully to the field.The paper’s core issue is a failure of intellectual honesty. The authors state: "“This paper discusses something completely different from expected free energy.”" The repeated assertion, devoid of supporting evidence or explanation, serves only to obfuscate rather than illuminate. The paper needs a complete overhaul, beginning with a clear statement of the intended topic and a rigorous methodological approach.The authors state: "“This paper discusses something completely different from expected free energy.”"The manuscript’s current form is unacceptable for publication in a reputable academic journal.
