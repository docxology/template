### OverviewThe manuscript, “Expected Free Energy Formalizes Conflict,” presents a profoundly perplexing and, frankly, contradictory argument. The core issue lies in the stark disconnect between the stated intention – to formalize conflict – and the actual content presented, which appears to be entirely unrelated to the title’s promise. The paper’s central assertion, as evidenced by the opening statement, “This paper discusses something completely different from expected free energy,” immediately raises significant concerns regarding the manuscript’s coherence and purpose. The reliance on vague terms like “something” and the repeated insistence on a deviation from the anticipated subject matter create a substantial obstacle to understanding the authors’ intent. The lack of a clear theoretical framework or methodological approach further exacerbates this problem. The paper’s structure, or lack thereof, contributes to a sense of disorientation for the reader.### MethodologyThe methodological approach, or lack thereof, is perhaps the most troubling aspect of this manuscript. The authors state: "“This paper discusses something completely different from expected free energy.”" This statement, repeated verbatim, serves as the sole methodological justification for the paper’s existence. There is no discussion of data collection, analysis techniques, or any systematic process employed. The absence of a defined methodology renders the presented “content” entirely meaningless. The authors state: "“This paper discusses something completely different from expected free energy.”" The paper offers no explanation for *why* this deviation from the expected topic occurred, nor does it provide any rationale for the selection of the presented material. The authors state: "“This paper discusses something completely different from expected free energy.”" The absence of any methodological rigor undermines the entire endeavor. The paper’s reliance on assertion rather than evidence is fund...
