**A Free Energy Principle for a Particular Physics**This monograph presents a novel framework for understanding complex systems – a “free energy principle” – by starting from the premise that systems are defined by their internal states, which are themselves constituted by ensembles of states. This approach, termed “self-organisation,” seeks to explain how systems exhibit emergent behaviour, driven by the dynamics of their internal states, and is framed within a statistical physics context.Rather than seeking to describe systems through reductionist approaches, this framework seeks to understand systems’ behaviour as a consequence of their internal objective – namely, their minimisation of a free energy function. This document outlines the core principles of this approach, illustrating its application to a particular physical system – the dynamics of a system exhibiting self-organised criticality (SOC) – and highlights the connections between this approach and established concepts in statistical physics.The free energy principle posits that the dynamics of a system are determined by its tendency to minimise a free energy function. This free energy function, often denoted as *F*, represents the system’s potential energy, reflecting its drive to minimise energy.This framework seeks to explain how systems exhibit emergent behaviour, driven by the dynamics of their internal states, and is framed within a statistical physics context.Rather than seeking to describe systems through reductionist approaches, this framework seeks to understand systems’ behaviour as a consequence of their internal objective – namely, their minimisation of a free energy function.
