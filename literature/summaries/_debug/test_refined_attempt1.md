### OverviewThe manuscript, “Expected Free Energy Formalizes Conflict,” presents a profoundly perplexing and, frankly, contradictory argument. The core issue lies in the stark disconnect between the stated intention – to formalize conflict – and the actual content presented, which appears to be entirely unrelated to the title’s promise. The paper’s central assertion, as evidenced by the opening statement, “This paper discusses something completely different from expected free energy,” immediately raises significant concerns regarding the manuscript’s coherence and purpose. The reliance on vague terms like “something” and the repeated insistence on a deviation from the anticipated subject matter create a substantial obstacle to understanding the authors’ intent. The lack of a clear theoretical framework or methodological approach further exacerbates this problem. The paper’s structure, or lack thereof, contributes to a sense of disorientation for the reader.### MethodologyThe methodological approach, or lack thereof, is perhaps the most troubling aspect of this manuscript. The authors state: "“This paper discusses something completely different from expected free energy.”" This statement, repeated verbatim, serves as the sole methodological justification for the paper’s existence. There is no discussion of data collection, analysis techniques, or any systematic process employed. The absence of a defined methodology renders the presented “content” entirely meaningless. The authors state: "“This paper discusses something completely different from expected free energy.”" The paper offers no explanation for *why* this deviation from the expected topic occurred, nor does it provide any rationale for the selection of the presented material. The authors state: "“This paper discusses something completely different from expected free energy.”" The absence of any methodological rigor undermines the entire endeavor. The paper’s reliance on assertion rather than evidence is fundamentally flawed, presenting a theoretical void.### ResultsThe manuscript offers no demonstrable results. The authors state: "“This paper discusses something completely different from expected free energy.”" The paper’s presentation lacks any quantifiable data, observed phenomena, or statistical analyses. The absence of empirical support renders the entire argument speculative and unsubstantiated. The authors state: "“This paper discusses something completely different from expected free energy.”" The lack of any measurable outcome is a critical failing of the work.### DiscussionThe discussion section mirrors the preceding issues, failing to engage with the core concept of “expected free energy” or to explore the potential relationship between conflict and energy. The authors state: "“This paper discusses something completely different from expected free energy.”" The paper’s assertion of a deviation from the expected topic remains unsupported and unexamined. The presentation lacks any critical analysis or synthesis of the presented material. The authors state: "“This paper discusses something completely different from expected free energy.”" The entire discussion is built upon a single, unsupported claim, creating a circular and ultimately meaningless argument.### Revisions & RecommendationsTo address the fundamental flaws of this manuscript, several key revisions are urgently required. Firstly, the authors must clearly articulate the intended subject matter of the paper. Secondly, a robust methodological approach, including data collection, analysis techniques, and a defined theoretical framework, must be implemented. Thirdly, the authors must engage critically with the concept of “expected free energy” and explore the potential relationship between conflict and energy. The authors state: "“This paper discusses something completely different from expected free energy.”" This statement needs to be replaced with a substantive argument.### ConclusionThe manuscript, as currently presented, is unacceptable. The authors state: "“This paper discusses something completely different from expected free energy.”" The fundamental issues of repetition, lack of methodology, and absence of substantive content render the paper meaningless. A complete overhaul is required to transform this flawed manuscript into a credible contribution to the field. The authors state: "“This paper discusses something completely different from expected free energy.”" The core problem lies in the failure to fulfill the stated purpose of the assignment.
