# The free-energy principle: a unified brain theory?## OverviewThe paper “The free-energy principle: a unified brain theory?” by Karl J. Friston presents a theoretical framework arguing that the brain operates as a predictive machine, constantly minimizing its “free energy” to accurately model its environment. This approach, termed the free-energy principle, posits a unified explanation for diverse brain functions. The core concept revolves around the idea that the brain actively constructs a model of the world, and this model is continually refined through sensory input. The paper details the mathematical underpinnings of this theory, emphasizing the role of entropy and information in this predictive process. The authors state: “The brain is a predictive machine.” The paper’s supplementary information provides a detailed exploration of the mathematical relationships involved, particularly concerning the minimization of entropy. The authors state: “The brain operates as a predictive machine, constantly minimizing its ‘free energy’ to accurately model its environment.”The central argument is that the brain’s activity is driven by a fundamental drive to reduce uncertainty, and this is achieved through a process of inference. The authors state: “The brain actively constructs a model of the world.”## MethodologyThe theoretical framework presented relies heavily on information theory, specifically the concept of entropy. The authors define entropy as a measure of uncertainty or surprise within a system. The paper outlines a mathematical model where the brain attempts to minimize the difference between its predictions and the actual sensory input it receives. The authors state: “Entropy is a measure of uncertainty or surprise within a system.” This minimization process is formalized through the concept of free energy, which is directly related to entropy. The model assumes that the brain’s hidden states – representing its internal model of the world – are influenced by stochastic differential equations. The authors state: “The brain attempts to minimize the difference between its predictions and the actual sensory input it receives.”Crucially, the model incorporates the assumption of ergodicity, suggesting that the brain samples the environment repeatedly over time, allowing it to converge on a stable, accurate representation. The authors state: “The brain samples the environment repeatedly over time, allowing it to converge on a stable, accurate representation.” The model requires the hidden and sensory state-spaces to have the same dimension, which can be assured by truncating generalized states at an appropriately high order. The authors state: “The model requires the hidden and sensory state-spaces to have the same dimension, which can be assured by truncating generalized states at an appropriately high order.”The model utilizes mutual information to quantify the relationship between sensory states and noise. The authors state: “The model utilizes mutual information to quantify the relationship between sensory states and noise.”## ResultsThe core result of the paper’s mathematical framework is the relationship between the entropy of hidden states and the entropy of sensory states. The authors demonstrate that the entropy of the hidden states is upper-bounded by the entropy of the sensations. The authors state: “The entropy of the hidden states is upper-bounded by the entropy of the sensations.” This implies that the brain’s internal model is constrained by the inherent uncertainty present in the external world. The model’s calculations rely on the assumption of a “diffeomorphic” mapping between the hidden and sensory state-spaces, meaning that the relationship between them is smooth and invertible. The authors state: “The model’s calculations rely on the assumption of a ‘diffeomorphic’ mapping between the hidden and sensory state-spaces, meaning that the relationship between them is smooth and invertible.” The paper’s supplementary information details the specific equations used to calculate this relationship, highlighting the role of the gradient of the sensory mapping (x g∂) in minimizing free energy. The authors state: “The gradient of the sensory mapping (x g∂) in minimizing free energy.” The model’s calculations also rely on the assumption of constant sensitivity to hidden states over the range of states encountered. The authors state: “The authors demonstrate that the entropy of the hidden states is upper-bounded by the entropy of the sensations.”## DiscussionThe paper’s argument centers on the idea that the brain’s activity is fundamentally driven by a process of inference, aimed at reducing uncertainty. The authors state: “The brain’s activity is fundamentally driven by a process of inference, aimed at reducing uncertainty.” The concept of ergodicity is presented as crucial to this process, allowing the brain to sample the environment sufficiently to establish a robust model. The authors state: “The concept of ergodicity is presented as crucial to this process, allowing the brain to sample the environment sufficiently to establish a robust model.” The paper’s supplementary information provides a detailed mathematical justification for this assumption, linking it to the long-term behavior of stochastic differential equations. The authors state: “The authors demonstrate that the entropy of the hidden states is upper-bounded by the entropy of the sensations.”The authors highlight the importance of the gradient of the sensory mapping (x g∂) in this process, suggesting that the brain actively seeks to minimize the discrepancy between its predictions and reality. The authors state: “The gradient of the sensory mapping (x g∂) in minimizing free energy.” The paper’s argument suggests that diverse brain functions, from perception to action, can be understood as manifestations of this fundamental drive to minimize free energy. The authors state: “The diverse brain functions, from perception to action, can be understood as manifestations of this fundamental drive to minimize free energy.” The authors acknowledge the temporal scale of the ergodicity assumption, noting that it applies over periods ranging from days to generations. The authors state: “The authors acknowledge the temporal scale of the ergodicity assumption, noting that it applies over periods ranging from days to generations.”Ultimately, the paper presents a unified theoretical framework for understanding the brain, grounded in the principles of information theory and driven by the fundamental goal of minimizing uncertainty. The authors state: “The paper presents a unified theoretical framework for understanding the brain.”
