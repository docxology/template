Supplementary information S1 (box): The entropy of sensory states and their causes 
This box shows that the entropy of hidden states in the environment is bounded by the 
entropy of sensory states. This means that if the entropy of sensory signals is minimised, so 
is the entropy of the environmental states that caused them. For any agent or model 
m  the 
entropy...
