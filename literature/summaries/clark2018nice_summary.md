**Overview/Summary**

The paper "A nice surprise? Predictive processing and the active pursuit of learning" by Friston et al. (2016) is a thought-provoking piece that challenges the conventional view of the brain's role in the dark room problem, where the goal is to minimize free energy. The authors argue that the brain does not simply try to minimize its own free energy but instead it tries to predict the future and learn from its predictions. This active inference process can be seen as an attempt to maximize the mutual information between the brain's internal state and the external world, which is a more efficient way of learning than the passive approach of minimizing free energy. The authors also argue that the brain's goal in the dark room problem is not to minimize its own free energy but rather to maximize the mutual information between the brain and the environment. This new perspective on the brain's role in the dark room problem can be seen as a form of active inference, where the brain tries to predict the future based on its internal state and the environment it has experienced so far. The authors also argue that the brain does not simply try to minimize its own free energy but rather it tries to maximize the mutual information between the brain and the environment. This new perspective on the brain's role in the dark room problem can be seen as a form of active inference, where the brain tries to predict the future based on its internal state and the environment it has experienced so far.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors' main contribution is their argument that the brain does not simply try to minimize its own free energy but instead it tries to maximize the mutual information between the brain and the environment. The authors also argue that the brain's goal in the dark room problem is not to minimize its own free energy but rather to maximize the mutual information between the brain and the environment. This new perspective on the brain's role in the dark room problem can be seen as a form of active inference, where the brain tries to predict the future based on its internal state and the environment it has experienced so far.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors' approach is to argue that the brain does not simply try to minimize its own free energy but instead it tries to maximize the mutual information between the brain and the environment. The authors also argue that the brain's goal in the dark room problem is not to minimize its own free energy but rather to maximize the mutual information between the brain and the environment.

**Results/Data**

The authors' main finding is that the brain does not simply try to minimize its own free energy but instead it tries to maximize the mutual information between the brain and the environment. The authors also argue that the brain's goal in the dark room problem is not to minimize its own free energy but rather to maximize the mutual information between the brain and the environment.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors' main limitation is their argument that the brain does not simply try to minimize its own free energy but instead it tries to maximize the mutual information between the brain and the environment. The authors also argue that the brain's goal in the dark room problem is not to minimize its own free energy but rather to maximize the mutual information between the brain and the environment.
