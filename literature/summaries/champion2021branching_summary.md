**Overview/Summary**
The paper presents a new approach to active inference in partially observable environments, which is called Branching Time Active Inference with Bayesian Filtering (BTABF). The authors argue that the traditional approaches to this problem are not suitable for real-world applications because they do not take into account the time it takes to make observations. They propose a new algorithm that uses a combination of planning and learning from experience, which is called BTABF. The key contributions of the paper are the development of the BTABF algorithm and an empirical evaluation of its performance on several tasks.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The authors' main contribution is the development of the BTABF algorithm. They also compare their new approach with a number of existing approaches, including the traditional active inference (AI) framework, which they claim to be too slow for real-world applications, and a recent deep learning approach that uses Monte Carlo tree search. The paper also provides an empirical evaluation of the performance of the BTABF algorithm on several tasks.

**Methodology/Approach**
The authors use a combination of planning and learning from experience. They first plan a sequence of actions to achieve a goal, then they make observations in the environment using sensors. These observations are used to update the belief about the state of the world. The paper also compares the performance of their algorithm with that of the AI framework and the deep learning approach.

**Results/Data**
The authors provide an empirical evaluation of the performance of the BTABF algorithm on several tasks, including a gridworld, a 3D maze, and a real-world task in which a robot must learn to open doors. The paper also compares the performance of their new algorithm with that of the AI framework and the deep learning approach.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The authors discuss the limitations of their work, such as the fact that they do not consider the cost of making observations. They also suggest future research directions, including considering the cost of making observations in a real-world setting.
