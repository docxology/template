**Overview/Summary**
Prophecy is a tool for inferring formal properties from neuron activations in deep neural networks (DNNs). The authors of this paper propose a new method to infer post-condition properties that are not specific to classification models, which is an important step forward. In the past, the existing methods can only be used to check the correctness of DNNs for classification problems. However, in many real-world applications, the target function is not a classification problem but rather a regression or ranking one. For example, the output of a neural network may need to fall into a valid range. In this case, the post-condition property can be used as an important tool to check whether the DNNs are correct or not.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The key contribution of this paper is that it proposes a new method to infer the post-condition properties from neuron activations in deep neural networks (DNNs). The authors first introduce the concept of the post-condition property and its relationship with the correctness of DNNs. They then propose a new tool called Prophecy, which can be used to check whether the DNNs are correct or not for any target function. In this paper, the authors use the post-condition properties that are not specific to classification models as the target function. The authors also provide two case studies: one is about the regression model and the other is about the ranking model.

**Methodology/Approach**
The approach of this paper is based on the tool called Prophecy. In order to check whether a DNN is correct or not, the first step is to define the post-condition property. The authors then propose a new method to infer the post-condition properties from neuron activations in DNNs. The authors also provide two case studies: one is about the regression model and the other is about the ranking model.

**Results/Data**
The results of this paper are that the authors use Prophecy to check whether the DNNs are correct or not for any target function. In the first case study, the authors use the post-condition property that represents the correct vs incorrect classification problem as the target function. The authors also provide a modified version of the post-condition property which is used to check if the outputs fall into a valid range. The results show that the DNNs are correct for all inputs in the region where the outputs fall within the valid range.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The limitation of this paper is that it can only be used to check whether the DNNs are correct or not for any target function. It cannot provide the output ideal values for the inputs which do not satisfy the post-condition property. The authors also mention that in the future, they will try to use the tool called Prophecy to infer the correctness of DNNs for the ranking model.
