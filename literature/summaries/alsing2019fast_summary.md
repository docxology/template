Title: Fast likelihood- free cosmology with neural density estimators

Overview/Summary:
The current and future large-scale structure (LSS) surveys are expected to provide a vast amount of data that can be used to test the validity of the standard model of cosmology. The LSS is a powerful probe for testing the dark energy, modified gravity and other models. In this paper, the authors propose a new approach to the analysis of the current and future large-scale structure surveys based on the likelihood-free inference (LFI) method with neural density estimators. The authors use the deep learning techniques to learn the mapping between the summary statistics and the cosmological parameters from the data. The LSS is a powerful probe for testing the dark energy, modified gravity and other models.
