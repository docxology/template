**Overview/Summary**

The paper presents an active inference implementation of phototaxis, a biological phenomenon where organisms move towards light sources. The authors provide a mathematical and computational framework for the free energy principle (FEP) to explain the behavior of phototactic systems in the context of action and perception. The FEP is a unified theory that has been applied to various aspects of cognition and perception, such as attention, visual illusions, and sensory attenuation. In this paper, the authors provide an implementation of the FEP for the first time in the context of action and perception. The main contribution of the paper is the development of a minimal generative model of phototaxis that can be used to study the functional benefits of the proposed architecture based on the FEP.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors develop an active inference implementation of the FEP for the first time in the context of action and perception. The main result is the development of a minimal generative model of phototaxis that can be used to study the functional benefits of this approach. In particular, the paper provides a detailed mathematical and computational framework for how the proposed architecture based on the FEP can be applied to the problem of phototaxis.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors develop an active inference implementation of the FEP by using the following steps: (1) the free energy is defined as the Kullback-Leibler divergence between a generative model and its true distribution, (2) the generative model is assumed to be a linear Gaussian system with a quadratic potential function, (3) the true distribution is assumed to be a multivariate normal distribution, (4) the variational free energy is minimized by using an iterative procedure that involves the following steps: (a) the first step of the minimization process is the mean field equations for the generative model and the true distribution are derived from the variational free energy, (b) the second step is to solve the mean field equations for the generative model, and (c) the third step is to use the solution of the second step as an approximation of the first step. The authors also provide a detailed mathematical derivation of the FEP. The main idea in this paper is that the FEP can be used to explain the behavior of phototactic systems in the context of action and perception.

**Results/Data**

The authors use the following results from the paper: (1) the variational free energy is defined as the Kullback-Leibler divergence between a generative model and its true distribution, (2) the generative model is assumed to be a linear Gaussian system with a quadratic potential function, (3) the true distribution is assumed to be a multivariate normal distribution, (4) the variational free energy is minimized by using an iterative procedure that involves the following steps: (a) the first step of the minimization process is the mean field equations for the generative model and the true distribution are derived from the variational free energy, (b) the second step is to solve the mean field equations for the generative model, and (c) the third step is to use the solution of the second step as an approximation of the first step. The authors also provide a detailed mathematical derivation of the FEP. The main idea in this paper is that the FEP can be used to explain the behavior of phototactic systems in the context of action and perception.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors do not mention any limitations or future work in the paper. However, the following are some potential directions for future research: (1) the proposed architecture based on the FEP is a minimal generative model that can be used to study the functional benefits of this approach. For instance, prior beliefs for exteroceptive input and the exploration of behaviors that can only be performed with the implementation of such mechanisms may provide new insights into the perception vs. action debate on the interpretation of the FEP. (2) The authors do not mention any limitations or future work in the paper.
