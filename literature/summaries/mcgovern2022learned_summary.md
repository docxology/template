**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Learned uncertainty: The free energy principle in anxiety" by McGovern et al. (2022) proposes a new framework for understanding the development of anxiety and anxiety disorders based on the free energy principle, which is a fundamental concept that all living organisms are driven to follow. According to this principle, biological systems must be driven toward occupying a small number of characteristic states in order to sustain their own existence. The authors argue that the formation of anxiety does not change this core motivation; therefore, the framework can be used to generate predictions about how sensory-perceptual and cognitive models of anxiety may arise, well beyond a static belief/filter model often applied in the former.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contribution of the paper is to describe how anxiety and anxiety disorder might form. The authors argue that this core motive toward the minimization of free energy will remain the same regardless of the anxious pathology. For example, the fact that agents are still guided toward the minimization of free energy may help explain the cyclical feedback response in which anxiety can produce further anxiety, such as the classic case in which entering a situation where panic or anxiety has been learned leads to subsequent anticipation of anxiety upon re-entering that situation, which provokes further anxiety. In doing so, the authors' framework is consistent with prior conceptualizations of anxiety, such as those found in gold-standard CBT treatments, but the difference is that they oﬀer a predictive model of how sensory-perceptual and cognitive models of anxiety may arise, well beyond a static belief/ﬁlter model often applied in the former. The key ﬁnding of this paper is that the formation of anxiety does not (cannot) change this core motive toward the minimization of free energy.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors' approach to understanding the development of anxiety and anxiety disorder is based on the free energy principle, which speciﬁes what agents must be driven toward, given the parameters of the physical world they inhabit. The free energy principle elaborates on those states that an organism would attempt to avoid in acting on their world model. If these states cannot be met (i.e., free energy cannot be reduced) the organism' internal model of the external must by virtue exude a higher degree of  information-theoretic entropy. The application of the principle to general theories of the brain is illustrated by placing  information-theoretic  entropy within a probability distribution— in which the  “ﬂatness”  of the distribution is equivalent to the organism' s model estimates of the uncertainty of its future states, based on past and current sensory data. If the organism has a more precise prediction of its future states, and a high precision belief that these predictions are accurate, then the distribution becomes increasingly pointed. Cognitively, this means the agent has a clear idea as to the causes of sensory data and is conﬁdent that acting upon their current beliefs will enable them to minimize uncertainty. On the other hand, if the probability distribution is  “flat”  then the agent has a less precise prediction of its future states (see Clark et al., 2018). By way of example, we can state that sufﬁciently long- lasting surprise necessarily leads organisms to anticipate a greater degree of  surprise. In other words, if we are wrong about what action to take to minimize free energy all the time, we will form a posterior belief of expected future error (i.e., learned helplessness) whereas if we are right all the time, we are left with the expectation of no future error; neither of these hypotheticals is tenable in real-world cognition. If we are right half of the time and wrong half the time, our model is not left with clear directionality for future prediction, laying the path for potential uncertainty at a meta-prediction level. This necessarily leads to a  “flat”  distribution regarding both future predictions and the expected error of those predictions. Given a 50-50 (or overly variable) distribution, we are left with a lack of precision as to what to act on, regardless of prior preferences.

**Results/Data**

The paper does not report any new data or results. Instead, it provides an interpretation of the development of anxiety and anxiety disorders based on the free energy principle. The authors' approach is that the formation of anxiety does not (cannot) change this core motivation toward the minimization of free energy. Therefore, the framework can be used to generate predictions about how sensory-perceptual and cognitive models of anxiety may arise, well beyond a static belief/ﬁlter model often applied in the former.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors' proposal is not intended to be an exhaustive account of anxiety (for example its long-term clinical presentation). Rather, it merely aims to describe how anxiety and anxiety disorder might form. Still, there are several key objections that can be anticipated, and which require addressing. The most critical objection to the authors' proposal might be what it oﬀers beyond other models, such as behavioral models of association and conditioning. The key diﬀerence, and its strength, comes from the speciﬁcation of the free energy principle that all systems are driven toward minimizing free energy. In their account, the formation of anxiety does not (cannot) change this. Therefore, the framework can be used to generate predictions about future behaviors, speciﬁcally, in relation to how anxiety will interact with the processes laid out by active inference for how systems go about  minmizing free energy. In doing so, the authors' model may even point to new treatment options. The approach proposed here is consistent with prior conceptualizations of anxiety, such as those found in gold-standard CBT treatments, but the diﬀerence is that they oﬀer a predictive model of how sensory-perceptual and cognitive models of anxiety may arise, well beyond a static belief/ ﬁlter model often applied in the former.
