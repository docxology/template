**Overview/Summary**

The paper proposes a blockchain-based decentralized knowledge marketplace (DKM) for sharing and trading of knowledge in an active inference approach. The authors argue that the current centralized knowledge marketplaces are not efficient in their operations, and the lack of transparency and trustworthiness can lead to the problem of information asymmetry between knowledge providers and consumers. They propose a blockchain-based DKM, which is based on the active inference principle, where the free energy function is used as an objective function for the optimization of the system. The authors also design a model of the blockchain-based DKM, and then discuss the challenges and opportunities in the development of this platform.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contribution of the paper is to propose a new approach for the knowledge marketplace based on the active inference principle, which can be used as an objective function for the optimization of the system. The authors also design a model of the blockchain-based DKM, and then discuss the challenges and opportunities in the development of this platform.

**Methodology/Approach**

The proposed DKM is based on the active inference principle, where the free energy function is used as an objective function for the optimization of the system. In the paper, the authors first propose a model of the blockchain-based DKM, which is similar to the traditional knowledge marketplaces. The main difference between the two is that the proposed platform is decentralized and transparent. Then the authors discuss the challenges and opportunities in the development of this platform.

**Results/Data**

The results of the paper are the design of the model of the blockchain-based DKM, and the discussion on the challenges and opportunities in the development of the platform. The authors also compare the traditional knowledge marketplaces with the proposed platform.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The main limitation of this paper is that it does not provide a detailed comparison between the traditional knowledge marketplaces and the proposed blockchain-based DKM. The authors suggest that the future work can be to design an incentive mechanism for the users in the blockchain-based DKM, which can help to solve the problem of information asymmetry.
