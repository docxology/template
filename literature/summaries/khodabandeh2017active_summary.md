**Overview/Summary**
The paper "Active Learning for Structured Prediction from Partially Labeled Data" by [Authors] proposes an active learning approach to structured prediction tasks that can be used in a variety of application domains such as computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. The authors' main contribution is the development of a new algorithm called Active Learning for Structured Prediction (ALSP) which is based on the belief propagation (BP) algorithm. This paper focuses on the structured prediction problem where the goal is to predict the labels of all nodes in the graph simultaneously. In this type of problem, the number of possible labels is much larger than that in the classification problems and the labels are not independent. The authors' main contributions are the development of a new active learning algorithm called Active Learning for Structured Prediction (ALSP) which can be used to solve the structured prediction problem from partially labeled data.
