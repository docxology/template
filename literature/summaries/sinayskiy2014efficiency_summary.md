**Overview/Summary**

The paper proposes an alternative to the traditional quantum computing approach based on unitary evolution of a closed system. The authors consider a dissipative quantum walk (DQW) and show that it is more efficient than the usual open quantum walk in implementing various quantum algorithms, such as the Grover search algorithm. In a DQW, the transition operators are not unitary but have a non-zero trace, which allows for a faster implementation of the quantum algorithms. The authors also suggest some future directions, including the development of new quantum algorithms based on open quantum walks and the microscopic derivation of the non-Markovian OQWs.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this paper are the theoretical results that show the efficiency of the DQW in implementing the Grover search algorithm. The authors also suggest some future research directions, including the development of new quantum algorithms based on open quantum walks and the microscopic derivation of the non-Markovian OQWs.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors consider a dissipative quantum walk (DQW) where the transition operators are not unitary but have a non-zero trace. The DQW is more efficient than the usual open quantum walk in implementing the Grover search algorithm. The authors also suggest some future research directions, including the development of new quantum algorithms based on open quantum walks and the microscopic derivation of the non-Markovian OQWs.

**Results/Data**

The results that are presented in this paper include the theoretical results that show the efficiency of the DQW in implementing the Grover search algorithm. The authors also suggest some future research directions, including the development of new quantum algorithms based on open quantum walks and the microscopic derivation of the non-Markovian OQWs.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The main weakness of this paper is that it does not provide a physical realization procedure for the DQW. The authors also mention that the current formulation of the OQWs is Markovian by design, so that the microscopic derivation of the non-Markovian OQWs will be interesting to see if this increases further the efficiency of the implementation of the dissipative quantum computing algorithms.
