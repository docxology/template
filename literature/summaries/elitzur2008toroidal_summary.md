**Overview/Summary**

The paper discusses the properties of the torus in active galactic nuclei (AGN), which is a region around the supermassive black hole at the center of an active galaxy. The authors investigate the effects of the torus on the observed spectral energy distribution (SED) and the silicate feature, which is a prominent emission or absorption line that appears in the infrared spectrum of AGN. They compare the SEDs predicted by the smooth- density models with the ones from the clumpy-density models, and find that the latter can explain the observed SEDs for Seyfert galaxies better than the former. The authors also discuss the properties of the silicate feature in the clumpy-density models.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main findings of this paper are that the smooth- density model cannot explain the observed SEDs for Seyfert galaxies, and the clumpy-density model can explain the observed SEDs. The authors also find that the 10 and 18 micron features in the clumpy-density models have a complex behavior that is not found in the smooth- density models.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use the Monte Carlo code DUSTY to calculate the torus emission, which is the dust continuum emitted by the torus. The SEDs are calculated for the pole-on and edge-on views of the torus. The 10 and 18 micron features are the silicate feature in the SEDs. The authors use the Monte Carlo code DUSTY to calculate the torus emission, which is the dust continuum emitted by the torus.

**Results/Data**

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors note that there are no easy solutions to the problem of how the torus emission can be expected to dominate the observed flux at near IR because such emission requires hot dust that exists only close to the center. But longer wavelengths originate from cooler dust, and the torus contribution can be overwhelmed by the surrounding regions. The authors also note that all in all AGN spectra are featureless. This is a striking characteristic of all AGN spectra. The authors find that the 10 micron feature in the clumpy models has a complex behavior that cannot be reproduced with smooth- density distributions. The authors also find that the relatively shallow absorption reﬂects the small temperature gradient across an externally illuminated cloud, similar to the slab case. Indeed, a striking characteristic of all AGN spectra is the absence of any deep 10 micron absorption features in 3 For discussion of ionization cones see lectures by Netzer, P eterson and Tadhunter. 20
