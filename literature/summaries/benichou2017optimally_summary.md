**Overview/Summary**
The paper "Optimally Frugal Foraging" by O. Benichou and S. Redner is a theoretical study that explores the optimal foraging strategy of an animal in a stochastic environment. The authors consider a simple, yet rich, model where the forager has to decide whether or not to eat food when it encounters it. The forager's decision depends on the amount of energy it can gain from eating and the cost of searching for more food. The paper starts by considering a one-dimensional version of this problem, which is well understood in the literature. Then, the authors extend their analysis to the two-dimensional case where the forager has to decide whether or not to eat food when it encounters it. They show that the optimal strategy in the two-dimensional case is different from the one-dimensional case and that the super-exponential decay of the survival probability in the one-dimensional case does not occur in the two-dimensional case.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The main contributions of the paper are the following:
- The authors prove that the optimal foraging strategy in the two-dimensional case is different from the one-dimensional case. This is a surprising result, as the basic intuition about the problem would suggest that the optimal strategy should be the same in both cases.
- The authors show that the super-exponential decay of the survival probability in the one-dimensional case does not occur in the two-dimensional case. This is an important finding, as it suggests that the self-avoiding walk (SAW) and the optimally frugal forager problem may be in a separate universality class.
- The authors also find the optimal strategy in the two-dimensional case by using the classic formalism of visits to distinct sites of a random walk. This is an important advance, as it allows them to extend their analysis to any dimension.

**Methodology/Approach**
The paper starts with a one-dimensional version of the problem where the forager has to decide whether or not to eat food when it encounters it. The authors consider a simple, yet rich, model where the forager's decision depends on the amount of energy it can gain from eating and the cost of searching for more food. The paper starts by considering this one-dimensional version of the problem. Then, the authors extend their analysis to the two-dimensional case where the forager has to decide whether or not to eat food when it encounters it. They show that the optimal strategy in the two-dimensional case is different from the one-dimensional case and that the super-exponential decay of the survival probability in the one-dimensional case does not occur in the two-dimensional case.

**Results/Data**
The main results of the paper are the following:
- The authors prove that the survival probability decays exponentially with time in the one-dimensional case. This is a well known result, but it is important to note that the authors' proof is different from previous ones.
- The authors show that the optimal strategy in the two-dimensional case is different from the one-dimensional case and that the super-exponential decay of the survival probability in the one-dimensional case does not occur in the two-dimensional case. This is an important finding, as it suggests that the self-avoiding walk (SAW) and the optimally frugal forager problem may be in a separate universality class.
- The authors also find the optimal strategy in the two-dimensional case by using the classic formalism of visits to distinct sites of a random walk. This is an important advance, as it allows them to extend their analysis to any dimension.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The paper does not discuss limitations or future work explicitly. However, the authors' approach and results can be used in many other problems where the forager has to decide whether or not to eat food when it encounters it. The authors' formalism of visits to distinct sites of a random walk is very general and may be applied to many other problems.

The paper does not have any additional notes.
