**Overview/Summary**

This paper is a follow-up to [1], which introduced the Renyi entropies for 6d (1,0) superconformal theories with the R-symmetry $R$. The authors of this paper study the Renyi entropies and the C-function in the case when the central charge $C_T$ is non-vanishing. The main goal of the present paper is to provide a more detailed analysis of the structure of the C-function, which was not discussed in [1]. The first part of the paper reviews the results of [1] and the second part is dedicated to the C-function. The authors consider the case when $C_T$ is non-vanishing and there are no other central charges. In this case, the structure of the C-function is different from that in the vanishing $C_T$ case. The paper also discusses the relation between the Renyi entropies and the C-function.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main results of the present paper are the following. First, the authors show that the Renyi entropies for the 6d (1,0) superconformal theories with $R$ are non-vanishing in the case when $C_T$ is non-vanishing and there are no other central charges. This is a generalization of [3], which was based on the results of [2]. The second main result is that the C-function for these 6d (1,0) superconformal theories with $R$ is different from the case when $C_T$ is non-vanishing and there are no other central charges. The authors consider the case when $C_T$ is non-vanishing and there are no other central charges. In this case, the structure of the C-function is different from that in the vanishing $C_T$ case. The paper also discusses the relation between the Renyi entropies and the C-function.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use the results of [1] as a starting point. They consider the 6d (1,0) superconformal theories with $R$. The first part of the present paper is dedicated to the review of the results of [1]. The second part is dedicated to the C-function.

**Results/Data**

The authors show that the Renyi entropies for the 6d (1,0) superconformal theories with $R$ are non-vanishing in the case when $C_T$ is non-vanishing and there are no other central charges. This is a generalization of [3], which was based on the results of [2]. The second main result is that the C-function for these 6d (1,0) superconformal theories with $R$ is different from the case when $C_T$ is non-vanishing and there are no other central charges. The authors consider the case when $C_T$ is non-vanishing and there are no other central charges. In this case, the structure of the C-function is different from that in the vanishing $C_T$ case.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The paper does not discuss the relation between the Renyi entropies and the C-function when $C_T$ is non-vanishing and there are other central charges. The authors also do not discuss the case when the $R$-symmetry is different from that in [1].
