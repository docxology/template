**Overview/Summary**

The Dark Energy Survey (DES) is a Stage-III photometric galaxy survey designed to constrain the properties of dark energy and other cosmological parameters from multiple probes. The DES collaboration has performed state-of-the-art analyses of weak gravitational lensing, galaxy clustering and galaxy cluster counts. These probes have also been combined with external cosmic microwave background data. The DES Supernova (SN) program is one such probe that measures the expansion history of the universe through the light curves of SNe Ia. This paper presents the results of the first three years of the SN survey, which observed 1047 SNe in the redshift range $0.01 < z < 1.14$. The main goal of this paper is to present the photometric and spectroscopic measurements for these SNe. The authors also discuss the implications of their results on cosmology.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The DES SN program has observed a large number of SNe Ia, which are used as distance indicators in the study of the expansion history of the universe. The paper presents the photometric and spectroscopic measurements for 1047 SNe that were discovered by the DES Supernova Program during its first three years of operation. The authors also discuss the implications of their results on cosmology.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use a combination of data from the DES SN program, the MICE GAMA survey and the VIPERS survey to determine the redshift distribution for 1047 SNe Ia that were discovered by the DES Supernova Program. The redshift distributions are used in conjunction with the observed light curves of the SNe to measure the expansion history of the universe. The authors also use a combination of data from the SDSS, the MICE GAMA and the VIPERS surveys to determine the redshift distribution for 1047 SNe Ia that were discovered by the DES Supernova Program. The redshift distributions are used in conjunction with the observed light curves of the SNe to measure the expansion history of the universe.

**Results/Data**

The authors present the main results of their paper as a summary of the photometric and spectroscopic measurements for 1047 SNe that were discovered by the DES Supernova Program during its first three years of operation. The authors also discuss the implications of their results on cosmology. The authors find that their measurement is competitive with the results from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and it is the most precise one at $z > 0.75$ at the end of Stage III. The authors' main result, which they call a "consensus" measurement, is $\alpha = 0.9571 \pm 0.0196$, where $\alpha$ is the ratio between the DM(zeff)/rd and the value predicted by the cosmological parameters determined by Planck-2018. The authors also find that their measurement is robust against variations in the fiducial settings, different clustering estimators and data calibration (systematics). The authors' main result has a fractional error of 2.1%, which is the smallest for a photometric survey ever.
