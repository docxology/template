**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Communicating Inferred Goals with Passive Augmented Reality" presents a new way for robots to communicate their goals in a shared control scenario by using passive augmented reality (AR) and demonstrates the effectiveness of this method through experiments. The authors argue that it is important for a robot to be able to explain its own intentions because humans are more likely to accept and follow a robot's instructions if they understand what the robot is trying to achieve, and also because robots can learn from human feedback about their goals. In the past, there have been many studies on how to communicate the robot's motion intent with AR, but this paper focuses on communicating the goal that the robot is trying to achieve in a shared control scenario. The authors define the goal as "the intended outcome of the action" and explain it by using an example about a human and a robot working together to pick up a box. In this example, the human's goal is to put the box on the table while the robot's goal is to move the box away from the wall. The authors also explain that in order for the human to accept the robot's instruction, it needs to know what the robot is trying to achieve. For instance, if a human asks "Can you pick up this box?" and the robot says "I will move the box away from the wall", then the human can understand that the goal of the action is not to put the box on the table but rather to move it away from the wall.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors present a new method for a robot to communicate its goals in a shared control scenario. In this method, the robot uses AR to show the human what it is trying to achieve and also to explain why the action of the robot is not just an action but rather part of a goal. The authors test their method with a user study where participants are asked to work together with a robot in a shared control scenario. In this experiment, the participants are shown the AR display that shows the robot's motion intent and also the human's motion intent. The results show that when the participants see both the robot's and the human's motion intents, they can better understand what the robot is trying to achieve and thus have more trust in the robot. The authors also explain that this method is effective because it allows the human to know what the robot is trying to achieve before the action of the robot is performed.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors first define a shared control scenario as "a situation where two or more agents, one of which may be an autonomous agent (e.g., a robot), must work together to accomplish a task in order for all agents to reach their goals." In this paper, the authors focus on the case that there are two agents: a human and a robot. The authors explain that the goal is "the intended outcome of the action" and give an example about a human and a robot working together to pick up a box. The authors also explain that in order for the human to accept the robot's instruction, it needs to know what the robot is trying to achieve. For instance, if a human asks "Can you pick up this box?" and the robot says "I will move the box away from the wall", then the human can understand that the goal of the action is not to put the box on the table but rather to move it away from the wall.
