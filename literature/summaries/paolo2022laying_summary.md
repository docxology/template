**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Laying down a forking path: Tensions between enaction and the free energy principle" by Di Paolo et al. is a philosophical critique of the Free Energy Principle (FEP) in the context of cognitive science, which is an application of the Markov blanket formalism to understand the mind. The authors argue that the FEP does not provide a sufficient understanding of autono-my and autonomy because it does not account for the operational closure of the system under precarious conditions. They suggest that the FEP has been misinterpreted in the context of cognitive science, and that the Markov blanket formalism is an enactive analogue of operational closure.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors argue that the FEP has been misinterpreted to mean that the mind is a closed system with no external influences. They suggest that this is not what the FEP means in the context of biology, and that it does not provide a sufficient understanding of autonomy. The paper provides an operational definition of autonomy based on the concept of operational closure under precarious conditions. This is an enactive analogue of the Markov blanket formalism. The authors argue that the FEP can be seen as an application of the Markov blanket formalism to understand the mind, and that it does not account for the operational closure of the system under precarious conditions.

**Methodology/Approach**

The paper provides a philosophical analysis of the Free Energy Principle (FEP) in the context of cognitive science. The authors argue that the FEP has been misinterpreted because the concept of Markov blanket, which is an enactive analogue of operational closure under precarious conditions, has not received adequate attention. They suggest that the FEP does not provide a sufficient understanding of autonomy and that it can be seen as an application of the Markov blanket formalism to understand the mind.

**Results/Data**

The paper provides no experimental results or data. The authors do not claim any new results in this paper, but instead argue for the need for a better understanding of operational closure under precarious conditions. They suggest that the FEP can be seen as an application of the Markov blanket formalism to understand the mind.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors suggest that the FEP has been misinterpreted because it does not account for the operational closure of the system under precarious conditions. The paper provides no new results in this area, but instead argues for the need for a better understanding of operational closure under precarious conditions. They argue that the FEP can be seen as an application of the Markov blanket formalism to understand the mind.
