**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Inferring Surface Slip in Active Colloids from Active Colloids" [1] by J. M. Yeom et al. (2022) is a numerical study that uses the Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) to predict the velocity and pressure fields of an active colloid, which is a colloidal particle with a non-uniform surface slip. The authors use the PINN to solve the Stokes equation for the fluid motion around the colloid in both unbounded and wall-bounded domains. The paper shows that the PINN can be used as a powerful tool to predict the velocity and pressure fields of an active colloid, which is important for understanding the behavior of the active colloids. The authors also show that the PINN can be used to infer the surface slip of the active colloid from the motion of the fluid around it.
