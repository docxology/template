**Overview/Summary**

The present paper is a comprehensive and detailed analysis of the electromagnetic field in accelerated frames. The authors discuss the classical theory of fields by Landau and Lifshitz [1] and Jackson [2], and then proceed to use the tetrad formalism, which was introduced by Mashhoon [4]. They also refer to the work of Hehl et al. [6], Maluf et al. [7], and Faria et al. [8]. The authors' main goal is to show that all the results derived from the procedure adopted in this paper are valid as long as the very concept of tetrad field and its interpretation are also valid. In other words, the idea is to project the electromagnetic vectorial and tensorial quantities in any moving frame by means of the tetrad field. The authors' approach is based on the principle of locality [10]. The authors consider that a physical measurement is considered reliable if it is performed in an inertial reference frame. Normally it is admitted that the observer is standing in an inertial frame. Measurements in accelerated frames are, in general, not easily performed. When an electromagnetic field quantity is projected in a frame by means of the tetrad field, it is assumed that this tetrad field is, at each instant of time, physically equivalent (identical) to another frame that is inertial and momentarily co-moving with the accelerated frame. The worldline of the two frames, the accelerated and the inertial, coincide at that instant of time. To a certain extent, the hypothesis of locality, together with the concept of tetrad field, extends the principle of relativity, since it relates inertial and non-inertial frames.
