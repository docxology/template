**Overview/Summary**

The research paper by Eber A. Gusmão et al. (2017) is a study of the activity and physical properties of the star Kepler-71 using 28 transit light curves from the Kepler Space Telescope. The authors use a model to analyze the data, which simulates planetary transits and allows for the inclusion of spots on the stellar surface with different sizes, intensities, and positions. The results show that the star is very active, with many spot detections in each transit, indicating that there are many spots present on the surface of the star at any given time.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main result of this study is the physical properties of the starspots detected from the 28 transit light curves. The authors found a mean value of 6 spots per transit with a size of 0.6 RP and an intensity of 0.5 IC, as a function of stellar intensity at disk center (maximum value). The results also show that the number of spot detections varies in the range from 4 to 10 for each transit, with a mean value of 6. This indicates that there are many spots present on the surface of the star at any given time and that most of them are smaller than the planet Kepler-71b.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors used a model described in Silva (2003) to analyze the data, which simulates planetary transits and enables the inclusion of spots on the stellar surface with different sizes, intensities, and positions. The stelar limb darkening parameters were simulated with w1=0.9 and w2=0.9. The round spots are modelled by three parameters: (i) intensity, as a function of stellar intensity at disk center, IC; (ii) size, or radius, measured in units of planet radius, RP; and (iii) longitude. The authors used the 28 transit light curves from the Kepler Space Telescope to search for starspot physical parameters.

**Results/Data**

The results show that the star was evaluated using a model having up to 10 spots at a given time on its surface at certain location (latitude and longitude) during 144 days of observation by the Kepler Telescope. During this period, a total of 28 transits were detected. The authors found that the number of spot detections varied in the range from 4 to 10 for each transit, with a mean value of 6. For the spot radius, the distribution of the spot radius obtained from the fits to all transit data is shown in Fig. 2 (b). The results show that the radius of the modelled spots varies from 0.4 to 1.3 RP with a mean value of 0.6 RP. Spots with lower intensity values, or higher contrast spots, are cooler than those with intensity values close to IC. The spot intensities obtained from the model are shown in Fig. 2 (d). The results show that the star was evaluated using a model having up to 10 spots at a given time on its surface at certain location during 144 days of observation by the Kepler Telescope. During this period, a total of 28 transits were detected.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors conclude that the star is very active, with many intensity variations in each transit (see Fig. 2), implying that there are many spots present on the surface of the star at any given time. The results show spot detections, with a mean value of 6 spots per transit with size 0.6 RP and 0.5 IC, as a function of stellar intensity at disk center (maximum value). The authors also compared their findings to those for the star CoRoT-2 (Silva-Valio et al., 2010), which is another very active star. Both stars present high activity considering the number of spots and spot size.
