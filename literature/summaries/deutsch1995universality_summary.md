**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Universality in Quantum Computation" by A. Barenco, D. Deutsch and R. Jozsa presents a new perspective on the universality of quantum computation. In this sense, it is an extension of the 1992 paper [4] by Deutsch and Jozsa, which showed that any unitary operation can be implemented by a sequence of quantum gates if the number of qubits in the system is not too large. The authors argue that the strategy for building quantum computers should not be to design a set of abstract operations and then try to realize them as accurately as possible. Instead, they suggest finding almost any 2-qubit operation that can be conveniently and accurately performed and composed, and then being conﬁdent that this operation can be used as the elementary operation of a universal quantum computer. The authors also argue that the best error correction strategy depends on the speciﬁc computation that is being corrected. In general, unlike in classical computation, the best error correction strategy for coherent quantum computations must itself involve quantum computation.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main result of this paper is a proof that there are no restrictions to the number of qubits in the system if the gates used can be conveniently and accurately performed and composed. The authors also argue that the best error correction strategy depends on the speciﬁc computation that is being corrected.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use the following approach: First, they show that any n-bit unitary operation X can be implemented by a sequence of 2-qubit operations if the number of qubits in the system is not too large. This result is an extension of the 1985 paper [1] by Deutsch, which showed that any unitary operation can be implemented by a sequence of quantum gates if the number of qubits in the system is not too large. The authors also argue that the best error correction strategy depends on the speciﬁc computation that is being corrected.

**Results/Data**

The paper does not contain data or results, but rather presents an argument for why the approach to building a universal quantum computer should be different from the classical one. It uses the following method: First, it shows that any n-bit unitary operation X can be implemented by a sequence of 2-qubit operations if the number of qubits in the system is not too large. This result is an extension of the 1985 paper [1] by Deutsch, which showed that any unitary operation can be implemented by a sequence of quantum gates if the number of qubits in the system is not too large. The authors also argue that the best error correction strategy depends on the speciﬁc computation that is being corrected.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The paper does not contain limitations or future work, but rather presents an argument for why the approach to building a universal quantum computer should be different from the classical one. It uses the following discussion: The authors argue that the best error correction strategy depends on the speciﬁc computation that is being corrected.
