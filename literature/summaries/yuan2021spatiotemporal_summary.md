**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Learning Visual Context for Group Activity Recognition" by Hangjie Yuan and Dong Ni proposes a novel approach to group activity recognition that leverages the spatio-temporal dynamic inference network (ST-DIN) in order to learn visual context. The authors argue that current approaches are not well-designed for capturing the complex temporal dynamics of human interactions, which is an important aspect of group activities. They also point out that the existing methods focus on learning a fixed representation of the scene and neglect the spatial-temporal relationships between objects. Therefore, they propose to learn a dynamic representation of the scene by modeling the spatio-temporal context in the paper. The authors first introduce the concept of "visual context" which is defined as the set of all possible interactions between people in the scene. They also argue that the visual context can be represented by the graph where nodes are the objects and edges represent the relationships between them. In order to learn the visual context, they propose a novel approach called spatio-temporal dynamic inference network (ST-DIN) which is based on the graph neural networks.
