**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Online Active Learning for Soft Sensor Development using Semi-Supervised Methods" proposes a novel online active learning framework to develop soft sensors that can be used in real-time applications. The authors' goal is to reduce the need for labeled data, which is expensive and time-consuming to obtain, by leveraging semi-supervised methods. They consider the problem of developing a soft sensor for a chemical process where only a few labeled samples are available. In this case, the traditional approach would be to use all the available data (labeled or unlabeled) for training the model, which is not efficient due to the high cost of labeling. The authors' idea is that if we can find an easy way to select the most informative and representative samples from the unlabeled pool, then only a few labeled samples are needed for the final model development. In this paper, the authors propose a semi-supervised active learning method based on the maximum expected model change (MEM) principle. The authors first introduce the MEM principle in the context of regression problems and then extend it to the classification problem. They also present an online version of the MEM algorithm that can be used for real-time applications. In this paper, the authors use a chemical process as the application example.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of the paper are the development of the semi-supervised active learning method based on the maximum expected model change (MEM) principle and the online version of the MEM algorithm.
