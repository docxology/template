**Overview/Summary**

Learning Spatial and Temporal Hierarchies is a research paper in the field of artificial intelligence, with the primary goal to develop an autonomous agent that can navigate through complex environments by learning from its own experience. The authors propose a hierarchical model for the task, which consists of three layers: egocentric, allocentric, and cognitive maps. In 

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contribution of the paper is a hierarchical model for learning from experience that can be applied to a wide range of problems in artificial intelligence. The authors demonstrate that this model can solve several tasks, including exploration, goal-directed navigation, and generalization over extended timescales. In particular, the model can be used to learn about the spatial layout of an environment, to correct its position based on visual information, and to predict future observations from a given location.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors first describe the problem that they are trying to solve. They note that there is a gap between what we know about how humans learn and what we can currently do with artificial intelligence (AI). The paper then describes their proposed hierarchical model, which consists of three layers: egocentric, allocentric, and cognitive maps. The first two layers are used for learning from the agent's own experience, while the third layer is used to imagine a trajectory into the future based on the current location and motion. They also propose an algorithm that can be used to learn these three types of models in an end-to-end manner.

The authors then describe the details of their proposed hierarchical model. The first two layers are both learned from experience, while the third layer is imagined by the agent. The egocentric map is a short-term memory that is updated based on the current observations and motion. It can be used to correct the agent's position in the environment. The allocentric map is a long-term memory that is also updated based on the current observations and motion, but it is not directly used for self-localisation. Instead, the allocentric map is used as an internal model of the environment that is used by the cognitive map. The cognitive map can be used to imagine a trajectory into the future based on the current location and motion. It also uses the allocentric map to correct its position in the environment.

The authors then describe their proposed algorithm for learning these three types of models. They first describe the details of the algorithm, which is called the "hierarchical model". The hierarchical model can be used to learn from experience by using a combination of the three maps that it contains. This paper also describes an experiment with this model in a highly aliased environment.

The authors then describe the details of their proposed algorithm. They first describe the training process for the egocentric and allocentric models, which are learned from experience. The cognitive map is not learned directly from experience but rather imagined by the agent based on the current location and motion. This paper also describes an experiment with this model in a highly aliased environment.
