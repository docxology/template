**Overview/Summary**

This paper develops a novel method for performing Gibbs posterior inference on multivariate quantiles. The authors consider the problem of estimating the conditional distribution of a set of continuous random variables given an arbitrary number of order statistics, and show that their proposed algorithm is computationally efficient and can be implemented in a variety of different settings. They also provide some theoretical results about the limiting behavior of the Gibbs posterior, which are used to prove the consistency of the method.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this paper are as follows:
- A novel method for performing Gibbs posterior inference on multivariate quantiles is developed.
- The authors show that their algorithm can be implemented in a variety of different settings, and provide some theoretical results about the limiting behavior of the Gibbs posterior which are used to prove the consistency of the method. These results are obtained by using the theory of empirical processes.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors consider the problem of estimating the conditional distribution of a set of continuous random variables given an arbitrary number of order statistics, and show that their proposed algorithm is computationally efficient and can be implemented in a variety of different settings. The results are obtained by using the theory of empirical processes.

**Results/Data**

The main result of this paper is the following theorem.
Let $X_1,\dots,X_n$ be i.i.d. random variables, and $\theta=(\theta_1,\dots,\theta_p)$ a vector of order statistics. Let $F_{n}(x)$ denote the empirical distribution function of $X_1,\dots,X_n$. The authors show that for any $\omega$, the limiting behavior of the Gibbs posterior
$$\Pi_n(A) = \frac{\int_A e^{-\omega n \{R_n(\theta)-R_n(\theta^\ast)\}}{\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}e^{-\omega n \{R_n(\theta)-R_n(\theta^\ast)\}}}$$
is the same as the limiting behavior of the posterior distribution $\Pi$ that is defined by $$
\Pi(A) = \frac{\int_A e^{-\omega \{R(\theta)-R(\theta^\ast)\}}{\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}e^{-\omega \{R(\theta)-R(\theta^\ast)\}}
$$
where the integral is with respect to the Lebesgue measure. The authors also show that the limiting behavior of $\Pi$ is the same as the limiting behavior of the posterior distribution $$
\Pi(A) = \frac{\int_A e^{-\omega n \{R(\theta)-R(\theta^\ast)\}}{\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}e^{-\omega n \{R(\theta)-R(\theta^\ast)\}}
