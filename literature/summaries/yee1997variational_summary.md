**Overview/Summary**

The paper proposes a new approach to quantum field theory based on the variational principle. The authors argue that in a non-perturbative and non-renormalized framework, the usual perturbation expansion is not justified by any symmetry of the action. This motivates them to consider a different type of approximation scheme, which they call "variational". In this approach, the basic idea is to approximate the exact functional integral with a trial function that is chosen so as to make the variational principle work. The authors show that the usual perturbation expansion can be recovered from the variational one if the trial function is chosen in the form of a power series in the coupling constant. They also argue that the new scheme has an advantage over the old one for the renormalization problem, because it does not need to introduce the unphysical "counterterm" and the "divergence". The authors apply the variational approach to the two-point function in the non-Abelian gauge theory and compare the result with the usual perturbation expansion. They find that the new scheme is equivalent to the old one if the trial function is chosen as a power series, but it has an advantage over the old one for the renormalization problem.
