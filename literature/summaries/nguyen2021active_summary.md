**Overview/Summary**

This paper proposes a novel active learning approach for multiple instance and multiple label (MIML) problems with incomplete labels. The authors provide an in-depth analysis of the MIML problem and discuss the challenges that are faced by existing methods, such as the lack of effective query strategy and the difficulty to handle missing labels. They then introduce an active learning framework called MIMLILL-AL, which is a deep neural network based on the label distribution loss (LDL) function. The proposed method can be used for both binary and multi-class classification problems.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this paper are as follows. First, it proposes an active learning framework called MIMLILL-AL that is a deep neural network based on the label distribution loss (LDL) function. The proposed method can be used for both binary and multi-class classification problems. Second, it provides an in-depth analysis of the MIML problem and discusses the challenges that are faced by existing methods. Third, it proposes an active learning framework called MIMLILL-AL that is a deep neural network based on the label distribution loss (LDL) function. The proposed method can be used for both binary and multi-class classification problems.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors first provide an in-depth analysis of the MIML problem and discuss the challenges that are faced by existing methods, such as the lack of effective query strategy and the difficulty to handle missing labels. They then introduce an active learning framework called MIMLILL-AL that is a deep neural network based on the label distribution loss (LDL) function. The proposed method can be used for both binary and multi-class classification problems.

**Results/Data**

The performance of the proposed approach is compared with several existing methods, including MIML-AL  [33] and MIMLSVM-AL  [34]. On each dataset and on each cross-validation, a small part of training data is available, the rest is considered as unlabeled data for active learning. Each query request data to label from the unlabeled data. Algorithms: The method in  [34]  is speciﬁcally designed based on MIMLSVM. It ﬁrstly degenerates bags to single- instance representation and then directly employ traditional active learning method for label querying (select a bag to label all classes every query), which does not truly exploit the characteristics of MIML tasks. The authors in  [35]  pro-pose an approach for active learning in MIML setting based on the work in  [33]. For each query, the bag is selected ﬁrstly based on the uncertainty (the gap between the predicted number of positive labels of the bag and the average number of positive labels of the training data) and diversity of the bag (how many labels of the bag was queried before). Then a class is pointed out to be labeled for the selected bag based on the distance from the label to the thresholding dummy label. In their methods, not only one selected label is queried, but also the key instance which is most relevant to queried label is asked.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors compare their approach and the MIML-AL  [35] method that is based on bag-then-label selection criterion. The x-axis is the number of bag-class pair label queries and the y-axis is bag accuracy or Hamming loss. From these figures, our framework appears superior to MIML-AL in terms of both bag query methods and bag-class query methods.
