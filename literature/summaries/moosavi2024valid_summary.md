**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Valid causal inference with unobserved confounding in observational studies" by Moosavi et al. (2023) proposes a new approach for conducting sensitivity analysis that is valid under the assumption of unobserved confounding, which is an important problem in many applications of causal inference. The authors' method is based on the idea of using high-dimensional metrics to measure the influence of the unmeasured confounder and is called "hdm" (high-dimensional metric). The hdm approach can be used for sensitivity analysis with doubly robust estimation. The paper also provides a new interpretation of the bounds in the sensitivity analysis, which are usually considered as non-parametric bounds.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, it proposes a new method called "hdm" (high-dimensional metric) to measure the influence of unobserved confounding and is used for sensitivity analysis with doubly robust estimation. The hdm approach can be used for sensitivity analysis with doubly robust estimation. Second, it provides a new interpretation of the bounds in the sensitivity analysis, which are usually considered as non-parametric bounds.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors' method is based on the idea that the unmeasured confounder is high-dimensional and is called "hdm" (high-dimensional metric). The hdm approach can be used for sensitivity analysis with doubly robust estimation. The paper also provides a new interpretation of the bounds in the sensitivity analysis, which are usually considered as non-parametric bounds.

**Results/Data**

The authors' method is based on the idea that the unmeasured confounder is high-dimensional and is called "hdm" (high-dimensional metric). The hdm approach can be used for sensitivity analysis with doubly robust estimation. The paper also provides a new interpretation of the bounds in the sensitivity analysis, which are usually considered as non-parametric bounds.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors' method is based on the idea that the unmeasured confounder is high-dimensional and is called "hdm" (high-dimensional metric). The hdm approach can be used for sensitivity analysis with doubly robust estimation. The paper also provides a new interpretation of the bounds in the sensitivity analysis, which are usually considered as non-parametric bounds.
