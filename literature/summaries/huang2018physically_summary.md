**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Physically optimizing inference" by Audrey Huang et al. is a theoretical work that investigates how to optimize the computational cost of performing statistical inference in the presence of physical constraints. The authors consider an arbitrary statistical problem and assume that there are some physical constraints on the data, such as the number of samples available or the amount of information that can be gathered from the data. They show that the optimal way to perform inference is not necessarily by using a maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) but rather by using an MLE with the additional constraint that the computational cost should also be taken into account. The authors provide some general results and examples that illustrate their findings.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of the paper are the following:

* A framework for understanding how to optimize the computational cost of inference in the presence of physical constraints.
* An example where the optimal way to perform inference is not by using a maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) but rather by using an MLE with the additional constraint that the computational cost should also be taken into account. The authors provide some general results and examples that illustrate their findings.

**Methodology/Approach**

The approach of the paper is based on the following ideas:

* The first idea is to use a Lagrange multiplier to find the optimal way to perform inference in the presence of physical constraints.
* The second idea is to consider an arbitrary statistical problem. This allows the authors to provide some general results that do not depend on the specific details of the statistical problem.

**Results/Data**

The main result of the paper is the following:

* In the case where the number of samples available is a constraint, the optimal way to perform inference is by using an MLE with the additional constraint that the computational cost should also be taken into account. The authors provide some examples that illustrate their findings.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The main weakness of the paper is that it does not consider the case where there are both physical and computational constraints on the data. It would be interesting to see how the results in this paper can be extended to such a situation. This could be done by using the same approach as in the paper, but with an additional Lagrange multiplier for the computational cost.

**Additional Information**

The authors also provide some general results that do not depend on the specific details of the statistical problem. These are the following:

* The first result is that if there is a single physical constraint and no computational constraints, then the optimal way to perform inference is by using an MLE.
* The second result is that in the case where there is only one physical constraint and no computational constraints, the optimal way to perform inference is by using an MLE. This is the same as the first result.
