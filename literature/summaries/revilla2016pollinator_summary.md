**Overview/Summary**

The two-plant–one-pollinator interaction module is a fundamental model in ecology and evolutionary biology. The authors of this paper study the dynamics of such a system with an important extension to the traditional Lotka-Volterra model, namely that the pollinator preference for plants is either fixed or adaptive. In the former case, the traditional Lotka-Volterra competition model can be recovered from their model, while in the latter case, the authors find that when the adaptation rate of the pollinator is fast enough, the outcome (coexistence or exclusion) depends more on the relative speeds between population dynamics and diet adaptation than on the initial preferences. The paper also shows that the coexistence by mutual invasion can be replaced by a coexistence along a limit cycle in some cases.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors first study the interaction model with fixed pollinator preference, which is the traditional Lotka-Volterra competition model. They find that when the pollinator preference for one plant is too biased towards this plant or the other plant, the coexistence by mutual invasion (the middle "P1+P2" region in Fig 2a) does not exist any more. In the intermediate range of the pollinator preference, there are two ways to achieve coexistence. One way is that each plant can attain a positive abundance at an equilibrium with the pollinator in the absence of the other plant, and the missing plant can invade and establish in the community (this happens in the middle "P1+P2" region of Fig 2a). The other way is when the less preferred plant, being rarely pollinated, cannot increase in abundance. For an intermediate range of the pollinator preference, coexistence is possible through a number of ways. The most simple and familiar is coexistence by mutual invasion (the middle "P1+P2" region of Fig 2a). Another way is when the less preferred plant, being rarely pollinated, cannot increase in abundance. For an intermediate range of the pollinator preference, coexistence is possible through a number of ways.

The authors then study the interaction model with adaptive pollinator foraging. They find that fast enough pollinator adaptation prevents community collapse by enabling the pollinators to abandon initially maladaptive diets before it is too late. The net outcome depends on the relative speeds between population dynamics and diet adaptation, the strength of competition between plants for factors other than pollination services, and on the past history of the community (initial conditions). In the long term either both plants do coexist if plant competition is low or one plant is excluded by the other plant if plant competition is high. As the adaptation rate increases, Fig 7 shows an important effect on the general orientation of the regions of coexistence and exclusion. With no adaptation (top row in Fig 7), the outcome (coexistence or exclusion) depends more on the initial preferences (vertical axis) than on the initial plant composition (horizontal axis). However, when adaptation is fast enough (e.g., third row in Fig 7), initial preferences have little influence on the outcome and initial plant composition has more importance. The effect is even sharper when adaptation rate is infinitely fast (ν = ∞).

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors consider a two-plant–one-pollinator interaction module with either fixed or adaptive pollinator foraging. They study the dynamics of such a system by numerical simulations, and also give some analytical results in the case of fixed preferences.

**Results/Data**

In the model with fixed preferences, when the pollinator preference is extremely biased towards one plant, coexistence is not possible even when competition for factors such as space or nutrients is not considered. When the pollinator preference is too biased towards this plant or the other plant, the coexistence by mutual invasion (the middle "P1+P2" region in Fig 2a) does not exist any more. In the intermediate range of the pollinator preference, there are two ways to achieve coexistence. One way is that each plant can attain a positive abundance at an equilibrium with the pollinator in the absence of the other plant, and the missing plant can invade and establish in the community (this happens in the middle "P1+P2" region of Fig 2a). Another way is when the less preferred plant, being rarely pollinated, cannot increase in abundance. For an intermediate range of the pollinator preference, coexistence is possible through a number of ways.

In the model with adaptive foraging, the authors find that fast enough pollinator adaptation prevents community collapse by enabling the pollinators to abandon initially maladaptive diets before it is too late. The net outcome depends on the relative speeds between population dynamics and diet adaptation, the strength of competition between plants for factors other than pollination services, and on the past history of the community (initial conditions). In the long term either both plants do coexist if plant competition is low or one plant is excluded by the other plant if plant competition is high. As the adaptation rate increases, Fig 7 shows an important effect on the general orientation of the regions of coexistence and exclusion. With no adaptation (top row in Fig 7), the outcome (coexistence or exclusion) depends more on the initial preferences (vertical axis) than on the initial plant composition (horizontal axis). However, when adaptation is fast enough (e.g., third row in Fig 7), initial preferences have little influence on the outcome and initial plant composition has more importance. The effect is even sharper when adaptation rate is infinitely fast (ν = ∞).

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors' results show that the coexistence by mutual invasion can be replaced by a coexistence along a limit cycle in some cases. This is because the traditional Lotka-Volterra competition model can only provide a single equilibrium, while the system with adaptive foraging may have multiple equilibria or no equilibrium at all. The authors' results also show that the coexistence by mutual invasion can be replaced by a coexistence along a limit cycle in some cases.
