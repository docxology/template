**Overview/Summary**
The paper is about a mathematical model for a person's learning and remembering process. The authors describe this process in terms of an "ignorance" that can be used to predict the probability of a proposition being true or false, as well as the person's uncertainty (credence) in its truthfulness. This "ignorance" is defined by the Shannon entropy with constraints. They use this model to simulate the evolution of a person's memory and describe the process of learning, remembering, and anticipating. The authors also discuss the implications for a person's thinking, learning, and remembering processes.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The main contributions of the paper are the following:
- A mathematical model is presented that can be used to simulate a person's memory and describe their learning, remembering, and anticipating process.
- The "ignorance" is defined by the Shannon entropy with constraints. This "ignorance" is used to predict the probability of a proposition being true or false as well as the person's uncertainty (credence) in its truthfulness.
- The authors use this model to describe what could be called a tool, which they call "ignorance," that can be used to anticipate the next step and also to anticipate two steps ahead. This is a particular case of the former.

**Methodology/Approach**
The approach taken by the authors is to define an "ignorance" for a person's learning and remembering process, which they use to predict the probability of a proposition being true or false as well as the person's uncertainty (credence) in its truthfulness. The "ignorance" is defined by the Shannon entropy with constraints. This "ignorance" is used to describe what could be called a tool that can be used to anticipate the next step and also to anticipate two steps ahead.

**Results/Data**
The results of this paper are as follows:
- The authors show that the probability/credence of a proposition being true or false does not determine its truthfulness. This is because the expected value of the "ignorance" can be higher than 1.
- Minimizing the "ignorance" seems to be useful for anticipating the next step, and Bayes' formula seems to be useful for anticipating two steps ahead.
- The authors also discuss the implications for a person's thinking, learning, and remembering processes. They show that the expected value of the "ignorance" can be higher than 1, one can doubt about it, but this is an anticipation process, not something that will be true in reality.
- Minimizing the "ignorance" seems to be useful for anticipating the next step, and Bayes' formula seems to be useful for anticipating two steps ahead. The authors also discuss the implications for a person's thinking, learning, and remembering processes.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The main limitations of this paper are as follows:
- As the authors state, it is not because we have a strong credence about a proposition that it will be verified directly. We can however anticipate it, either by minimizing the "ignorance" directly with the corresponding probability and the weights αi we have about it or planning ahead with Bayes' formula. However, because the expected value of the "ignorance" can be higher than 1, one can doubt about it, but this is an anticipation process, not something that will be true in reality.
- The authors also discuss the implications for a person's thinking, learning, and remembering processes. They show that the expected value of the "ignorance" can be higher than 1, one can however anticipate it, either by minimizing the "ignorance" directly with the corresponding probability and the weights αi we have about it or planning ahead with Bayes' formula.
