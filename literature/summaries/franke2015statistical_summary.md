**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Statistical Inference, Learning and Models in Big Data" is a report on the challenges and opportunities of statistical inference, learning, and modeling for big data. The authors identify common challenges that are shared across different disciplines working on inference and learning for big data. These include issues of scalability, quality, and visualization.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The paper does not present new results or findings in the classical sense. Instead, it is a discussion paper that tries to provide an overview of the state-of-the-art in statistical inference, learning, and modeling for big data. The authors identify challenges and solutions that are common across different disciplines working on inference and learning for big data. These include issues of scalability, quality, and visualization. Emerging technological solutions provide new opportunities, but they also define new paradigms for data and models. Making the models bigger with layers of latent variables may provide an insight into the features of the data, while reducing the data to lower dimensional models can be key in getting any calculations through.
