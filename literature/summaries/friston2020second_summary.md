**Overview/Summary**
The paper presents a study on COVID-19 pandemic in 8 US states (New York, California, Florida, Texas, Illinois, Ohio, Georgia, North Carolina, Michigan and Pennsylvania) from March to September 2020. The authors use an ensemble of compartmental models with age structure to analyze the spread of the virus. They find that the reported data on cumulative deaths is consistent with a model in which there are two peaks in mortality rates: one early peak in New York (around 6-7 weeks after the start of the outbreak) and another later peak around 38 weeks after the first peak, when the second wave hits other states. The paper also finds that the reported cumulative deaths is less than the estimated number of deaths due to seasonal influenza.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The main findings are:
- The authors find a second wave in the spread of COVID-19 in the 8 US states they study, with New York experiencing an early peak and other states following after about one week.
- They also find that the cumulative mortality rate is less than the estimated number of deaths due to seasonal influenza (0.1%).
- The authors' model is a factorial compartmental model of ensemble dynamics, which describes the spread of the virus in terms of 8 latent states and 2 types of social distancing: first wave and second wave.
- They find that the cumulative mortality rate for most of the 8 US states they study is less than the estimated number of deaths due to seasonal influenza (0.1%).
- The authors' model can be used to predict the future course of the pandemic in each state.

**Methodology/Approach**
The methodology section explains how the data were collected and analyzed. The first wave and second wave are defined as the time periods when the reported cumulative deaths increase by 50%. The authors use a factorial compartmental model with 8 latent states to describe the spread of the virus.
- The first wave is the period from March 2020, when the outbreak started in New York (the epicenter), until the cumulative mortality rate has doubled. This time period is around 6-7 weeks for New York and one week later for other states.
- The second wave is the period after the cumulative death rate has doubled, which is around 38 weeks after the first peak.

**Results/Data**
The results section presents the findings of the study.

- The authors find that the reported data on cumulative deaths in the 8 US states they study is consistent with a model in which there are two peaks in mortality rates: one early peak in New York and another later peak around 38 weeks after the first peak.
- They also find that the cumulative mortality rate for most of the 8 US states they study is less than the estimated number of deaths due to seasonal influenza (0.1%).
- The authors' model can be used to predict the future course of the pandemic in each state.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The limitations and discussion section present some weaknesses of the paper, as well as potential avenues for future work.

- The authors note that the reported cumulative deaths is less than the estimated number of deaths due to seasonal influenza (0.1%).
- They also mention that the differential social distancing estimates in New York and California may speak to regional or cultural differences.
- The authors' model can be used to predict the future course of the pandemic in each state.
