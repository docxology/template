Overview/Summary:
The paper proposes a novel active learning framework based on knowledge-driven approaches for deep neural networks. The authors argue that current active learning methods are not effective in the real-world scenario because they do not consider the knowledge from the dataset and the model, which is very important to determine the most informative samples. In this work, the authors first introduce the concept of knowledge-driven active learning (KD-AL), which is based on the knowledge from the dataset and the model. The KD-AL can be used in both classification and regression problems. The authors then propose a novel algorithm called Knowledge-Driven Active Learning (KD-AL) to solve this problem, which combines the uncertainty and the knowledge of the data and the model. In the KD-AL, the authors first calculate the knowledge from the dataset and the model. Then, the authors use the knowledge to select the most informative samples for training. The authors also propose a new algorithm called Knowledge-Driven Active Learning (KD-AL) to solve this problem. The KD-AL can be used in both classification and regression problems. The KD-AL can be used in both classification and regression problems.
