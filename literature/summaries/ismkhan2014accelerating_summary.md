**Overview/Summary**

The paper proposes a new hybrid version of the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm in which ants act as a genetic crossover operator to solve the Symmetric Traveling Salesman Problem (STSP). The authors identify two main problems with the original ACO, one being that it is not very efficient and the other being that it is not suitable for solving combinatorial optimization problems. To address these issues, they propose a new algorithm in which ants act as a genetic crossover operator to solve the STSP. They compare their proposed method with MAX-MIN Ant System (MMAS) on 30 instances of the STSP and show that the new hybrid method has better performance than MMAS in both factors of speed and accuracy.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this paper are twofold: first, it proposes a new hybrid version of ACO in which ants act as a genetic crossover operator to solve the STSP. Second, it compares the proposed method with MAX-MIN Ant System (MMAS) on 30 instances of the STSP and shows that the new hybrid method has better performance than MMAS in both factors of speed and accuracy.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors identify two main problems with the original ACO. The first problem is that it is not very efficient. The second problem is that it is not suitable for solving combinatorial optimization problems. To address these issues, they propose a new algorithm in which ants act as a genetic crossover operator to solve the STSP. In this paper, the authors compare their proposed method with MAX-MIN Ant System (MMAS) on 30 instances of the STSP and show that the new hybrid method has better performance than MMAS in both factors of speed and accuracy.

**Results/Data**

The experimental results show that the average cost of solutions gained by each algorithm is as well as MMAS, however the speed of HACO-ASA is more than MMAS. Table 1 shows the average (the number of runs was 30) cost of solutions gained by each algorithm. As can been seen in table I, HACO-ASA even has better solutions in average and for last four instances completely overcomes MMAS. Table 2 shows the speed of HACO-ASA is better than MMAS for last four instances. Also for lin105, HACO-ASA is quick than MMAS. The results show that the proposed method hybrid with these smart ants has better performance in both factors of speed and accuracy.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors do not mention any limitations or future work in this paper.
