**Overview/Summary**

The paper "A World unto Itself: Human Communication as Active Inference" by Constant et al. (2020) is an interdisciplinary work that applies the theoretical framework of active inference to human communication. The authors argue that humans are characterized by a prior for alignment, which is the expectation that others' mental states will be similar to one's own and that this assumption can guide the process of learning about their niche. This paper reviews the key contributions and findings of the study.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contribution of the paper is the application of active inference theory to human communication, which is a framework for understanding how humans learn about their environment by using the sensory information they gather from it. The authors suggest that humans are characterized by an adaptive prior for alignment, which means that people tend to believe that others' mental states will be similar to one's own and that this assumption can guide the process of learning about their niche. This is in contrast to other theories that assume a prior for independence or a prior for symmetry. The authors argue that the human niche includes others' mental states, which means that beliefs about how to act to effectively infer and align with others will have high adaptive value. Consequently, people tend to use policies expected to disambiguate others' mental states, which are characterized by a low expected free energy. This is because these policies have a high epistemic affordance, or the ability to provide useful information for learning about one's niche. The authors also argue that this means that learning likely entails refining one's set of "communicative policies" to approximate the set of policies used in one's cultural milieu.

**Methodology/Approach**

The paper reviews the existing literature on active inference, which is a theory for understanding how humans learn about their environment by using the sensory information they gather from it. The authors also discuss the implications of this framework for human communication and learning. They argue that people tend to use policies expected to disambiguate others' mental states because these have high epistemic affordance, or the ability to provide useful information for learning about one's niche.

**Results/Data**

The paper does not include any new data. Instead, it reviews the existing literature on active inference and its implications for human communication and learning. The authors argue that people tend to use policies expected to disambiguate others' mental states because these have high epistemic affordance. This is because these policies are in a niche partly constituted by others' mental states.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The paper does not include any limitations or future work. It only discusses the implications of active inference theory for human communication and learning, which is that people tend to use policies expected to disambiguate others' mental states because these have high epistemic affordance. This means that learning likely entails refining one's set of "communicative policies" to approximate the set of policies used in one's cultural milieu.
