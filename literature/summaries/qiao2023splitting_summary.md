**Overview/Summary**

The paper presents a novel platform for linear phononics in which two-phonon interference is demonstrated with arbitrary phonon waveforms. The authors propose a new type of phononic circuit that can be used to build a quantum processor, and they demonstrate the ability to perform a two-qubit entangling operation using this technology.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contribution of the paper is the demonstration of a two-phonon interference experiment with arbitrary waveforms. The authors use a novel phononic circuit that can be used as a platform for quantum information processing, and they show how to perform a two-qubit entangling operation using this technology.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use a new type of phononic circuit that is based on the concept of "splitting" phonons. The phonon splitting process is a recently developed technique in which the phonon wavefunction is decomposed into two parts, and these two parts are then recombined to form a different phonon with a different frequency or shape. This is done by using a phononic circuit that consists of a series of coupled resonators. In this paper, the authors use a 4-resonator circuit in which the first three resonators are identical and the fourth one is different from the others. The splitting process can be used to build a quantum processor.

**Results/Data**

The authors show how to perform two-qubit entangling operation using the phononic technology. They also demonstrate that the HOM dip visibility is dependent on the relative wavepacket width of the two phonons in the two-phonon interference experiment.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The paper does not discuss the limitations of the proposed methodology or future work, but it suggests a few possible ways to improve the technology. It also mentions that the authors are currently working on the development of the 4-resonator circuit and the phononic processor based on this technology.
