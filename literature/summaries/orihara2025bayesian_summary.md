Here is a summary of the research paper:

**Overview/Summary**

The paper proposes a doubly robust Bayesian approach to causal inference in high-dimensional settings where the number of confounding variables exceeds the sample size. The authors first review the existing literature on the topic and then describe their proposed method, which they call "Bayesian Doubly Robust Causal Inference (BDRCI)". The main idea is that if there are many covariates but few observations, it may be possible to get a good estimate of the causal effect by using an instrumental variable. However, in this case, the usual doubly robust estimator does not work well because the number of confounding variables exceeds the sample size and thus the estimation error will be large. The authors propose a new doubly robust estimator that is based on a Bayesian approach.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contribution of the paper is to show that it is possible to get a good estimate of the causal effect even when there are many confounding variables. This is achieved by using an instrumental variable and combining it with a high-dimensional covariate balancing propensity score (CBPS) estimator. The authors also prove that the proposed method can be implemented in a computationally efficient way.

**Methodology/Approach**

The paper first reviews the existing literature on Bayesian doubly robust causal inference, including the doubly robust estimator of Kang and Schafer (2007). Then it describes the proposed BDRCI approach. The main idea is to use an instrumental variable and combine it with a high-dimensional covariate balancing propensity score (CBPS) estimator. The authors also prove that the proposed method can be implemented in a computationally efficient way.

**Results/Data**

The paper shows that the proposed method can get a good estimate of the causal effect even when there are many confounding variables. This is achieved by using an instrumental variable and combining it with a high-dimensional covariate balancing propensity score (CBPS) estimator. The authors also prove that the proposed method can be implemented in a computationally efficient way.
