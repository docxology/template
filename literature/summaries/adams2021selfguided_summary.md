**Overview/Summary**
The paper proposes a self-guided approach for navigation in a robot swarm to achieve efficient and robust collective foraging. The authors first present the problem of using pheromone trails in multi-robot systems, which is limited by the communication delay between robots, and then describe their proposed solution based on the concept of "beacons" that can be used as landmarks for the robots to follow. They compare this approach with a previous work called "RRT-Connect" (see [23]) that is also based on pheromone trails but has some limitations. The authors' approach uses wireless sensor motes and is more flexible than RRT-Connect in terms of the number of robots it can support, the size of the environment it can be used for, and the complexity of the algorithm.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The key contributions of this paper are: (1) a self-guided approach for navigation in a robot swarm that is different from previous approaches based on pheromone trails; (2) a comparison with RRT-Connect [23]; (3) an experimental validation of the proposed approach. The authors' approach can be used to support a large number of robots and can be applied to a large environment, which is not possible in the case of RRT-Connect. This paper also shows that the complexity of the algorithm is lower than that of RRT-Connect.

**Methodology/Approach**
The proposed self-guided approach for navigation in a robot swarm is based on the concept of "beacons" that can be used as landmarks for the robots to follow. The authors first present the problem of using pheromone trails in multi-robot systems, which is limited by the communication delay between robots. They then describe their proposed solution and compare it with RRT-Connect [23]. In this comparison, they show that the complexity of the algorithm is lower than that of RRT-Connect.

**Results/Data**
The authors use a simulation environment called Webots to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. The results are as follows: (1) the number of robots that can be supported by the system; (2) the size of the environment it can be used for; and (3) the complexity of the algorithm.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The authors' self-guided approach is different from previous approaches based on pheromone trails. The proposed approach can support a large number of robots, which is not possible in the case of RRT-Connect. It can be used to support a large environment, which is also not possible in the case of RRT-Connect. The complexity of the algorithm is lower than that of RRT-Connect.
