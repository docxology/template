**Overview/Summary**

The paper proposes a novel autonomous navigation model based on active inference theory for an agent to imagine and reconstruct its environment from the top-down view pixel-observation. The proposed model can be used in new environments without any additional training, which is particularly useful when task requirements are not known in advance. The key contributions of this work include: (1) a novel spatial representation based on the cognitive map; (2) a temporal hierarchy for autonomous navigation; and (3) the ability to disambiguate visual aliases. The proposed model can be used in diverse mini-grid maze environments, which is particularly useful when the agent only has pixel-based observations. 

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The key findings of this work are that: (1) the proposed model can imagine and reconstruct the environment with a few observations; (2) it can create paths in complex environments; (3) it can use memory to navigate through an aliased environment; and (4) it is able to explore an environment as well as goal-achieving. 

**Methodology/Approach**

The proposed model is based on the active inference theory, which is a probabilistic approach that combines the top-down view with the bottom-up observation. The cognitive map is used for spatial representation, and the temporal hierarchy is designed for autonomous navigation. The agent's ability to explore an environment as well as goal-achieving capabilities are compared to competing approaches. 

**Results/Data**

The model is tested in diverse mini-grid maze environments composed of connected rooms. The proposed model can be used in new similar-looking environments without any additional training, which is particularly useful when the task requirements could be added. The agent's ability to imagine and reconstruct its environment from the top-down view pixel-observation is critical to enable higher-level inferences. Therefore, the fewer observations it requires to achieve convergence to an accurate, or at least, distinctive representation of the environment, the more effectively it can recognise a place and navigate through it from various viewpoints. The model demonstrates its ability to differentiate empty rooms based on their size, colour and shape. 

**Limitations/Discussion**

The proposed model is tested in diverse mini-grid maze environments composed of connected rooms. The agent's ability to imagine and reconstruct the environment with a few observations is critical to enable higher-level inferences. Therefore, the fewer observations it requires to achieve convergence to an accurate, or at least, distinctive representation of the environment, the more effectively it can recognise a place and navigate through it from various viewpoints.
