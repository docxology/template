**Overview/Summary**

The paper "VADOI: Voice-Activity-Detection Overlapped Inference" proposes a new method for long-form speech recognition (LSFR) that can be used in both streaming and non-streaming modes. The authors argue that current methods fail to generalize well to out-of-domain audio, which is the main problem of the field. They propose a partially overlapped inference (POI) approach that has achieved state-of-the-art results on several datasets for LFSR. The POI method can be used in both streaming and non-streaming modes. The authors also compare the performance of different end-to-end models for LFSR.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this paper are the VADOI model, which is a partially overlapped inference (POI) approach that has achieved state-of-the-art results on several datasets for long-form speech recognition. The authors also compare the performance of different end-to-end models for LFSR.

**Methodology/Approach**

The POI method can be used in both streaming and non-streaming modes. It is a cascaded encoder-decoder model that uses two separate encoders to process the input audio. The first encoder generates a sequence of representations, which are then passed through a decoder. The authors also compare the performance of different end-to-end models for LFSR.

**Results/Data**

The paper compares the performance of different end-to-end models for LFSR. It uses several datasets including Microsoft Speech Language Translation (MSLT), Librispeech and Fisher. The results show that the POI model can be used in both streaming and non-streaming modes. The authors also compare the performance of different end-to-end models for LFSR.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The main weakness of this paper is that it does not discuss the limitations of the VADOI method. It only compares the performance of different end-to-end models for LFSR and does not provide a detailed analysis on the results. The authors also do not discuss how to improve the VADOI model.
