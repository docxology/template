**Overview/Summary**

The paper by Pellegrini et al. (2003) presents Chandra X-ray observations of the quiescent elliptical galaxy NGC 821. The authors find that the central region of this galaxy is hotter than the surrounding gas, with a temperature of 0.8 keV and an abundance of 0.1 solar. The high ionization line (HII) emission from the nucleus is also very weak compared to the HII emission in other ellipticals. These results are consistent with the idea that the central engine has recently turned off or is not currently active, but may have been active in the past. It is suggested that this quiescent state may be a result of an activity cycle where the central engine heats the surrounding ISM and then turns oﬀ until the ISM starts cooling again and accretion resumes.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors find that the temperature of the hot gas in the central region is 0.8 keV, which is higher than the 0.5 keV temperature measured for the surrounding gas. The high ionization line (HII) emission from the nucleus is also very weak compared to the HII emission in other ellipticals. These results are consistent with the idea that the central engine has recently turned oﬀ or is not currently active, but may have been active in the past. It is suggested that this quiescent state may be a result of an activity cycle where the central engine heats the surrounding ISM and then turns oﬀ until the ISM starts cooling again and accretion resumes.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use Chandra X-ray observations to measure the temperature and abundance of the hot gas in the central region. The authors also compare the HII emission from the nucleus with that measured for other ellipticals. The authors suggest that this quiescent state may be a result of an activity cycle where the central engine heats the surrounding ISM and then turns oﬀ until the ISM starts cooling again and accretion resumes.

**Results/Data**

The temperature of the hot gas in the central region is 0.8 keV, which is higher than the 0.5 keV temperature measured for the surrounding gas. The high ionization line (HII) emission from the nucleus is also very weak compared to the HII emission in other ellipticals. These results are consistent with the idea that the central engine has recently turned oﬀ or is not currently active, but may have been active in the past. It is suggested that this quiescent state may be a result of an activity cycle where the central engine heats the surrounding ISM and then turns oﬀ until the ISM starts cooling again and accretion resumes.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors find that the amount of hot gas in the central region is 4 × 10^6 M, which is much less than for other ellipticals. The presence of the central S- shaped feature that is hotter than the surrounding gas is uncontroversial evidence that central heating is at work and therefore some type of feedback from the SMBH is occurring. The unsteady scenario seems promising to fit adequately the case of NGC 821, also because this galaxy is clearly hot gas poor, as if recently swept by an outburst-driven wind. From our ACIS-S data we estimate an upper limit of ∼4 × 10^6 M on the amount of hot ISM, many orders of magnitude smaller than for hot gas rich ellipticals (see Fabbiano 1989).
