**Overview/Summary**
The paper proposes a parametric programming approach for more powerful and general Lasso selective inference. The authors provide a unified framework to conduct the selective inference in both full target and stable partial target cases. They show that by using the proposed approach, the existing methods can be easily extended to any case with different choices of Aobs and Hobs. In addition, they also propose two new methods for the full target and stable partial target cases.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The authors' main contributions are twofold. First, they show that the existing selective inference methods can be easily extended to any case with different choices of Aobs and Hobs by using the proposed approach. Second, they propose two new methods for the full target and stable partial target cases.

**Methodology/Approach**
The authors' main method is a parametric programming approach. The idea is that if we know the entire path of Lasso solution ˆβ(z), then we can easily identify the region Z in which j is an element of the active set corresponding to ˆβ(z). They first re-write the conditional inference as the problem of characterizing the sampling distribution of Z, where Z = {z ∈ R | j ∈ A(y(z))}. The y(z) in this case is deﬁned as in (11). Then, to identify Z, they only need to obtain the path of Lasso solution ˆβ(z) and simply check the intervals in which j is an element of the active set corresponding to ˆβ(z) along the path. Finally, after having Z, we can easily compute the selective p-value or selective conﬁdence interval.

**Results/Data**
The authors' results are twofold. First, they show that if Aobs and Hobs are the lasso active sets with different choices of λ, then the existing methods can be extended to any case by using their proposed approach. Second, they propose two new methods for the full target and stable partial target cases.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The authors' main limitation is that there is no solution for the case when p > n in the full target case. The authors do not provide a theoretical explanation why this is the case. Therefore, it would be better if they could explain the reason. In addition, the authors only discuss the stable partial target case with the choice of Hobs as the lasso active set but with a higher value of λ than the one was used to select Aobs. The authors do not provide any theoretical explanation why this is the case. Therefore, it would be better if they could explain the reason.
