**Overview/Summary**

The paper presents a research on the flexibility margin of electric-hydrogen (E-H) coupled operation in an integrated energy system. The authors consider the uncertainty of renewable generations and propose a two-stage model predictive control strategy to improve the operational flexibility of the E-H coupled system. The first stage is to predict the uncertain renewable generation based on the historical data, and then the second stage is to optimize the operation parameters of the E-H coupled system according to the predicted value. In this paper, the authors use a case study to analyze the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed strategy in an integrated energy system with high penetration of distributed generations.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this paper are as follows:
1) The authors propose a two-stage model predictive control strategy for the E-H coupled operation. In the first stage, the uncertain renewable generation is predicted based on the historical data. In the second stage, the operation parameters of the E-H coupled system are optimized according to the predicted value.
2) A case study is used to analyze the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed strategy in an integrated energy system with high penetration of distributed generations.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use a case study to analyze the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed strategy in an integrated energy system with high penetration of distributed generations. The E-H coupled operation can be divided into two stages: the first stage is to predict the uncertain renewable generation based on the historical data, and then the second stage is to optimize the operation parameters of the E-H coupled system according to the predicted value.

**Results/Data**

The authors use a case study to analyze the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed strategy in an integrated energy system with high penetration of distributed generations. The results show that the proposed strategy can improve the operational flexibility of the E-H coupled system, and the maximum/minimum flexibility indicators are 0.0002/0.0001 for scenario 1, 0.0015/0.0004 for scenario 2, and 0.0036/0.0008 for scenario 3.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors point out that the proposed strategy can improve the operational flexibility of the E-H coupled system, but it is not perfect. The main limitations are as follows:
1) The prediction accuracy of the uncertain renewable generation in the first stage may be low.
2) The maximum/minimum flexibility indicators for scenario 3 are higher than those for scenarios 1 and 2.
