**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Active and Passive Causal Inference Learning" by [Authors] presents a comprehensive study of causal inference learning in both active and passive settings. The authors discuss the challenges and limitations of existing approaches to causal inference, including the difficulties with unmeasured confounders, non-comparability, and positivity assumptions. They propose new algorithms for active and passive causal inference that can handle these issues. In the active setting, they introduce a novel algorithm called Causal Thompson Sampling (TSC) which is an adaptation of the well-known Thompson sampling algorithm to the problem of causal inference. The authors also discuss how to apply TSC in the case where there are unmeasured confounders and propose a new algorithm for this scenario. In the passive setting, they introduce a novel algorithm called Causal Weighted Matching (CWM) which is an adaptation of the well-known weighted matching algorithm to the problem of causal inference. The authors also discuss how to apply CWM in the case where there are unmeasured confounders and propose a new algorithm for this scenario. 

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of the paper are threefold. First, they introduce a novel active learning algorithm called TSC which is an adaptation of the Thompson sampling algorithm to the problem of causal inference. The authors also discuss how to apply TSC in the case where there are unmeasured confounders and propose a new algorithm for this scenario. Second, they present a novel passive learning algorithm called CWM which is an adaptation of the well-known weighted matching algorithm to the problem of causal inference. Third, they discuss how to apply CWM in the case where there are unmeasured confounders and propose a new algorithm for this scenario.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors first describe the existing approaches to active and passive causal learning. They also present the challenges with these approaches. Then, they introduce their proposed algorithms. In the active setting, they first discuss the Thompson sampling algorithm which is an adaptive process that can be used in a variety of applications such as multi-armed bandit problems, online advertising, and recommendation systems. The authors then describe how to apply TSC in the case where there are unmeasured confounders and propose a new algorithm for this scenario.

**Results/Data**

The authors present several experiments to test their proposed algorithms. In the first experiment, they compare the performance of CWM with other existing passive causal learning algorithms. They also compare the performance of TSC with other existing active causal learning algorithms. The results show that both CWM and TSC outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of the accuracy and efficiency.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors discuss several limitations of their proposed algorithms. First, they mention that the current approach to handle unmeasured confounders is not very effective. Second, they mention that the current approaches do not consider the problem of non-comparability. Third, they mention that the current approaches assume positivity which may not be true in many cases. The authors also discuss the future work.
