**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Fast and Scalable Signal Inference for Active Robust" by [Authors] is a research on active robustness in the field of robotics. The authors present an approach to improve the signal inference of the robot's perception system, which is critical for the success of the subterranean challenge. The main contributions are as follows.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

In this paper, the authors propose a new method called FIG-OP to solve the problem of exploration in challenging large-scale underground environments with limited time budget. They first present the state-of-the-art approach and its limitations. Then they introduce their proposed algorithm, which is an improvement over the existing one. The main idea is that the robot can use the information from the past observations to make better decisions for the future exploration. In this paper, the authors also compare the performance of the proposed method with the state-of-the-art approach and show the effectiveness of the proposed method.
