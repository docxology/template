**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Statistical inference with probabilistic graphical models" by [Authors] (Year) is a comprehensive review of the statistical inference techniques for probabilistic graphical models. The authors provide an overview of the current state-of-the-art in this area, and discuss the challenges that are faced when using these models to make statistical inference. They also describe the methods used to solve these problems.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The paper is organized into two main parts: the first part discusses the statistical inference for probabilistic graphical models with known structures (i.e., the graph structure is given), and the second part discusses the statistical inference when the underlying graph structure is unknown. The authors discuss the methods that are used to solve these problems, and provide a summary of the current state-of-the-art in this area.

**Methodology/Approach**

The first part of the paper focuses on the statistical inference for probabilistic graphical models with known structures (i.e., the graph structure is given). The authors describe the methods that are used to make statistical inference. They also discuss the challenges that are faced when using these models to make statistical inference.

**Results/Data**

The second part of the paper discusses the statistical inference when the underlying graph structure is unknown. The authors describe the methods that are used to solve this problem, and provide a summary of the current state-of-the-art in this area.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors also discuss the challenges that are faced when using probabilistic graphical models to make statistical inference. They also point out the future work directions for these problems.
