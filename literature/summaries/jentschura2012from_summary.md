**Overview/Summary**

The paper discusses a candidate for a unified description of both neutrinos and dark matter in the context of the standard model of particle physics. The authors consider a generalized Dirac equation with an arbitrary mass function $m$ that is independent of the momentum, which can be used to describe various types of particles including tachyons (particles moving faster than light). They show that the usual massive neutrinos and the hypothetical tachyonic ones are two limiting cases of this more general theory. The authors also discuss a possibility for the existence of tachyonic neutrinos in the context of the standard model, and argue that if they exist, the vacuum would be Lorentz-invariant but not stable. A possible solution to this problem is either to perform a Lorentz transformation on the vacuum state or to keep the vacuum state as it is and use only the space-time arguments $k$ and $x$. The authors also discuss three main arguments against tachyonic neutrinos, which are the existence of the Lorentz-invariant vacuum state, the role of states with $|{\bf k}|<m$, and the physical interpretation of the conserved Noether current. They argue that one can solve the problem in two ways: either to perform a Lorentz transformation on the vacuum state or to keep the vacuum state as it is and use only the space-time arguments $k$ and $x$. The authors also discuss three main arguments against tachyonic neutrinos, which are the existence of the Lorentz-invariant vacuum state, the role of states with $|{\bf k}|<m$, and the physical interpretation of the conserved Noether current.
