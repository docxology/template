**Overview/Summary**
The paper "Active Inference in String Diagrams: A Categorical Semantics for Quantum Mechanics" by Coecke and Vicary is a seminal work that introduces the notion of active inference to the string diagram framework, which is a graphical representation of the category of cobordisms. The authors provide a categorical semantics for quantum mechanics based on the idea that an observer's knowledge about a physical system can be represented as a context. This paper is a summary of the original research article.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The main contribution of this work is to introduce active inference in the string diagram framework, which extends the previous work by Mackaay and Vicary (2017). The authors show that the category of cobordisms with one input and two outputs, as well as the category of cobordisms with one input and many outputs, can be described using a graphical calculus. This is achieved by introducing the notion of a "string diagram" which is a graph whose vertices are labelled by a set of objects called "types", and where the edges are labelled by a set of morphisms between these types. The authors also show that this graphical calculus has a natural interpretation in terms of the category of cobordisms. This paper is a summary of the original research article.

**Methodology/Approach**
The approach of this work is to introduce the string diagram framework, and then to use it to describe the categories of cobordisms with one input and two outputs, as well as the category of cobordisms with one input and many outputs. The authors also show that these categories can be described using a graphical calculus. This is achieved by introducing the notion of a "string diagram" which is a graph whose vertices are labelled by a set of objects called "types", and where the edges are labelled by a set of morphisms between these types. The authors also show that this graphical calculus has a natural interpretation in terms of the category of cobordisms.

**Results/Data**
The main results of this work are the following two theorems, which describe the categories of cobordisms with one input and many outputs, as well as the category of cobordisms with one input and two outputs. The first theorem is that these categories can be described using a graphical calculus. This is achieved by introducing the notion of a "string diagram" which is a graph whose vertices are labelled by a set of objects called "types", and where the edges are labelled by a set of morphisms between these types. The authors also show that this graphical calculus has a natural interpretation in terms of the category of cobordisms.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The main difference between the two update procedures is that by definition Jeffrey updating forms a probability channel inO  (wheneverM|O is a channel, i.e. M has full support over O). In contrast, the normalisation over o in Pearl updating means that it does not form a channel in O. The two update procedures can also be characterised by the following respective properties. For a generative model M over S, Jeffrey updating minimises the KL- divergence between o and the marginal on O of the updated model in which we replace the prior with the posterior (left-hand below). Pearl updating instead has the property that it maximizes the expected value of the function o (right-hand below).
The PP literature has mostly focused on updating with respect to sharp observations, in which the two notions coincide. It is an interesting question for the future to determine which (if either) form of updating is most natural in Bayesian models of cognition.
