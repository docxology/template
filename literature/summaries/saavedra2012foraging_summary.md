**Overview/Summary**

The paper presents a novel approach to understanding how traders make foraging decisions in an online trading environment, where they are faced with multiple stocks and the opportunity to exploit the market by making repeated trades of the same stock or explore other stocks. The authors use data from the 2012-2015 period on the online trading platform Quantopian, which is a platform that allows users to develop and test their own trading strategies in a simulated environment. They find that traders' foraging choices are not random, but rather they tend to choose between exploration and exploitation. Exploration refers to making repeated trades of different stocks, while exploitation refers to making multiple trades of the same stock. The authors also find that the number of patches (i.e., sequences of transactions) is positively correlated with the total number of transactions a trader makes in a day and negatively correlated with the average number of transactions per patch. The authors use this data to study how traders' foraging choices are related to their daily short-term returns, which they define as the sum of all the negative or positive returns from each transaction. They also find that there is an optimal pattern for jointly maximizing these two measures.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The paper makes several key contributions. First, it shows that traders' foraging choices are not random and that they tend to choose between exploration and exploitation. This is important because the authors use this data to study how traders' foraging choices are related to their daily short-term returns, which they define as the sum of all the negative or positive returns from each transaction. The authors also find that there is an optimal pattern for jointly maximizing these two measures. Second, it shows that traders tend to choose between exploration and exploitation rather than a random mix of both. This is important because this has implications for how one should interpret the relationship between their foraging choices and daily short-term returns. Third, it finds that the number of patches (i.e., sequences of transactions) is positively correlated with the total number of transactions a trader makes in a day and negatively correlated with the average number of transactions per patch. This is important because this has implications for how one should interpret the relationship between their foraging choices and daily short-term returns.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use data from the 2012-2015 period on the online trading platform Quantopian, which is a platform that allows users to develop and test their own trading strategies in a simulated environment. The data are based on actual trades made by real traders who have accounts on the platform. The authors find that there is an optimal pattern for jointly maximizing the two measures they study: the number of patches (i.e., sequences of transactions) and the daily short-term returns, which they define as the sum of all the negative or positive returns from each transaction. This is important because this has implications for how one should interpret the relationship between their foraging choices and these two measures.

**Results/Data**

The authors find that there are 30 traders in the data set who make more than 10 transactions per day, which is a lot of activity. The average number of patches (i.e., sequences of transactions) per trader is 3.8. They also find that the average number of transactions per patch is 2.6. This means that there are some traders who only make one or two trades in a day and others who make more than ten. The authors use this data to study how traders' foraging choices are related to their daily short-term returns, which they define as the sum of all the negative or positive returns from each transaction. They also find that there is an optimal pattern for jointly maximizing these two measures.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors do not discuss any limitations of their study in this paper. However, it would be important to note that the data are based on a simulated environment and that the traders' choices may not reflect real market conditions. This could be addressed by using data from other sources such as the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ. The authors do not discuss any future work in the paper.

The paper does not include any references, which is typical for an overview of a scientific research paper.
