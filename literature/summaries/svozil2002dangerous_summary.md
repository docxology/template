**Overview/Summary**

The paper is a critical review of Sir Karl Raimund Popper's philosophical thoughts and their impact on science. The author argues that the high esteem for Popper in both political and scientific circles cannot be explained by his "so-solutions to the problems of induction" alone, as these are self-evident statements. Instead, it is suggested that many of Popper's ideas have a high marketing value: they may be wise to agree with officially while pursuing other goals, both politically and scientifically. The paper also questions the usefulness of the thoughts of Sir Karl Raimund Popper in general. It is concluded that any kind of generally applicable demarcation criterion between proper science and "pseudo-science" will eventually turn out to be a red herring. In the same category are attempts to implement Occam's razor as a criterion, or the radical operationalism of Percy Bridgman.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The paper is not a traditional research paper with new results in the sense that it does not present any original work. Instead, it is an evaluation of the thoughts and ideas presented by Sir Karl Raimund Popper.
