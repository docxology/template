**Overview/Summary**

The paper presents a novel approach to realize active inference in a cell's environment by using an antagonistic memory molecule (AMM) system. The AMM is based on the Lotka-Volterra (LV) oscillation model, which is a well-known mathematical model for a chemical reaction where the production rate of the output substance P is controlled by the concentration of the nutrient A. In this paper, the LV parameter k1 and the albedo are actively controlled to realize a process of observation → belief update → action optimization. The authors propose two different approaches: an early algorithmic approach (heuristic model) and a chemically plausible implementation (Antagonistic Memory Molecule Model). The heuristic model is based on conditional "if-then" logic, where the cell's temperature is adjusted according to the trend of the production rate of P. In this approach, the albedo is designed to oscillate within a narrow range, allowing for fine-tuning of the cell temperature (e.g., within 1–2 °C). The authors also propose an early algorithmic approach that was considered during the model's development. This conceptual goal is achieved by having the cell "explore" its environment via the oscillations in the production rate of P. An adjustment loop then modifies the cell's albedo and the LV parameter k1 based on the outcome of this exploration. The entire process operates under the key premise that the cell has no explicit knowledge of its own temperature or the optimal temperature Topt. This is achieved by having the cell "explore" its environment via the oscillations in the production rate of P. An adjustment loop then modifies the cell's albedo and the LV parameter k1 based on the outcome of this exploration. The heuristic model assumes a unimodal fitness landscape with a single optimal temperature. If multiple local maxima existed, a mechanism to introduce stochasticity would be necessary to escape them; however, this feature was not included in this conceptual model.
