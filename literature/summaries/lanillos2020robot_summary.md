**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Robot self/other distinction: active inference meets neural coding" presents a novel approach to understanding the concept of self and other in robots based on the framework of active inference. The authors propose that the robot's ability to make predictions about its own state or another object is an important aspect for it to be able to distinguish between itself and others, which they call "self/other distinction". This paper focuses on how a robot can learn this self/other distinction by using the concept of active inference. The authors show that the self/other distinction in robots is not just about whether the robot is making predictions about its own state or another object's state, but also about whether it is able to make accurate predictions. This paper is organized as follows: first, the authors discuss the importance of the self/other distinction and how active inference can be used for this purpose; second, they introduce a new approach based on active inference that enables robots to learn the self/other distinction by using sensorimotor contingencies; third, the authors describe the methodology and results of their experiments; fourth, they discuss the limitations and future work. The paper is concluded with a summary.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this paper are: (1) the concept of self/other distinction in robots based on active inference, which is different from the traditional "self" vs. "other" classification; (2) an approach to learn the self/other distinction by using sensorimotor contingencies; and (3) a study that shows the effectiveness of this new approach.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors first introduce the concept of active inference, which is based on the idea that the brain makes predictions about its own state or another object's state. The self/other distinction in robots is not just whether the robot is making predictions about its own state or another object's state, but also about whether it is able to make accurate predictions. The authors then propose an approach for a robot to learn this self/other distinction by using sensorimotor contingencies. This new approach is based on the idea that the robot can learn the self/other distinction if it can predict its own state or another object's state accurately. The authors also introduce a novel method, called "active inference body perception", which is used to enable robots to make predictions about their own state and another object's state by using sensorimotor contingencies. This new approach is based on the idea that the robot can learn the self/other distinction if it can predict its own state or another object's state accurately. The authors also describe a study that shows the effectiveness of this new approach.

**Results/Data**

The results show that the proposed method is effective for robots to learn the self/other distinction by using sensorimotor contingencies. The paper concludes with a summary.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The limitations and future work are: (1) the authors only discuss the effectiveness of this new approach in the context of robot body perception; (2) it is not clear whether the proposed method can be used for other types of self/other distinction, such as the "self" vs. "other" classification; and (3) the paper does not provide a detailed discussion about the limitations of the proposed method.
