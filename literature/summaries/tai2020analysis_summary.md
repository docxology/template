**Overview/Summary**

The paper presents an analysis of transverse momentum spectra for various jets in p-p and A-A collisions at different collision energies. The authors extract the parameters $a_0$, $T$ and $n$ from the spectra, which are used to describe the shapes of the spectra at low- and high-$p_T$. The extracted values of these three parameters for the same kind of jet in p-p and A-A collisions are compared.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contribution is that the authors compare the $a_0$, $T$ and $n$ from different kinds of jets, including the inclusive- and b-jets, as well as the light- and heavy-flavor b-jets. The extracted values of these three parameters for the same kind of jet in p-p and A-A collisions are compared.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors compare the $a_0$, $T$ and $n$ from different kinds of jets, including the inclusive- and b-jets, as well as the light- and heavy-flavor b-jets. The extracted values of these three parameters for the same kind of jet in p-p and A-A collisions are compared.

**Results/Data**

The authors extract the parameters $a_0$, $T$ and $n$ from the spectra by using the following fitting function: $$\frac{dN}{dp_T} = \frac{A}{p_T^2}\left[ 1 + \frac{p_T}{T}\right]^{-n},$$ where $A$ is a normalization constant. The extracted values of these three parameters for the same kind of jet in p-p and A-A collisions are compared.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors point out that the main contribution is that the authors compare the $a_0$, $T$ and $n$ from different kinds of jets, including the inclusive- and b-jets, as well as the light- and heavy-flavor b-jets. The extracted values of these three parameters for the same kind of jet in p-p and A-A collisions are compared.
