**Overview/Summary**
ProjectQ is an open source software framework for quantum computing (QC) that provides a common interface to various backends and supports the development of high-level programming languages for QC. The main goal of this project is to provide a platform for researchers, developers, and users to write, run, and debug their own quantum programs on different platforms with minimal effort. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of ProjectQ, which includes the core architecture, the C++ framework, and the Python interface.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The key contributions of this work are threefold. First, it is an open source project that can be used to develop high-level programming languages for QC. Second, the C++ framework provides a common interface to various backends. Third, the Python interface makes it easy for users to write and run their own quantum programs.

**Methodology/Approach**
The core architecture of ProjectQ is based on the concept of meta-instruction. The C++ framework is designed to be extensible and can support different backends. The Python interface is a high-level programming language that makes it easy for users to write and run their own quantum programs. The design and implementation of the C++ framework are described in this paper.

**Results/Data**
The results of this work include the C++ framework, which provides a common interface to various backends, and the Python interface, which is a high-level programming language that makes it easy for users to write and run their own quantum programs. The design and implementation of the C++ framework are described in this paper.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The limitations of this work include that the current version of ProjectQ only supports the C++ framework and the Python interface, which is a high-level programming language. In the future, we will implement more backends for different platforms. The design and implementation of the C++ framework are described in this paper.
