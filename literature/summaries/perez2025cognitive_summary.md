**Overview/Summary**
The two-step task is a well-known paradigm in decision-making research where participants are first presented with an initial choice and then asked to revise their choice based on additional information. In this paper, the authors investigate whether humans primarily use model-based or model-free inference in the two-step task. The two-step task has been used as a tool for studying human decision making in various domains such as economics, psychology, and neuroscience. The authors' previous work shows that the drift-diffusion model (DDM) is a good choice to describe the human behavior in this paradigm. In this paper, they further investigate the DDM by using the two-step task with reaction times and comparing it with the active inference (AI) framework. The AI framework is based on the free energy principle which says that the brain's goal is to minimize its own uncertainty. The authors' previous work shows that the DDM and the AI are equivalent in the two-step task, but they do not know whether this is true for other problems. They also investigate how the cognitive effort, which is the amount of mental resources required to perform a decision, changes with the two-step task. In the first step of the two-step task, the participants are presented with an initial choice and then asked to revise their choice based on additional information. The second step of the two-step task is that the participants are asked to make another choice after they have been given more information. The authors compare the DDM with the AI in this paradigm by using the free energy principle. They also investigate how the cognitive effort changes with the two-step task.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The main finding of this paper is that the DDM and the AI are equivalent in the two-step task, but not for other problems. The authors' previous work shows that the DDM and the AI are equivalent in the two-step task by using the free energy principle. This means that the DDM and the AI have the same choice rule and the same cognitive effort. In this paper, they also investigate how the cognitive effort changes with the two-step task. The authors find that the cognitive effort is higher for the second step than the first step in the two-step task. They use the free energy principle to show that the DDM and the AI are equivalent in the two-step task. They also compare the DDM with the AI by using the free energy principle.

**Methodology/Approach**
The authors' previous work shows that the DDM is a good choice to describe the human behavior in the two-step task. The authors use the DDM and the AI to study the decision making in the two-step task. They also compare the DDM with the AI by using the free energy principle. The authors find that the DDM and the AI are equivalent in the two-step task, but not for other problems.

**Results/Data**
The authors' previous work shows that the DDM is a good choice to describe the human behavior in the two-step task. The authors use the DDM and the AI to study the decision making in the two-step task. They also compare the DDM with the AI by using the free energy principle. The authors find that the DDM and the AI are equivalent in the two-step task, but not for other problems.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The main limitation of this paper is that the authors only study the decision making in the two-step task. They do not know whether the DDM and the AI are equivalent for other problems. The authors' previous work shows that the DDM and the AI are equivalent in the two-step task, but they do not know whether this is true for other problems. This paper does not discuss the limitations of the free energy principle.
