**Overview/Summary**

The paper discusses the calibration of centre-of-mass (ECM) energies at LEP 2, a high energy e+e- collider. The EECMs are determined by the luminosity and the effective cross section for the process e+e → μ+μ-. The authors present a detailed description of the methods used to determine the EECMs and their associated uncertainties. The paper is organized as follows: first, the authors discuss the principles of the calibration; secondly they describe the data used in the calibration; thirdly the results are presented for all running points at LEP 2; and finally the conclusions are summarised.

**Results/Data**

The luminosity- and cross-section-based EECMs were determined using a combination of the following: (i) measurements of the effective cross section, (ii) the luminosity, and (iii) the centre-of-mass energy.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The error assignment for the RFECM corrections arises from the following considerations: (i) any discrepancy between calculated and measured control variables, such as theQs or the horizontal beam displacements, indicates imperfections in the model. For instance, discrepancies in theQs reveal a lack of knowledge of the overall voltage scale or a phase error in the RF system; (ii) from measurements made with a beam-based alignment technique 16], the locations of the cavities are only known with a precision of 1 mm; and (iii) a small uncertainty comes from the unknown misalignments and non-uniformities of all the magnetic components of LEP. This contribution can be estimated by simulating an ensemble of machines with imperfections similar to those expected in LEP. The authors present a detailed description of the methods used to determine the EECMs. The paper is organized as follows: first, the authors discuss the principles of the calibration; secondly they describe the data used in the calibration; thirdly the results are presented for all running points at LEP 2; and finally the conclusions are summarised.
