**Overview/Summary**
The paper "On the Relationship Between Active Inference and Control as a Process Theory" by Parr, T., & Friston, K. (2019) is an important contribution to the field of reinforcement learning. The authors present a novel perspective on the connection between active inference and control that they term "generalised free energy". They argue that this framework can unify many different approaches in the literature under one common theoretical umbrella. In this paper, I will provide a summary of the key contributions, methodology, results, limitations, and discussion.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The main contribution of this paper is to show how active inference (Friston, 2010) and control as a process theory (Parr & Friston, 2017) can be unified under one theoretical framework. The authors argue that the free energy principle (Friston, 2008) has been used in many different ways in the literature to explain how the brain works. In particular, it has been used as a process theory for active inference, and also as a control theory for optimal learning. They present an example of how this can be done using a hierarchical generative model (Friston et al., 2017). The authors show that the process theory of active inference is closely related to the process theory of control. This has important implications for understanding the relationship between these two different approaches.

**Methodology/Approach**
The paper presents an example of how the free energy principle can be used as a unified framework for both active inference and control. The authors use a hierarchical generative model (Friston et al., 2017) to illustrate this point. They show that the process theory of active inference is closely related to the process theory of control. This has important implications for understanding the relationship between these two different approaches.

**Results/Data**
The paper presents an example of how the free energy principle can be used as a unified framework for both active inference and control. The authors use a hierarchical generative model (Friston et al., 2017) to illustrate this point. They show that the process theory of active inference is closely related to the process theory of control. This has important implications for understanding the relationship between these two different approaches.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The paper shows that the free energy principle can be used as a unified framework for both active inference and control, but it does not explain how this might be done in general. The authors do not discuss what the limitations of their approach are or how to extend it beyond the specific example they present.
