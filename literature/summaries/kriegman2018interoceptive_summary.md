**Overview/Summary**
The paper by Kriegman et al. [1] presents a new approach to increasing evolvability in soft robots through environment-mediated development. The authors argue that the traditional view of evolvability as an intrinsic property of the organism is too narrow, and instead propose that it can be increased through the use of environmental cues. In this paper, they demonstrate how the use of environmental information during the developmental process can increase the robustness of the final product to a wide range of environments. The authors' approach is based on the idea that the "environment" for an organism is not just its physical environment but also the internal state it is in (e.g., hunger, thirst). They propose a new type of development called "developmental canalization" which they define as "the process by which the developmental pathway becomes more robust to environmental variation." The authors' approach is based on the idea that the organism's internal state can be used as an environmental cue. This is achieved through the use of a minimal developmental model, where the developmental process is controlled by the environment and the final product is the result of this development. The authors demonstrate how this approach can increase evolvability in soft robots.

The authors' approach is based on the idea that the "environment" for an organism is not just its physical environment but also the internal state it is in (e.g., hunger, thirst). They argue that this process of development is canalization, and that this is a new type of canalization.

**Methodology/Approach**
The authors' approach to increasing evolvability in soft robots is based on the use of a minimal developmental model, where the developmental process is controlled by the environment and the final product is the result of this development. The authors propose that this type of development is a new type of canalization. This is achieved through the use of a minimal developmental model, where the developmental process is controlled by the environment and the final product is the result of this development. The authors demonstrate how this approach can increase evolvability in soft robots.

**Results/Data**
The authors' results are that their proposed new type of canalization increases evolvability in soft robots. This is demonstrated through a series of experiments where they compare the performance of two different types of developmental models, one with and one without the use of environmental cues during the development process. The authors demonstrate how this approach can increase evolvability by using a minimal developmental model. They also show that their proposed new type of canalization increases evolvability in soft robots.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The paper is well written, but it does not discuss any limitations or future work. It would be good to see some discussion on the potential drawbacks of this approach and how they can be addressed. The authors' results are interesting, but more experiments could be done to demonstrate the generality of their proposed new type of canalization.
