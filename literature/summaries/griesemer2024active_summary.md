Title: Active Sequential Posterior Estimation for Sample-Efficient Calibration of Origin-Destination Travel Demand

Abstract: The origin-destination (O-D) travel demand calibration problem is a fundamental challenge in the field of transportation planning, and it can be solved by using the sequential Bayesian inference (SBI) framework. In this paper, we propose an active sequential posterior estimation (ASNPE) method for sample-efficient calibration of O-D travel demand. The key idea of ASNPE is to drive down the disagreement between the marginal posterior p(θ|x) and the component posterior p(θ|xi), where xi is a simulated value. The main contribution of this paper is that we propose an acquisition function, which can be used to select the next simulation sample in the SBI framework. This acquisition function is based on the expected divergence between the marginal posterior and the component posterior. The expected divergence is defined as the difference between the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence of the marginal posterior and the KL divergence of the component posterior. The main advantage of this paper is that we can realize the sample-efficient calibration by using the proposed acquisition function in the SBI framework. The proposed method is evaluated on a real-world traffic simulation platform, SUMO. The results show that the ASNPE outperforms the SNPE-C in terms of the root mean squared normalized error (RMSNE), the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), the posterior median distance and the posterior mean error. These findings are consistent with the expected divergence term introduced in this paper when we let the measure D=KL.

The SBI framework is a powerful tool for solving the O-D travel demand calibration problem, but it requires a large number of simulation samples to achieve the high accuracy.
