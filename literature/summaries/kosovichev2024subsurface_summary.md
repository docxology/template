**Overview/Summary**

The paper discusses the subsurface dynamics of active region (AR) formation and flaring activity based on the time-distance helioseismology data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) instrument onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). The authors use the HMI data to infer the large-scale flows in the solar convection zone (SCZ) beneath the photosphere. They find that the subsurface flows are highly variable on a daily basis, but there is an overall pattern of formation and flaring activity of ARs. The most significant variations of the subsurface flows occur in the top 6 Mm deep layers, which is illustrated for five active regions (ARs) in Figures 2-4. In these layers, they observe the formation of vortices and shearing flows that contribute to the formation of the delta-type magnetic configurations, which are sources of powerful solar flares.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors find that the subsurface large-scale flows play a critical role in the AR formation and evolution. The most significant variations of the subsurface flows occur in the top 6 Mm deep layers. In these layers, they observe the formation of vortexes and shearing flows that contribute to the formation of the delta-type magnetic configurations, which are sources of powerful solar flares. The typical flow pattern during the initial emergence of bipolar magnetic regions consists of the flows diverging from the central area between the magnetic polarities observed in the line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms. A significant portion of the total magnetic flux can emerge in the central area between the forming sunspots, e.g., in the case of AR 13189, about half of the total flux emerged in such an area in the form of small-scale bipolar elements, which moved to the large-scale magnetic structures (sunspots) of the corresponding polarities, contributing to their formation. This process continued for about 3 days. It means that the emerging magnetic flux represents a large- scale, highly fragmented structure and that the accumulation of magnetic field in sunspots is a result of magnetic self-organization in the near-surface of the Sun.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use the HMI data to infer the large-scale flows in the solar convection zone (SCZ) beneath the photosphere. The presented examples of emerging ARs show that the subsurface large-scale flows play a critical role in the AR formation and evolution. Each flow map was obtained by analyzing an 8-hour series of solar oscillations observed in the SDO/HMI data. To track the active region (AR) evolution, the flow maps were obtained with a one-hour cadence and ten subsurface layers in the top 19 Mm of the solar convection zone. The most significant variations of the subsurface flows were observed in the top three layers in the depth range of 0–6 Mm, illustrated for five ARs in Figures 2-4. In these layers, they observe the formation of vortexes and shearing flows that contributed to the formation of the delta-type magnetic configurations, which were sources of powerful solar flares. The typical flow pattern during the initial emergence of bipolar magnetic regions consists of the flows diverging from the central area between the magnetic polarities observed in the LOS magnetograms. A significant portion of the total magnetic flux can emerge in the central area between the forming sunspots, e.g., in the case of AR 13189, about half of the total flux emerged in such an area in the form of small-scale bipolar elements, which moved to the large-scale magnetic structures (sunspots) of the corresponding polarities, contributing to their formation.
