**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Inferring Topology of Networked Dynamical Systems: A Causality and Correlation Perspective" by Y. Li and J. He is concerned with the problem of inferring the topology of a network from the dynamics of its nodes. The authors consider both the case where the input to the system is known (i.e., the "latent input") and the case where it is not, in which case they refer to the unknown input as the "unknown parameters." They present a unified approach that can be used for both cases based on the idea of inferring the topology from the dynamics of the nodes. The authors' approach is based on the following two key ideas: (1) the causal relationship between the state and the output of a node in the network, and (2) the correlation among the states of all the nodes in the network. In the first case where the input to the system is known, they show that the topology can be inferred from the dynamics of the nodes if the number of the unknown parameters is less than or equal to half the number of the nodes. This result is based on a new subspace identiﬁcation method with variance minimization and input design. In the second case where the input to the system is not known, they show that the topology can be inferred from the dynamics of the nodes if the unknown parameters are less than or equal to half the number of the nodes. This result is based on a new subspace identiﬁcation method with variance minimization and input design. The authors' approach is based on the following two key ideas: (1) the causal relationship between the state and the output of a node in the network, and (2) the correlation among the states of all the nodes in the network. In the first case where the input to the system is known, they show that the topology can be inferred from the dynamics of the nodes if the number of the unknown parameters is less than or equal to half the number of the nodes. This result is based on a new subspace identiﬁcation method with variance minimization and input design. In the second case where the input to the system is not known, they show that the topology can be inferred from the dynamics of the nodes if the unknown parameters are less than or equal to half the number of the nodes. This result is based on a new subspace identiﬁcation method with variance minimization and input design.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this paper are two-fold. The first one is that, for the case where the input to the system is known, they present a new subspace identiﬁcation method with variance minimization and input design. This method can be used to infer the topology from the dynamics of the nodes if the number of the unknown parameters is less than or equal to half the number of the nodes. The second one is that, for the case where the input to the system is not known, they show that the topology can be inferred from the dynamics of the nodes if the unknown parameters are less than or equal to half the number of the nodes. This result is based on a new subspace identiﬁcation method with variance minimization and input design.
