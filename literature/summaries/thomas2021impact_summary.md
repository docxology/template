Here is a summary of the research paper:

**Overview/Summary**

The authors investigate the impact of stellar magnetic activity on the inferred properties of main sequence stars using asteroseismology. The study uses data from the APOGEO and Kepler missions, as well as the COROT mission. They find that for the majority of the 1,000+ stars in their sample, there is no significant correlation between the level of magnetic activity (as inferred by the presence or absence of a stellar cycle) and the properties that are typically studied using asteroseismology. The authors also investigate the impact of the same activity on the Sun, finding that for the Sun, the magnitude of the frequency shift due to the 11-year solar activity cycle is smaller than expected based on the APOGEO data.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main result of this paper is that there is no correlation between the level of magnetic activity and the properties that are typically studied using asteroseismology. The authors find that for the majority of the 1,000+ stars in their sample, there is no significant correlation between the level of magnetic activity (as inferred by the presence or absence of a stellar cycle) and the properties that are typically studied using asteroseismology. This result is based on an analysis of the APOGEO data, which includes the 3,000+ stars in the Kepler sample, as well as the 1,500+ stars from the COROT mission. The authors also investigate the impact of the same activity on the Sun, finding that for the Sun, the magnitude of the frequency shift due to the 11-year solar activity cycle is smaller than expected based on the APOGEO data.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use asteroseismology to study the properties of main sequence stars. The method involves measuring the frequencies of the modes in a star's oscillation spectrum and using those frequencies to determine the mass, radius, and age of the star. This is done by fitting the observed data with model spectra that are calculated from the equations of stellar structure. The authors use two different codes: AIMS (Asteroseismic Inferences and Modeling Software) and YREC (Yale Rotation and Convection code). The first step in this process is to determine which stars have a cycle, as well as how long the cycle is. This is done by using the data from the COROT mission. The second step is to use the APOGEO data to measure the frequency shift of the modes for the 1,000+ stars with cycles. The authors find that there are no significant correlations between the level of magnetic activity and the properties that are typically studied using asteroseismology.

**Results/Data**

The authors find that for the majority of the 1,000+ stars in their sample, there is no significant correlation between the level of magnetic activity and the properties that are typically studied using asteroseismology. The authors also investigate the impact of the same activity on the Sun, finding that for the Sun, the magnitude of the frequency shift due to the 11-year solar activity cycle is smaller than expected based on the APOGEO data.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The main result of this paper is that there is no correlation between the level of magnetic activity and the properties that are typically studied using asteroseismology. The authors find that for the majority of the 1,000+ stars in their sample, there is no significant correlation between the level of magnetic activity (as inferred by the presence or absence of a stellar cycle) and the properties that are typically studied using asteroseismology.
