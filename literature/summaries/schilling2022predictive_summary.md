**Overview/Summary**

The paper discusses the role of two fundamental principles in the auditory system: predictive coding and stochastic resonance (SR). The authors argue that these two mechanisms are not only important for normal hearing but also play a crucial part in tinnitus, a common and debilitating condition characterized by the perception of sound when no external stimulus is present. Tinnitus can be caused by hearing loss, but it does not always occur after hearing loss; therefore, the authors suggest that there must be other factors involved in its development. The central gain and central noise models provide a sophisticated explanation for the tinnitus-related neural hyperactivity in the brainstem. However, these theories do not explain why this hyperactivity is transmitted through the thalamus and induces a conscious experience. Furthermore, the models do not make predictions on tinnitus heterogeneity.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors first discuss the central gain and central noise model based on SR mechanism for the tinnitus-related neural hyperactivity in the brainstem. The central gain and the central noise model provide a mechanistic explanation for the tinnitus- related neural hyperactivity in the brainstem. However, these theories do not explain why this hyperactivity is transmitted through the thalamus and induces a conscious experience. Furthermore, the models do not make predictions on tinnitus heterogeneity. The only model with a solid mathematical background dealing with this issue is the sensory precision model from Sedley et al., which is based on the algorithmic formulation of predictive coding within the computational "Bayesian brain" hypothesis.

**Results/Data**

The authors first discuss the central gain and the central noise model provide a sophisticated and mathematically well-developed explanation for the tinnitus- related neural hyperactivity in the brainstem.

**Additional Information**

The authors also discuss the purpose of the somatosensory projections to auditory nuclei such as the DCN. The central noise model based on SR mechanism provides a mechanistic explanation for the purpose of the somatosensory projections to auditory nuclei such as the DCN. The fact that tinnitus can be modulated by somatosensory input like, e.g., jaw movement [131–133] might accord with the finding that increased and uncorrelated noise, potentially the result from a noise source outside of the auditory pathway [33], might play a major role in tinnitus development. Potentially, this somatosensory input is nothing else than intrinsically generated neural noise, which is modulated in the DCN to leverage SR in the auditory system. This theory accords with the finding that tinnitus can be modulated by somatosensory input like, e.g., jaw movement [131–133]. Furthermore, tinnitus development can be prevented [134] or suppressed [135–137] by the presentation of external acoustic noise, which works best when the noise spectrum covers the impaired frequencies and the tinnitus pitch [135–137]. In a recent study, a novel approach has been developed combining somatosensory stimulation with auditory stimulation, in order to modulate the tinnitus loudness [138]. Finally, it has been demonstrated that electro- tactile stimulation of the finger tips enhances cochlear implant speech recognition in noise [139], Mandarin tone recognition [140], and melody recognition [141]. While the authors did not make any mention of stochastic resonance or internal noise, it is a reasonable assertion that the observed effect might have acted via cross-modal SR.
