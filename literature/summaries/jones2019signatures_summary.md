**Overview/Summary**
The authors of this research paper propose a new mechanism for the conversion of gravitational wave energy to electromagnetic and sound radiation in the context of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). The idea is that the gravitational waves produced during the collapse of massive stars can be converted into phonons, which are then locally reheated by the material. This process could lead to the re-ignition of fusion reactions in the unshocked ejecta and the subsequent heating of the surrounding medium. The authors argue that this process may have a significant impact on the evolution of the supernova remnant (SNR) and its associated SN, and they suggest that the coproduction of electromagnetic and sound radiation could be an important piece of physics that is generally suppressed in current models of CCSNe and their remnants.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The authors provide a rough estimate for the contribution to the evolution of the supernova remnant from the co-produced electromagnetic and sound radiation. They also demonstrate that the coproduction of these two types of radiation could introduce new components to the X-ray spectrum, which could only be predicted by including the mechanism in computational models. The idea bears a resemblance to mechanisms proposed for heating the solar corona.

**Methodology/Approach**
The authors do not provide a detailed description of their methodology or approach. This is because the paper does not contain any experimental data and it is based on theoretical arguments. The authors' rough estimate for the contribution to the evolution of the supernova remnant from the co-produced electromagnetic and sound radiation is based on a simple calculation, which is described in the paper.
