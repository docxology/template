**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Optimal Neural Summarisation for Full-Field Weak Lensing Cosmological Implicit Inference" by Denise Lanzieri et al. (2022) presents a new approach to the problem of performing Bayesian inference with weak lensing data, which is a statistical analysis of the distortions in the shapes and positions of galaxies that are caused by the gravitational field of large-scale structures. The authors use a 3D galaxy survey to measure the distribution of the distortions (or "shear") on the sky, and they find that the shear is not isotropic. They then perform an analysis using this data, along with a simulated version of the same data set, in order to compare their results with those from a different cosmological model. The authors use a 3D galaxy survey, which was used to measure the distribution of the distortions (or "shear") on the sky, and they find that the shear is not isotropic. They then perform an analysis using this data, along with a simulated version of the same data set, in order to compare their results with those from a different cosmological model.
