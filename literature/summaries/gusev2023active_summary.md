**Overview/Summary**
The paper "Active Learning Guided Drug Design Lead Optimization Based on Papain-Like Protease from SARS-CoV-2 and Its Complexes with Non-Covalent Inhibitors" presents a novel approach to the design of inhibitors for the papain-like protease (PLpro) from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The authors first review the current state-of-the-art in the field, including the crystal structures of PLpro and its complexes with non-covalent inhibitors. Then, they describe their approach to the design of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro inhibitors based on binding cooperativity. They use a combination of active learning (AL) and molecular docking to lead optimize the design of inhibitors. The AL is used for the selection of the most informative compounds from a large number of candidates, while the molecular docking is used for the prediction and optimization of the binding affinity of these selected compounds.
