**Overview/Summary**

The authors of this study aimed to characterize active learning environments in physics classes using a novel approach based on latent profile analysis (LPA). They analyzed 1,441 videos from 15 introductory physics classes and found that the majority of these classes were not actively engaging. The LPA method is an unsupervised statistical technique that groups data into distinct "latent profiles" based on patterns of activity. In this case, the authors used a dataset of 1,441 video recordings from 15 introductory physics classes to identify the most common active learning environments in which students are engaged with the course material. The videos were recorded by cameras installed in the classrooms and captured all the activities that occurred during class time. The instructors taught the same curriculum using different pedagogies. The authors used a coding scheme based on the work of Hakeem et al. [1] to identify the types of student and instructor activity, which they then combined into 12 categories: listening (L), individual thinking (Ind), group discussion (CG), working in groups (WG), other assigned group activities (OG), answering student questions (AnQ), asking a clicker question (CQ), answering a non-clicker question (PQ), making a prediction about the outcome of an experiment or demonstration (Prd), presenting to the class (SP), taking a test or quiz (TQ), waiting for the instructor (W), and other activities (O). The instructors were doing lecturing (Lec), following up on a clicker question (FUp), asking a non-clicker question (AnQ), demonstrating an experiment, simulation, video, or animation (D/V), and administration (Adm). The authors used the LPA method to identify the most common patterns of activity that occurred in these classes. They found that 59% of the classes were not actively engaging. The majority of the classes that were not active engaged had a high proportion of students waiting for the instructor, which was likely due to the fact that the instructors spent more time lecturing than doing other activities.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors used LPA to identify 8 latent profiles in the data set. These profiles are characterized by the proportion of time spent on different types of student and instructor activity. The most common profile, which accounted for 59% of the classes, had a high proportion of students waiting for the instructor (W) and a low proportion of other activities that engaged the class. The second most common profile was also not active in the sense that it had a high proportion of W. This profile differed from the first one because the proportion of time spent on AnQ and CQ was higher than the first profile. The third most common profile, which accounted for 14% of the classes, had a low proportion of W and a high proportion of other activities (O). The remaining 5 profiles were not as well represented in the data set. The authors found that the majority of the classes that were not active engaged had a high proportion of students waiting for the instructor. This was likely due to the fact that the instructors spent more time lecturing than doing other activities.

**Results/Data**

The authors used LPA to identify 8 latent profiles in the data set. These profiles are characterized by the proportion of time spent on different types of student and instructor activity. The most common profile, which accounted for 59% of the classes, had a high proportion of students waiting for the instructor (W) and a low proportion of other activities that engaged the class. The second most common profile was also not active in the sense that it had a high proportion of W. This profile differed from the first one because the proportion of time spent on AnQ and CQ was higher than the first profile. The third most common profile, which accounted for 14% of the classes, had a low proportion of W and a high proportion of other activities (O). The remaining 5 profiles were not as well represented in the data set. The authors found that the majority of the classes that were not active engaged had a high proportion of students waiting for the instructor. This was likely due to the fact that the instructors spent more time lecturing than doing other activities.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The study's findings are limited by the fact that it only analyzed 15 introductory physics classes and the videos from these classes were recorded in one semester. The authors used a coding scheme based on the work of Hakeem et al. [1] to identify the types of student and instructor activity, which they then combined into 12 categories: listening (L), individual thinking (Ind), group discussion (CG), working in groups (WG), other assigned group activities (OG), answering student questions (AnQ), asking a clicker question (CQ), answering a non-clicker question (PQ), making a prediction about the outcome of an experiment or demonstration (Prd), presenting to the class (SP), taking a test or quiz (TQ), waiting for the instructor (W), and other activities (O).
