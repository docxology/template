**Overview/Summary**
The paper "Gravity at Finite Temperature, Equivalence Principle, and Lorentz Noninvariance" by M. Gasperini is a theoretical study on the nature of gravity in the context of the equivalence principle (EP) and the possibility of a fifth force. The authors investigate the effects of finite temperature on the EP and the existence of a fifth force in the framework of a quasi-Riemannian theory of gravitation, which is an extension of general relativity that includes a nonvanishing cosmological constant. They also discuss some implications for the local SO(3,1) invariance of the gravitational interaction at the solar system level and the composition dependence of the fifth force.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The authors study the effects of finite temperature on the EP by using the thermodynamic approach to the theory of gravitation. The first part of the paper is a review of the main results that have been obtained in this context. They also discuss some implications for the local SO(3,1) invariance of the gravitational interaction at the solar system level and the composition dependence of the fifth force.

**Methodology/Approach**
The authors start by reviewing the main results on the effects of finite temperature on the EP that have been obtained in the context of a quasi-Riemannian theory of gravitation. The second part is a discussion of the implications for the local SO(3,1) invariance of the gravitational interaction at the solar system level and the composition dependence of the fifth force.

**Results/Data**
The authors discuss some implications for the local SO(3,1) invariance of the gravitational interaction at the solar system level and the composition dependence of the fifth force. The main results are a set of constraints on the parameters that characterize the theory. They also provide a discussion of the possible effects of the nonvanishing cosmological constant on the EP.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The authors note that the possibility of a fifth force is not supported by the data from the Cassini mission, which has measured the perihelion shift of Mercury with an accuracy of 0.01 arcsec. The authors also mention some implications for the nonvanishing cosmological constant on the EP.
