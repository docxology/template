**Overview/Summary**

The paper by Sparavigna and Strigazzi (2019) is a theoretical study on the structure of the distortion free-energy density in nematic liquid crystals. The authors show that the second-order elastic energy density can be written as a linear combination of 3 independent scalars, which are called Lifshitz vectors. The first two Lifshitz vectors are the usual ones for the splay and twist distortions, while the third one is related to the helicity distortion, which is the subject of this paper. This new type of distortion has been previously discussed in the literature by Dzyaloshinskii (1964) [8], Moriya (1960) [9] and Bogdanov et al. (2002) [10]. The authors show that the helicity free-energy density is a linear combination of 3 independent scalars, which are called Lifshitz vectors.
