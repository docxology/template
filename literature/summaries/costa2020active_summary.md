**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Active inference on discrete state-spaces: a synthesis" by Friston et al. (2017) is an interdisciplinary work that bridges the gap between neuroscience and machine learning. The authors provide a unifying framework for understanding how the brain makes decisions, including both perception and action selection. They present a general mathematical model of active inference, which is a process in which the brain uses its current state to make predictions about future states, and then acts on those predictions to minimize the difference between the predicted and actual outcomes. The paper synthesizes the main ideas from two different strands of research: (1) the neuroscience literature on the neural mechanisms that underlie active inference, and (2) the machine learning literature on Bayesian decision theory.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors provide a mathematical model for understanding how the brain makes decisions. This is based on the idea that the brain uses its current state to make predictions about future states, and then acts on those predictions to minimize the difference between the predicted and actual outcomes. The paper synthesizes the main ideas from two different strands of research: (1) the neuroscience literature on the neural mechanisms that underlie active inference, and (2) the machine learning literature on Bayesian decision theory.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors start by presenting a mathematical model for understanding how the brain makes decisions. This is based on the idea that the brain uses its current state to make predictions about future states, and then acts on those predictions to minimize the difference between the predicted and actual outcomes. The paper synthesizes the main ideas from two different strands of research: (1) the neuroscience literature on the neural mechanisms that underlie active inference, and (2) the machine learning literature on Bayesian decision theory.

**Results/Data**

The authors provide a mathematical model for understanding how the brain makes decisions. This is based on the idea that the brain uses its current state to make predictions about future states, and then acts on those predictions to minimize the difference between the predicted and actual outcomes. The paper synthesizes the main ideas from two different strands of research: (1) the neuroscience literature on the neural mechanisms that underlie active inference, and (2) the machine learning literature on Bayesian decision theory.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors do not discuss any limitations or weaknesses in this paper. However, it is possible to imagine some potential issues with pruning policy trees. The paper does not provide a complete treatment of how biological organisms perform deep policy searches. Further research is needed to characterise the processes in which biological agents reduce large policy spaces to tractable subspaces.
