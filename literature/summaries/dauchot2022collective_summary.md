**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Collective Motion in Active Materials: Model Experiments" by [Authors] investigates the collective motion of active materials, which are a class of soft matter that can convert chemical energy into mechanical work through self-organization. The authors propose an experimentally testable theoretical model for the steady-state and dynamic behavior of the system. They find that the global interaction potential is non-additive and has both long-range and short-range components. The long-range part, which is a dipolar term, arises from the hydrodynamic interactions between the particles. The short-range part, which is an alignment term, comes from the electrostatic repulsion and the hydrodynamic interactions at short distances. The authors also find that the global interaction potential has both finite- and infinite-distance screening. The authors test their model by comparing the predictions of the model with experimental data in a channel geometry. They show that the steady-state behavior is determined by the long-range part, while the dynamic behavior is determined by the short-range part.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main results of this paper are the following: (1) The authors find that the global interaction potential has both finite- and infinite-distance screening. In the absence of the B and C terms, the model reduces to the so-called "flying XY model" introduced phenomenologically in [36]. Nevertheless, additional terms have been obtained from the microscopic analysis. (2) The coeﬃcient B( r ) is positive, since 1+ 1/2 > 0 and -1 < 0 in our experimental system. It corresponds to the electrostatic repulsive coupling. The last term C( r ) combines electric and hydrodynamic interactions. Contrary to A( r ),t h e s e a d d i t i o n a lt e r m si n E q . (3) The coeﬃicients A( r ) and B( r ) are finite- range interactions, being screened on a distance set by the channel height. (4) The authors test their model by comparing the predictions of the model with experimental data in a channel geometry. They show that the steady-state behavior is determined by the long-range part, while the dynamic behavior is determined by the short-range part.

**Methodology/Approach**

The microscopic analysis is based on the following assumptions: (i) The particles are point-like and do not overlap. (ii) The particles can move freely in the two-dimensional plane. (iii) The channel height is much larger than the particle size, so that the screening of the long-range hydrodynamic interactions is negligible. (iv) The noise term in Eq. 17 is a Gaussian white noise with zero mean and unit varianceh⇠i( t )= ( t  t0). (v) The authors use the following physical parameters: the channel height H, the particle size a, the screening lengthH/⇡, the electrostatic coupling strengthµ?, and the hydrodynamic viscosity coefficient ˜µs. The authors also introduce a noise term in Eq. 17 to account for rotational diﬀusion. ⇠i( t ) is a Gaussian white noise with zero mean and unit varianceh⇠i( t )= ( t  t0). (vi) The only phenomenological coeﬃcient of the theory is the rotational diﬀusivity Dr. The authors show that the long-range part of the global interaction potential arises from the hydrodynamic interactions between the particles, and the short-range part comes from the electrostatic repulsion and the hydrodynamic interactions at short distances. (vii) A( r ) and B( r ) are finite- range interactions, being screened on a distance set by the channel height. The authors also find that the long-range part of the global interaction potential is non-additive and has both finite- and infinite-distance screening.

**Results/Data**

The authors test their model by comparing the predictions of the model with experimental data in a channel geometry. They show that the steady-state behavior is determined by the long-range part, while the dynamic behavior is determined by the short-range part. The authors also find that the global interaction potential has both finite- and infinite-distance screening. In the absence of the B and C terms, the model reduces to the so-called "flying XY model" introduced phenomenologically in [36]. Nevertheless, additional terms have been obtained from the microscopic analysis. (i) The term A( r ) ˆpj · ˆpi is an alignment interaction. It arises both from the short- distance hydrodynamic interactions and from part of the electrostatic couplings. They correspond respectively to the first and the second terms in (S19). (ii) In the absence of the B and C terms, our model would reduce to the so-called "flying XY model" introduced phenomenologically in [36]. Nevertheless, additional terms have been obtained from the microscopic analysis. (iii) The coeﬃcient B( r ) is positive, since 1+ 1/2 > 0 and -1 < 0 in our experimental system. It corresponds to the electrostatic repulsive coupling. The last term C( r ) combines electric and hydrodynamic interactions. Contrary to A( r ),t h e s e a d d i t i o n a lt e r m si n E q . (iv) A( r ) and B( r ) are finite- range interactions, being screened on a distance set by the channel height. The authors also find that the long-range part of the global interaction potential is non-additive and has both finite- and infinite-distance screening.
