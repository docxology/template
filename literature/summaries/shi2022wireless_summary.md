**Overview/Summary**

The paper discusses the potential of a wireless energy transfer (WET) in a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided cell-free massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) system with the aim to realize the Internet of Everything (IoE). The authors first present several application scenarios for such a system and propose different operation modes. They then discuss the suitable RIS hardware design for WET. Finally, they investigate possible deployment methods for the RISs in the system. The paper also indicates the critical challenges and promising research directions to realize the RIS-aided cell-free massive MIMO systems with WET.
