**Overview/Summary**
The paper "Exploring and Learning Structure: Active Inference Approach" by de Tinguy et al. (2023) presents an active inference approach to autonomous navigation using the minigrid environment. The authors' main goal is to investigate how a cognitive map can be learned from experience, which is a fundamental question in the field of spatial cognition. They use the minigrid environment as a simplified model for real-world environments and study the learning process with an active inference approach. In this paper, they focus on the following three aspects: the structure of the environment, the exploration strategy, and the learning mechanism.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The authors' main contributions are to propose an active inference framework that can be used for autonomous navigation in a minigrid environment. The key findings of this paper are as follows.
Firstly, they show that the cognitive map is a latent sequence that can be learned from experience and its learning process is based on the structured sequence learning approach. This means that the authors' proposed model does not require any prior knowledge about the structure of the environment. They also propose a minigrid environment with the following features: it has a grid cell, which represents an agent's location; there are four types of objects in the minigrid environment (wall, goal, door and wall-door), and they can be distinguished by their color; the agent can move to any unvisited cell. The authors' proposed model is based on the active inference approach that has been widely used for modeling human brain function. In this paper, the authors use the free energy principle as a learning mechanism. This means that the learning process of the cognitive map is not supervised and it is driven by the agent's curiosity or the desire to minimize the uncertainty in the environment. The authors' proposed model can be applied to any minigrid environment with different structures and sizes, which makes it possible for the model to learn from experience.

**Methodology/Approach**
The authors use a minigrid environment as a simplified model for real-world environments. In this paper, they focus on the following three aspects: the structure of the environment, the exploration strategy, and the learning mechanism. The structure of the environment is represented by the cognitive map that can be learned from experience. The exploration strategy is based on the active inference approach. This means that the agent's motion in the minigrid environment is not determined by a predefined policy but it is driven by the desire to minimize the uncertainty in the environment. The learning mechanism of the authors' proposed model is the free energy principle, which is an unsupervised learning process. In this paper, the authors use the minigrid as a simplified model for real-world environments and study the learning process with the active inference approach.

**Results/Data**
The cognitive map can be learned from experience. The learning process of the cognitive map is based on the structured sequence learning approach. This means that the authors' proposed model does not require any prior knowledge about the structure of the environment. They also propose a minigrid environment with the following features: it has a grid cell, which represents an agent's location; there are four types of objects in the minigrid environment (wall, goal, door and wall-door), and they can be distinguished by their color; the agent can move to any unvisited cell. The authors' proposed model is based on the active inference approach that has been widely used for modeling human brain function. In this paper, the authors use the free energy principle as a learning mechanism. This means that the learning process of the cognitive map is not supervised and it is driven by the agent's curiosity or the desire to minimize the uncertainty in the environment. The authors' proposed model can be applied to any minigrid environment with different structures and sizes, which makes it possible for the model to learn from experience.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The main weakness of this paper is that the authors do not provide a detailed comparison between their proposed model and other models. This means that the authors' proposed model does not have a clear advantage over other models in terms of learning efficiency, which is an important aspect for autonomous navigation. The authors also do not discuss the application of the active inference approach to real-world environments. The authors' proposed model can be applied to any minigrid environment with different structures and sizes, which makes it possible for the model to learn from experience.
