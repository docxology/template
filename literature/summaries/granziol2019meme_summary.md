**Overview/Summary**

The paper by Granziol et al. (2019) presents a new method for approximating the maximum entropy (MEMe) of a log-determinant and its application to Bayesian optimization. The authors introduce the MEMe algorithm as an alternative to the well-known Hennig's Entropy Search (ES), which is a popular algorithm in the field of Bayesian optimization. The main motivation behind this work is that ES has some limitations, such as it is not applicable for all types of cost functions and the computational complexity is high when the number of parameters is large. In particular, the authors show that there are many cases where the MEMe algorithm can be more accurate than the ES algorithm.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this paper are the introduction of the MEMe algorithm and its application to Bayesian optimization. The authors first introduce a new method for approximating the maximum entropy (MEMe) of a log-determinant, which is based on the idea that the maximum entropy can be obtained by maximizing the logarithmic moment. This idea is used in the ES algorithm, but it is not applicable for all types of cost functions and the computational complexity is high when the number of parameters is large. The authors show that there are many cases where the MEMe algorithm can be more accurate than the ES algorithm. For example, the authors compare the performance of the two algorithms on a synthetic function optimization problem with 1000 parameters, and they find that the MEMe algorithm performs better in this case. This is because the computational complexity of the MEMe algorithm is much lower than the ES algorithm when the number of parameters is large.

**Results/Data**

The authors compare the performance of the two algorithms on a synthetic function optimization problem with 1000 parameters, and they find that the MEMe algorithm performs better in this case. This is because the computational complexity of the MEMe algorithm is much lower than the ES algorithm when the number of parameters is large.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors acknowledge some limitations of their work. For example, the authors do not provide a theoretical guarantee for the performance of the MEMe algorithm in the paper. The authors also mention that there are many cases where the MEMe algorithm can be more accurate than the ES algorithm, but they do not provide an explicit condition to determine when the MEMe algorithm is better than the ES algorithm.
