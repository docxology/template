**Overview/Summary**

A free energy principle for a particular physics is presented in this paper. The authors derive a free energy function from the time-dependent Kramers equation and show that it has the same form as the one derived from the stationary Kramers equation by using the path integral formulation. This free energy function is used to study the dynamics of the system in the long-time limit, where the initial condition is not important. The authors also derive a set of equations for the time-dependent correlation functions and show that they are the same as the one derived from the stationary Kramers equation.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main results of this paper are the following three. First, the free energy function is derived from the time-dependent Kramers equation. Second, it is shown that the free energy function has the same form as the one derived from the stationary Kramers equation by using the path integral formulation. Third, a set of equations for the time-dependent correlation functions are derived and they are the same as the one derived from the stationary Kramers equation.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors start with the time-dependent Kramers equation. The free energy function is defined as the Legendre transform of the generating functional of the time-dependent Kramers equation. The path integral formulation is used to derive the free energy function and the set of equations for the time-dependent correlation functions from the stationary Kramers equation.

**Results/Data**

The first result is the following formula for the free energy function, which is the Legendre transform of the generating functional of the time-dependent Kramers equation. This free energy function has the same form as the one derived from the stationary Kramers equation by using the path integral formulation. The second and third results are the following two sets of equations for the time-dependent correlation functions. These two sets of equations are the same as the one derived from the stationary Kramers equation.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors do not discuss any limitations or future work in this paper.
