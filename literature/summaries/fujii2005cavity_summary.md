**Overview/Summary**

The paper presents a theoretical study on cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) and its application to quantum computation in the weak coupling regime. The authors aim to provide an analytical solution for the Tavis-Cummings model, which is a fundamental model of a two-atom system interacting with a quantized electromagnetic field, by using the Rabi frequency expansion method. This paper is organized as follows: First, the authors explain the cavity QED and quantum computation in the weak coupling regime, then they give an overview of the Tavis-Cummings model and its analytical solutions for one, two, three and four atoms. Next, the authors derive the explicit form of the evolution operator of the Tavis-Cummings model. The last section is devoted to a summary.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contribution of this paper is that it provides an analytical solution for the Tavis-Cummings model in the weak coupling regime by using the Rabi frequency expansion method. This is the first time that the explicit form of the evolution operator is obtained. The authors also give the analytical solutions for one, two, three and four atoms cases. These results are useful to understand the quantum properties of the system in the weak coupling regime.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use the Rabi frequency expansion method to derive the explicit form of the evolution operator of the Tavis-Cummings model. The Rabi frequency is defined as $\Omega_{0} = \frac{\gamma}{2}$, where $\gamma$ is the decay rate of an excited atom. The first order approximation in this expansion is the standard rotating wave approximation (RWA) and the second order one is the non-Rotating Wave Approximation (NRA). The authors use the NNA to obtain the analytical solutions for the Tavis-Cummings model. The Rabi frequency expansion method is a powerful tool to solve the quantum systems, which has been widely used in the field of quantum optics.

**Results/Data**

The results are the explicit form of the evolution operator and the analytical solutions for one, two, three and four atoms cases. These results are useful to understand the quantum properties of the system in the weak coupling regime.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors' work is a theoretical study and there are no experimental data or numerical data in this paper. The authors do not discuss the limitations of their approach. There are some future works, such as the application of the Rabi frequency expansion method to other quantum systems and the extension of the Tavis-Cummings model to a large number of atoms.

**Summary**
