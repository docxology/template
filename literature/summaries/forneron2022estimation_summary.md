**Estimation and Inference by Stochastic Optimization**

**Overview/Summary**
The authors of this paper propose a new approach to estimation and inference in statistical models that are based on the stochastic optimization (SO) framework. The SO approach is an iterative procedure where at each step, the model parameters are updated according to some rule until convergence. This is different from traditional maximum likelihood estimation or Bayesian inference approaches which are typically based on a single pass through the data. The authors show that the SO approach can be used for both point and interval estimation. They also propose two new methods: stochastic gradient ascent (SGA) and stochastic quasi-Newton (SQN). The SGA is an iterative algorithm where at each step, the model parameters are updated according to a stochastic version of the gradient of the objective function. The SQN is a stochastic version of the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) quasi-Newton method for optimization. The authors show that the SGA and SQN can be used for both point and interval estimation. They also provide some implementation-specific results to show that the SO approach applies to the stochastic gradient ascent (SGA), stochastic quasi-Newton (SQN), and stochastic Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithms. The SGA is an iterative algorithm where at each step, the model parameters are updated according to a stochastic version of the gradient of the objective function. The SQN is a stochastic version of the BFGS quasi-Newton method for optimization. The authors show that the SGA and SQN can be used for both point and interval estimation. They also provide some implementation-specific results to show that the SO approach applies to the SGA, SQN, and BFGS algorithms.
