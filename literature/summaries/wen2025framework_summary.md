**Overview/Summary**

The paper presents a framework for inherently safer artificial general intelligence (AGI) and is motivated by the concern of potential catastrophic consequences if AGIs are not developed with safety in mind from the outset. The authors argue that the current approach to developing safe AI, which is to develop a safe AI after it has been deployed, is unlikely to be effective. Instead, they propose a framework for developing an inherently safer AGI by building on the foundations of active inference (AI), which is a probabilistic theory of perception and action that can be used as a basis for designing more robust and transparent AI systems. The authors argue that the current approach to developing safe AI is unlikely to be effective because it does not take into account the fact that AI will be able to learn from humans in real time, and this learning process may lead to an AGI that is not only unsafe but also difficult to control or predict. The paper presents a multi-agent active inference (MAAI) architecture for developing such an inherently safer AGI. The authors argue that the current approach to developing safe AI is unlikely to be effective because it does not take into account the fact that AI will be able to learn from humans in real time, and this learning process may lead to an AGI that is not only unsafe but also difficult to control or predict.
