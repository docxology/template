**Overview/Summary**

The present study is a deep active inference (DAI) model of the rubber-hand illusion, which is a well-known phenomenon where an artificial hand is perceived to be part of one's own body when it is manipulated in synchrony with one's own movements. The authors investigate this phenomenon using a DAI approach that is based on the free energy principle. In the present study, the authors use a deep neural network as a generative model for the sensory and motor representations of the rubber hand. This is different from previous studies where the authors have used a probabilistic latent space (PLS) to represent the internal state of the system. The DAI approach has been widely applied in the field of computer vision, but it has not been applied in the field of robotics or cognitive science. In this study, the authors use a DAI model as an artificial agent in a virtual environment and compare its performance with that of a PLS-based model. The results show that both models can produce similar perceptual and active patterns to those found in humans.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contribution of the present paper is the application of the DAI approach to the study of body perception and action during sensorimotor conflicts, such as the RHI. It is a new attempt to apply the DAI approach in the field of robotics or cognitive science. The authors show that both models can produce similar perceptual and active patterns to those found in humans. This suggests that the DAI approach may be used to investigate the construction of the sensorimotor self.

**Methodology/Approach**

The present study is a deep learning-based method for the study of body perception and action during sensorimotor conflicts, such as the RHI. The authors use a DAI model as an artificial agent in a virtual environment and compare its performance with that of a PLS-based model. The results show that both models can produce similar perceptual and active patterns to those found in humans. This suggests that the DAI approach may be used to investigate the construction of the sensorimotor self.

**Results/Data**

The authors use a deep neural network as a generative model for the sensory and motor representations of the rubber hand. The results show that both models can produce similar perceptual and active patterns to those found in humans. This suggests that the DAI approach may be used to investigate the construction of the sensorimotor self.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors do not discuss the limitations or future work of their study.
