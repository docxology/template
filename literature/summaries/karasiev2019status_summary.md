**Overview/Summary**

The paper by Karasiev et al. [1] discusses the status of free-energy representations for the homogeneous electron gas in a periodic potential. The authors present an extensive analysis of the current state of affairs in this field, with a focus on the various approaches that have been used to calculate the free energy of the system. The paper is organized as follows: First, the authors discuss the general problem and the different types of free-energy representations that are possible for the homogeneous electron gas. Next, they review the current status of the two most popular methods, the density-functional theory (DFT) [2] and the path-integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) method [3]. The DFT is a variational approach that uses an approximate functional to calculate the free energy. The PIMC is a stochastic method based on the Feynman-Kacato-Salsberg (FKS) formula for the free energy, which can be used to study both the ground state and the excited states of the system. In this paper, the authors focus on the DFT and the PIMC. The main results are presented in Section 2.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main finding is that the two most popular methods for calculating the free energy of the homogeneous electron gas have their own strengths and weaknesses. The DFT has been extensively used to calculate the ground state, but it does not work well when the system is excited. In contrast, the PIMC can be used to study both the ground state and the excited states. The authors also present a new method for calculating the free energy that uses the FKS formula in a different way than the traditional PIMC. This new approach has its own strengths and weaknesses.

**Methodology/Approach**

The DFT is based on the variational principle, which states that the minimum of the total free energy with respect to the number of particles is equal to the ground state free energy [4]. The authors discuss the general problem and the different types of free-energy representations. They also review the current status of the two most popular methods, the DFT and the PIMC. The main results are presented in Section 2.

**Results/Data**

The first finding is that the two most popular methods for calculating the free energy of the homogeneous electron gas have their own strengths and weaknesses. The DFT has been extensively used to calculate the ground state, but it does not work well when the system is excited. In contrast, the PIMC can be used to study both the ground state and the excited states. The authors also present a new method for calculating the free energy that uses the FKS formula in a different way than the traditional PIMC. This new approach has its own strengths and weaknesses.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The main weakness of the DFT is that it does not work well when the system is excited. The authors also discuss the limitations of the PIMC, which is that it can be used to study both the ground state and the excited states but the accuracy of the results depends on the number of Monte Carlo steps.
