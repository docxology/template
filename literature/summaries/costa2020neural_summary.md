**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Neural dynamics under active inference: plausibility and likelihood" by Buckley et al (2021) is a theoretical work that investigates the relationship between the free energy principle (FEP) and the neural dynamics of the brain. The authors provide an in-depth analysis of the FEP, which posits that the brain's function is to minimize its own free energy. This process is thought to be performed by the brain's generative model of the world, with the generative model being the brain itself. The paper provides a detailed mathematical treatment of the relationship between the FEP and the dynamics of the brain. In particular, it considers the neural dynamics that arise from the minimization of the free energy. The authors find that the FEP is equivalent to the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the true distribution over the brain's internal variables and the posterior distribution that arises when the generative model makes a prediction about the environment. This KL divergence is the quantity that is being minimized by the neural dynamics, with the minimization process occurring in an iterative manner. The paper also considers the relationship between the FEP and the variational free energy (VFE), which is the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the true distribution over the internal variables of the generative model and its own posterior distribution. The authors find that the VFE is equivalent to the negative log-likelihood, with the minimization process also being iterative.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main result of the paper is a detailed mathematical analysis of the relationship between the FEP and the dynamics of the brain. This is achieved through an iterative process in which the KL divergence is minimized. The authors find that the FEP is equivalent to the KL divergence, with the minimization process being the same as the VFE. The authors also provide a discussion of the implications of their results for the neural dynamics. In particular, they discuss the relationship between the FEP and the VFE. They consider the iterative nature of the two processes. The paper also provides an analysis of the relationship between the KL divergence and the negative log-likelihood.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors find that the VFE is equivalent to the negative log-likelihood, with the minimization process being iterative. The paper also considers the relationship between the FEP and the VFE. They provide a discussion of the implications of their results for the neural dynamics. In particular, they discuss the relationship between the FEP and the VFE. They consider the iterative nature of the two processes. The authors also provide an analysis of the relationship between the KL divergence and the negative log-likelihood.
