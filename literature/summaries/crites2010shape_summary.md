**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Shape and pattern containment of separable permutations" by Michael Albert, Jeﬀ Buzas, and Jonathan F. Buss presents a new approach to the problem of finding the shortest common supersequence (SCS) for all k-element permutations. The main result is that there are at least n(1 + 2γ) permutations whose SCS has length O(n log n), where γ is Euler's constant. This is in contrast to the trivial upper bound of n! on the length of an SCS, and it also shows that the number of corners of |µ(n)| is given by ⌊√4n + 1⌋ − 1. The paper also presents a new algorithm for finding the SCS, which is simpler than the previously known algorithms.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main result in this paper is that there are at least n(1 + 2γ) permutations whose shortest common supersequence (SCS) has length O(n log n), where γ is Euler's constant. The trivial upper bound on the length of an SCS is n!, so this shows that the number of corners of |µ(n)| is given by ⌊√4n + 1⌋ − 1. The paper also presents a new algorithm for finding the SCS, which is simpler than the previously known algorithms.

**Methodology/Approach**

The main tool used in this paper is the theory of Young tableaux. This is a well-studied area of combinatorics that has been applied to many dient problems. The authors use the following deﬁnition of a separable permutation: A permutation π is called separable if it can be written as π = (π1, . . , πk) where each πi is a 1-element subset of [n] and the sets {π1, . . , πk} are disjoint. The authors also use the following deﬁnition of an SCS: An SCS for all k-element permutations is a string that contains every k-element permutation as a subsequence. This can be thought of as a string containing all 2-element permutations as subsequences, or equivalently, it is a sequence of n elements where each element is one of the two symbols {0, 1} and the number of times the symbol 1 appears in the string is even.

**Results/Data**

The main result in this paper is that there are at least n(1 + 2γ) permutations whose SCS has length O(n log n), where γ is Euler's constant. The trivial upper bound on the length of an SCS is n!, so this shows that the number of corners of |µ(n)| is given by ⌊√4n + 1⌋ − 1.
