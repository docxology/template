=== OVERVIEW ===
A study on audio synchronous steganography detection and decryption is presented in this paper. The main contributions of the paper are the design of a novel audio steganography detection method based on the time-frequency analysis, the extraction of the potential synchronization marker frames from the suspicious segments, and the design of a bit-level decoding algorithm for the extracted data.

=== KEY CONTRIBUTIONS/KEY FINDINGS ===
The proposed steganalysis method is based on the time-frequency analysis. The main idea of this approach is to analyze the time-frequency characteristics of the audio signal in the suspected segment. If the energy distribution of the suspicious segment is significantly different from that of the normal speech, it can be considered as a potential embedded region of synchronization marker frames. In order to further verify the steganography behavior in the audio signal, the paper also designs an ultra-fine sampling with custom bit-level decoding algorithms to try to extract the potential embedded data structures.

=== METHOD/Approach ===
The analysis in this section focuses on the audio data segments from 36 seconds to 60 seconds. The specific extraction process is as follows: Synchronization frame detection and segment extraction: As a sequence of consecutive FF (full 1-byte) markers is detected in the 36-38 second interval, which is presumed to be the embedded region of synchronization marker frames.

=== RESULTS/DATA ===
After the high-frequency suspicious segments have been identified, the study enters the fine-grained steganographic data extraction and decryption process. The analysis in this section focuses on audio data segments from 36 seconds to 60 seconds, using ultra-fine sampling with custom bit-level decoding algorithms to try to extract potential embedded data structures.

=== LIMITATIONS/DISCUSSION ===
The proposed method is based on the time-frequency characteristics of the audio signal. If the energy distribution of the suspicious segment is significantly different from that of the normal speech, it can be considered as a potential embedded region of synchronization marker frames. The characteristics include: the periodic signal jumps but maintains a stable bandwidth; accompanied by an increase in the bottom noise and a decrease in spectral jitter; inconsistent with the background noise in the preceding and following time periods, and disconnected from the frequency characteristics of natural speech. Based on the above observations, it is preliminarily determined that this segment is an embedded region of potential synchronization marker frames.

The experimental results show that in the 36-45 second band, the peak spectral distribution of this band shows a significant stable signal, whose periodicity is far more than that of the natural voice, and a synchronized steganography structure is suspected to exist. The characteristics include: the periodic signal jumps but maintains a stable bandwidth; accompanied by an increase in the bottom noise and a decrease in spectral jitter; inconsistent with the background noise in the preceding and following time periods, and disconnected from the frequency characteristics of the natural voice. Based on the above observations, it is preliminarily determined that this segment is an embedded region of potential synchronization marker frames.

The experimental results show that in the 36-45 second band, the peak spectral distribution of this band shows a significant increase in energy in the 3000-3700 Hz band. The high concentration of the excess energy region (orange area) suggests a significant structure rather than random energy fluctuations. In contrast, the energy in the normal band is generally smooth, further confirming that there is usually no significant acoustic activity in this band under normal conditions. Such sharp energy concentration is usually a typical frequency domain manifestation of audio steganography or embedded protocol design, which can be used for machine learning feature selection or manual protocol backpropagation, providing a strong empirical basis for audio steganography detection.

The results of the analysis of this mapping further validate at the point we have made in this section that a audio signal has an unnatural concentration of energy in the high-frequency signal between 36-45 seconds. This anomaly in energy distribution contrasts with the smooth characteristics of normal audio signals, providing strong support for the hypothesis of the existence of audio steganography by embedding and is further reinforced by the near-zero energy difference with the rest of the band. Such sharp energy concentration is usually a typical frequency domain manifestation of audio steganography or embedded protocol design, which can be used for machine learning feature selection or manual protocol backpropagation, providing a strong empirical basis for audio steganography detection.

The experimental results show that in the 36-45 second band, the peaks spectral distribution of this band shows a significant increase in energy in the 3.2-3.6 kHz frequency range, which can be considered as the "main carrier region" of the spectrum for embedded signals. The high concentration of the excess energy region (orange area) suggests a significant structure rather than random energy fluctuations. In contrast, the energy in the normal band is generally smooth, further confirming that there is usually no significant acoustic activity in this band under normal conditions.

The experimental results show that the energy distribution of the audio signal in the 2-4 kHz band is analyzed in detail. The horizontal axis of the plot is the frequency (Hz), ranging from 2000 Hz to 4000 Hz, and the verticalaxisistheaverageenergyvalue,reflectingtheenergyintensityofeachfrequencypointin a given time period. The gray curverepresents the energy of the normal speech segment, which is very low and has no significant fluctuation, while the blue curve represents the energy of the abnormal speech segment, with a significant spike at about 3230 Hz, and the yellow filled area highlights the "excess" of an anomalous energy compared to the normal segment at this frequency. This anomalous spike suggests that the 3230Hz frequency is used for signal modulation or embedding and is highly structured, and its unnatural character is further reinforced by the near-zero energy difference with the rest of the band.
