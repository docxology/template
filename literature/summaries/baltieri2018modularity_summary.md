**Overview/Summary**

The paper by Pezzulo et al. (2017) is a comprehensive review of the literature on the relationship between action and perception. The authors argue that the modularity of action and perception, which is the idea that the brain has separate systems for controlling actions and perceiving sensory information, is an outdated concept. They present a new perspective based on the optimal control theory framework that shows how the same neural mechanisms can be used to both generate motor commands and to estimate the state of the environment. The authors' main argument is that the forward models in the brain are not only for perception but also for action. This idea is supported by the fact that the same neural mechanisms are involved in both generating motor commands and estimating the state of the environment, as well as the fact that the optimal control theory can be applied to both the motor system and the sensory system. The authors' main contribution is a new perspective on the role of forward models in the sensorimotor system.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The paper reviews the literature on the modularity of action and perception, which is the idea that the brain has separate systems for controlling actions and perceiving sensory information. The authors argue that this concept is outdated because it does not take into account the fact that the same neural mechanisms are involved in both generating motor commands and estimating the state of the environment. They present a new perspective based on the optimal control theory framework that shows how the same neural mechanisms can be used to both generate motor commands and to estimate the state of the environment. The authors' main argument is that the forward models in the brain are not only for perception but also for action. This idea is supported by the fact that the same neural mechanisms are involved in both generating motor commands and estimating the state of the environment, as well as the fact that the optimal control theory can be applied to both the motor system and the sensory system.
