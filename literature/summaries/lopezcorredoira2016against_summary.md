**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Against free will in the contemporary natural sciences" by [Author] is a philosophical critique of the concept of free will in the context of modern scientific theories. The author argues that the notion of free will, which has been central to discussions on human behavior and moral responsibility for centuries, is not compatible with our current understanding of the world as described by the laws of physics. The paper begins by pointing out that the natural sciences have traditionally considered the mind-body problem to be a matter of philosophy rather than science, and that the scientific method cannot be applied to this question. This has led to a lack of rigorous analysis in the field. However, with the development of modern physics, particularly quantum mechanics, it is now possible to apply the scientific method to the question of free will.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The author's main argument is that the concept of free will is incompatible with our current understanding of the world as described by the laws of physics. The paper starts by pointing out that the natural sciences have traditionally considered the mind-body problem to be a matter of philosophy rather than science, and that the scientific method cannot be applied to this question.

However, with the development of modern physics, particularly quantum mechanics, it is now possible to apply the scientific method to the question of free will. The author's main argument is that the concept of free will is incompatible with our current understanding of the world as described by the laws of physics. The author argues that this incompatibility is not a problem for science or philosophy because the mind-body problem is not a problem for either field. The author also suggests that the question of free will may be resolved if we are willing to accept the implications of our current understanding of the world, and that the traditional view of the human being as a non-physical entity with consciousness and free will is no longer tenable.

**Methodology/Approach**

The paper's methodology is philosophical. The author does not present any empirical data or experimental results. Instead, the paper presents an argument based on the current state of our knowledge in physics.
