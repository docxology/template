**Overview/Summary**

The paper introduces a novel autonomous vehicle (AV) navigation framework that can handle unstructured environments and adapt to new data in real-time. The proposed framework, called the Diffusion-Based Active Inference Framework (AIF), is a three-phase process consisting of forward diffusion, reversed diffusion, and active inference control. It uses a physics-informed variational autoencoder (VAE) model for motion prediction in the first two phases, with the third phase using the VFE to decide the most probable action that minimizes the expected free energy (EFE). The AIF is trained on data collected from a simulation environment and validated through real-world driving. The forward diffusion process collects vehicle trajectory data by simulating random actions such as steering and throttle adjustments in a parking lot with two or four cars, while the reversed diffusion process uses this data to predict previous states and actions from current states. In the active inference control phase, the reverse model is refined when it fails to properly predict. The refined reverse model and AIF then decide the most probable action that minimizes the EFE until the vehicle reaches its destination.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this paper are the three-phase AIF framework and the physics-informed VAE motion predictor. The forward diffusion process collects data by simulating random actions such as steering and throttle adjustments in a parking lot with two or four cars, while the reversed diffusion process uses this data to predict previous states and actions from current states. In the active inference control phase, the reverse model is refined when it fails to properly predict. The refined reverse model and AIF then decide the most probable action that minimizes the EFE until the vehicle reaches its destination.

**Methodology/Approach**

The forward diffusion process collects data by simulating random actions such as steering and throttle adjustments in a parking lot with two or four cars, while the reversed diffusion process uses this data to predict previous states and actions from current states. In the active inference control phase, the reverse model is refined when it fails to properly predict. The refined reverse model and AIF then decide the most probable action that minimizes the EFE until the vehicle reaches its destination.

**Results/Data**

The first part of the simulation results describes the simulation environment set up within 'highway-env'. This setup provides the foundational context for subsequent testing and analysis. In the second segment, a detailed analysis of the diffusion model's performance is presented. Finally, we examine the simulation outcomes where the model's practical efficacy is showcased through its application in controlling vehicles. These simulations underscore the model's potential contributions to autonomous vehicle navigation, particularly in unstructured environments.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The main limitation of this paper is that it does not provide a detailed comparison with other motion prediction methods. The authors also do not mention whether the proposed AIF can be applied for more complex scenarios such as intersection or highway driving. In addition, the paper only provides an overview of the simulation environment and the results from these simulations are expected to provide insightful data on the potential of AIF in the field of autonomous vehicle navigation, particularly in unstructured environments.
