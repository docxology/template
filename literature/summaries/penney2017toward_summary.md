**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Toward Foraging for Understanding of StarCraft Agents" is a study in the field of artificial intelligence and multi-agent systems. The authors investigate how humans understand the behavior of agents that are programmed to play the game StarCraft, which is a popular real-time strategy game that involves a large number of interacting agents (units) on a map. In this paper, the authors aim at understanding human's ability in interpreting the behavior of an agent and its decision-making process from the observation of the game state. The main goal of this study is to identify what information environment is most useful for humans to understand the behavior of an agent and how it can be used to train a better agent. In this paper, the authors propose a novel approach called "Foraging" that makes use of human's ability in understanding the behavior of an agent from the observation of the game state. The main idea of the Foraging is to make humans learn the decision-making process of an agent by observing its behavior and then train an agent based on this learning. In this paper, the authors propose a novel approach that makes use of human's ability in understanding the behavior of an agent from the observation of the game state.
