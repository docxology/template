**Overview/Summary**
The paper "Free energy and inference in living systems" by [Authors] is a comprehensive study on the free energy principle (FEP) that provides an explanation for the spontaneous emergence of complex behaviors in biological systems, such as the brain's ability to infer from sensory data. The authors present a novel theory based on the FEP, which they argue is a fundamental principle for understanding living systems and their behavior. They show how the FEP can be used to explain the brain's ability to make inferences about its environment and its own state. The paper also presents a numerical study of the latent dynamics of the brain's sensorimotor system based on the Hamiltonian principle, which is an alternative approach for the FEP minimization.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The main findings of this work are the following: (1) A novel theory that provides an explanation for the spontaneous emergence of complex behaviors in biological systems. The authors argue that the free energy principle can be used to explain how the brain is able to make inferences about its environment and its own state. This is a fundamental problem in understanding living systems, which has been addressed by many researchers using various approaches. (2) A numerical study of the latent dynamics of the brain's sensorimotor system based on the Hamiltonian principle that provides an alternative approach for the FEP minimization. The authors show how the FEP can be used to explain the brain's ability to make inferences about its environment and its own state. This is a fundamental problem in understanding living systems, which has been addressed by many researchers using various approaches.

**Methodology/Approach**
The approach of this paper is based on the free energy principle (FEP) that provides an explanation for the spontaneous emergence of complex behaviors in biological systems. The authors present a novel theory based on the FEP. They show how the FEP can be used to explain the brain's ability to make inferences about its environment and its own state. This is a fundamental problem in understanding living systems, which has been addressed by many researchers using various approaches. The paper also presents a numerical study of the latent dynamics of the brain's sensorimotor system based on the Hamiltonian principle that provides an alternative approach for the FEP minimization.

**Results/Data**
The authors present a numerical study of the latent dynamics of the brain's sensorimotor system based on the Hamiltonian principle. The authors show how the FEP can be used to explain the brain's ability to make inferences about its environment and its own state. This is a fundamental problem in understanding living systems, which has been addressed by many researchers using various approaches.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The main weakness of this work is that it does not address how the parameters are learned or amortized over the developmental and evolutionary time scales. The authors assume that the optimal parameters were already learned or amortized over the developmental and evolutionary time scales; these param eters are assumed to be shared for generating present and future sensory data. This means that the proposed parsimonious BM still encloses 10 parameters, which deﬁne a multidimensional parameter space to explore for learning. The authors do not pursue the active inference problem in this study but should be explored in future investigations.
