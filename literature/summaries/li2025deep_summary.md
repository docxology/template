**Overview/Summary**
The paper presents a new method for calculating the free energy of hydrogen in a many-body system using a deep learning approach. The authors first calculate the conditional probabilities of ideal fermions on Hartree-Fock (HF) single-particle states, which are then used as the starting point to model the electron excitation distribution over the HF energy levels when nuclear coordinates are given. This is achieved by combining the results from the calculation of the conditional probabilities with a masked logit 

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The authors first develop a new method to calculate the conditional probabilities of ideal fermions on HF single-particle states. The main idea is that the free energy can be calculated as a sum over all possible configurations of the system, and the Boltzmann weight for each configuration is given by the ratio of the partition functions with and without the interaction. This is achieved by combining the results from the calculation of the conditional probabilities with a masked logit

**Results/Data**
The authors first calculate the conditional probabilities ofN-ideal fermion systems on the HF orbitals.

This is achieved by combining the results from the calculation of the conditional probabilities with a masked logit 

**Limitations/Discussion**
The authors use the variational free energy method to calculate the free energy. The main idea is that the free energy can be calculated as a sum over all possible configurations of the system, and the Boltzmann weight for each configuration is given by the ratio of the partition functions with and without the interaction.
