**Overview/Summary**

The principle of stationary action is a fundamental concept in physics that has been successfully applied to many different types of physical systems. The authors of this paper aim to show that the same principle can also be used for neural systems, and they provide a general framework for doing so. They start by discussing the standard model of particle physics, which is based on the variational principle. This is the statement that the action (a mathematical function) takes its minimum value in a physical system when it is stationary. The action is defined as the integral over time of the Lagrangian (the difference between kinetic and potential energy). The authors then discuss how this concept can be applied to other types of systems, such as those described by the Hodgkin-Huxley equations for neurons. They show that the standard model of particle physics can also be used in these cases, but with a different action. In the case of the Hodgkin-Huxley system, the action is not the integral over time of the Lagrangian, but rather the integral over space and time of the Lagrangian. The authors then discuss how this concept can be applied to other neural systems (such as those described by the integrate-and-fire equations), and they show that the same principle applies in these cases too. They also provide a general framework for doing so. The main point is that the standard model of particle physics can be used for all types of physical systems, including those with many different types of interactions.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors' first main finding is that the variational principle (i.e., the statement that the action takes its minimum value when it is stationary) applies to a wide variety of different types of physical systems. The second main point is that the standard model can be used for all these different types of systems, and the only difference between them is in what the action is. This is the Lagrangian (the difference between kinetic and potential energy), which is an integral over time, but it is also a function of the spatial coordinates. In the case of the Hodgkin-Huxley system, the action is not the integral over time of the Lagrangian, but rather the integral over space and time of the Lagrangian. The authors' second main finding is that the same principle applies in all these different cases.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors start by discussing the standard model of particle physics, which is based on the variational principle. They then discuss how this concept can be applied to other types of systems, such as those described by the Hodgkin-Huxley equations for neurons. The authors show that the standard model can also be used in these cases, but with a different action. In the case of the Hodgkin-Huxley system, the action is not the integral over time of the Lagrangian, but rather the integral over space and time of the Lagrangian. They then discuss how this concept can be applied to other neural systems (such as those described by the integrate-and-fire equations), and they show that the same principle applies in these cases too. The authors also provide a general framework for doing so.

**Results/Data**

The main result is that the standard model of particle physics can be used for all types of physical systems, including those with many different types of interactions. This is demonstrated by showing how this concept applies to the Hodgkin-Huxley system and other neural systems (such as integrate-and-fire equations). The authors also provide a general framework for doing so.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors' first point is that the variational principle (i.e., the statement that the action takes its minimum value when it is stationary) applies to a wide variety of different types of physical systems. The second main finding is that the standard model can be used for all these different types of systems, and the only difference between them is in what the action is. This is the Lagrangian (the difference between kinetic and potential energy), which is an integral over time, but it is also a function of the spatial coordinates. In the case of the Hodgkin-Huxley system, the action is not the integral over time of the Lagrangian, but rather the integral over space and time of the Lagrangian. The authors' second main finding is that the same principle applies in all these different cases.
