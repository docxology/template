**Overview/Summary**

The authors present a mathematical model of ant foraging behavior using a system of partial differential equations (PDEs) in the framework of chemotaxis. The PDEs are based on the idea that ants deposit pheromones as they move, and these pheromones attract other ants to follow the same path. This process is thought to be important for food recruitment in the presence of a single food source. The authors show numerically that this system exhibits spontaneous trail formation in the presence of food sources. They also present a whole cycle of food foraging, from ants emerging from a nest onto a foraging ground where food is placed, discovering the food and returning to the nest laying pheromones. Recruitment then takes place with foraging ants being attracted in the vicinity of the nest to the pheromones laid previously by the returning ants. A feedback loop ensues as more ants reach the food source and return to the nest laying pheromones, and finally when the food source is exhausted the trail fades away due to the natural evaporation of the pheromone.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors' main contributions are the development of a mathematical model that can be used to study the process of trail formation in the presence of multiple food sources. The model is based on a system of PDEs with nonlinear terms, which makes it more difficult to analyze than the linear models that have been previously studied. They present numerical results for this model and show that the qualitative behavior of the solutions are similar to those found in the previous studies. In particular, they observe spontaneous trail formation in the presence of a single food source, and the trails fade away when the food is exhausted.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors' approach is based on the idea that ants deposit pheromones as they move, and these pheromones attract other ants to follow the same path. The process of trail formation in the presence of a single food source has been previously studied using linear PDEs. In this paper, the authors use nonlinear PDEs for their model. This makes it more difficult to analyze than the previous studies. The authors present numerical results that show the qualitative behavior of the solutions are similar to those found in the previous studies. They also compare their results with the results from the previous studies.

**Results/Data**

The authors' main result is a numerical simulation for their model. In this section, they present the details of the numerical method and the results. The authors use a finite volume method on a square grid with standard Euler time-stepping. For the simulations presented here, they used a time step of 0.0005 for 300,000 iterations with 40,000 spatial cells.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The main limitation is that the paper does not provide any theoretical results for their model. The authors do not discuss the limitations of their work or suggest future research directions in this section.
