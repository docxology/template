**Overview/Summary**

The paper presents an experimental study on the convergence of ant colony optimization (ACO) for solving the vehicle routing problem (VRP). The authors investigate the effectiveness and efficiency of ACO in solving VRP, which is a well-known NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. In this paper, the authors use the basic ACO algorithm to solve the VRP with 50 customers and 100 customers. The experimental results show that the convergence speed of ACO is faster than the simulated annealing (SA) and tabu search (TS) algorithms. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: First, the authors give a detailed description on how to use the basic ACO algorithm for solving the VRP. Second, the authors compare the performance of the ACO with SA and TS by using the same experimental data. Third, the authors analyze the reasons why the convergence speed of the ACO is faster than that of the SA and TS algorithms. Finally, the authors suggest some future work.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contribution of this paper is to compare the performance of the basic ACO algorithm with the SA and TS algorithms by using the same experimental data. The results show that the convergence speed of the ACO is faster than that of the SA and TS algorithms. This paper also gives a detailed description on how to use the basic ACO algorithm for solving the VRP.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors compare the performance of the ACO with the SA and TS by using the same experimental data. The authors first describe the basic ACO algorithm. Then, the authors give an example to illustrate the application of the basic ACO algorithm in the VRP. Finally, the authors compare the performance of the ACO with the SA and TS algorithms.

**Results/Data**

The results show that the convergence speed of the ACO is faster than that of the SA and TS algorithms. The experimental data are from the literature [11]. In this paper, the authors use 50 customers and 100 customers to test the performance of the ACO. The authors compare the performance of the ACO with the SA and TS by using the same experimental data.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The main limitation of this paper is that it only gives a comparison between the basic ACO algorithm and the SA and TS algorithms. This paper does not give any theoretical analysis on the convergence speed of the ACO. The authors do not analyze why the convergence speed of the ACO is faster than that of the SA and TS algorithms. The authors suggest some future work, such as: 1) to give a detailed description on how to use the basic ACO algorithm for solving the VRP; 2) to compare the performance of the ACO with the SA and TS by using the same experimental data; 3) to analyze why the convergence speed of the ACO is faster than that of the SA and TS algorithms.
