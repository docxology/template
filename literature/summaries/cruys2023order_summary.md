**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Order and change in art: towards an active inference" by [Author] is a philosophical inquiry into the nature of contemporary art that attempts to provide a definition of beauty as a genus of value within which we can distinguish several distinct, but compatible species. The author argues that the purpose of art is to expand our possibilities for action and satisfaction (freedom) in an absolute sense rather than relative to existing desires or purposes. This paper is not concerned with the usual debates about the definition of art, its history, or its relationship to other forms of human expression. Instead, it is a contribution to the contemporary debate about the value of art that has been revealed by the history of art's struggle to define itself.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The author argues that the purpose of art is not to satisfy existing desires and communicate existing ideas, but to stimulate the production of new desires and ideas. This means that it does not aim at the local enhancement of freedom (as with craft), but rather the global enhancement of freedom. The paper's main contribution is a definition of beauty as an absolute unconditional value that provides reasons for action that are in some sense independent of other motivations such as personal desires or common purposes. The author also argues that this absolute unconditionality can be understood as the enhancement of freedom, and that art is less about the freedom to experiment than it is about experimentation with freedom.

**Methodology/Approach**

The paper does not follow a traditional methodology. It is a philosophical inquiry into the nature of contemporary art that attempts to provide a definition of beauty. The author's approach is based on an analysis of the history of art and its struggle to define itself, and it is this historical consciousness that the paper maintains.

**Results/Data**

The paper does not report any data or results. It is a philosophical inquiry into the nature of contemporary art that attempts to provide a definition of beauty.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The author argues that the critical question for the institutions of contemporary art (galleries, museums, etc.) is whether this infrastructural dimension of art has begun to overshadow its true source of value, which is the undefined work of freedom. The paper does not discuss any limitations or future research directions.
