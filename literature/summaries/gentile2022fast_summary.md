**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Fast Rates in Pool-Baseed Batch Active Learning" by Katz-Samuelson et al. (2022) proposes a new active learning algorithm that efficiently acquires labels for a pool-based batch active learning scenario, where the goal is to label a large number of unlabeled samples with a limited budget. The authors first provide an overview of the current state-of-the-art in this area and then describe their proposed method. They also compare it with other methods on several datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contribution of this paper is a new algorithm for batch active learning that can achieve fast rates by using an acquisition function that is adaptive to the data distribution. The authors first show that the current state-of-the-art in pool-based batch active learning is not efficient, and then propose a new method called "Fast Rates" (FR). This method uses an acquisition function that is adaptive to the data distribution. They also compare it with other methods on several datasets.
