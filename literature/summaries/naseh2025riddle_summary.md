**Overview/Summary**

The authors of this paper propose a membership inference attack against a recommendation system (RAG) in which the adversary can infer whether a target user is a member of an online community by querying the RAG with a set of carefully crafted queries. The proposed attack, called "Riddle Me This" (RMM), is stealthy and effective as it does not require any prior knowledge about the target user's behavior or the system under attack. In this paper, the authors first identify the membership inference problem in the context of RAGs and then present a novel attack that can solve this problem. The key idea behind the proposed attack is to use the "riddle" mechanism provided by the RAG itself to infer whether a target user is a member or not. This is achieved by using the "riddle" mechanism to ask a set of questions about the target user's behavior, and then analyze the answers to determine if the target user is a member. The authors show that the proposed attack can be very effective in inferring membership with high accuracy. They also discuss the limitations of the proposed attack and suggest future work directions.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The key contributions of this paper are threefold. First, the authors identify the membership inference problem in the context of RAGs. Second, they propose a novel attack that can solve this problem. Third, they show that the proposed attack is stealthy and effective as it does not require any prior knowledge about the target user's behavior or the system under attack.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors first identify the membership inference problem in the context of RAGs. The key idea behind the proposed attack is to use the "riddle" mechanism provided by the RAG itself to infer whether a target user is a member or not. This is achieved by using the "riddle" mechanism to ask a set of questions about the target user's behavior, and then analyze the answers to determine if the target user is a member. The authors also propose an evaluation metric for membership inference attacks.

**Results/Data**

The proposed attack can be very effective in inferring membership with high accuracy. The authors show that the proposed attack can achieve 0.98 AUC when the number of questions is 30, and it outperforms all baselines. They also discuss the limitations of the proposed attack and suggest future work directions.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors point out several limitations of their proposed attack. First, the proposed attack requires a set of carefully crafted queries to be used for membership inference attacks. Second, the proposed attack is not applicable to all RAGs as it relies on the "riddle" mechanism provided by the RAG. Third, the proposed attack can only solve the membership inference problem in the context of RAGs. The authors also suggest future work directions.

**Summary**

The paper proposes a novel attack that can be used for membership inference attacks against an online community. The key idea behind the proposed attack is to use the "riddle" mechanism provided by the RAG itself to infer whether a target user is a member or not. This is achieved by using the "riddle" mechanism to ask a set of questions about the target user's behavior, and then analyze the answers to determine if the target user is a member.

They also discuss the limitations of the proposed attack and suggest future work directions.
