**Overview/Summary**
The free energy principle is a mathematical framework for understanding how an organism's brain and body can be viewed as performing inference. The paper presents this idea in the context of a particular partitioning of the probability distribution over internal and external states, where the internal states are the active and sensory states that make up the organism. In this case, the free energy principle is presented as a basis for understanding how the organism's brain can be viewed as performing Bayesian belief updating. The main claim of the paper is that an autonomous path of least action can be expressed in terms of a variational free energy that can be read as log evidence. This is made possible by the symmetric setup of the Markov blanket, which means that the internal and external states are equivalent. The internal states do not influence the sensory  (or external) states, so they will look as if they are concerned purely with inference. However, the active states can influence the sensory  (and external) states and will look as if they play an active role in configuring  (and causing) the sensory states that underwrite inference. The paper presents this idea through a teleological description of self-organisation as self-evidencing. This is because the internal states do not influence the sensory  (or external) states, so they will look as if they are concerned purely with inference. However, active states can influence the sensory  (and external) states and will look as if they play an active role in configuring  (and causing) the sensory states that underwrite inference.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The main contribution of this paper is to present the free energy principle in a way that makes it more accessible but not too simple. The first part of the paper is concerned with the teleological description of self-organisation as self-evidencing, where the internal and external states are equivalent. This means that the internal  (and active) and sensory  (or external) states can be viewed in a symmetric way. The second part of the paper is concerned with the free energy principle itself. It presents this idea through the lens of Bayesian filtering. In this case, there is no contribution from the KL- divergence as it is stipulated to be zero. This means that the dynamics of  (17) and variational inference are different. The former is a basis for understanding how an organism's brain can be viewed as performing Bayesian belief updating. However, there is a subtle difference between the dynamics of  (17) and variational inference. In the former, there is no contribution from the KL- divergence as it is stipulated to be zero. In the latter, it is only the divergence term that contributes to free energy gradients. So, is it tenable to interpret gradient flows on variational free energy as variational inference, or is this just teleological window-dressing? The next section addresses this question through the lens of Bayesian filtering.

**Methodology/Approach**
The paper does not present a new method for performing inference. Instead, it presents the idea that an autonomous path of least action can be expressed in terms of a variational free energy that can be read as log evidence. This is made possible by the symmetric setup of the Markov blanket, which means that the internal and external states are equivalent.
