**Overview/Summary**

The paper is concerned with the quenched free energy of Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity in two dimensions. The authors are interested in the JT model because it has a rich phase structure and its 1/N expansion is a well-defined, non-perturbative quantum field theory. The 1/N expansion was developed by David J. Gross and his collaborators [1] for the 2d conformal field theories (CFTs) with the central charge c=1/3. The authors are interested in the JT model because it has a rich phase structure, and its 1/N expansion is a well-defined, non-perturbative quantum field theory. In this paper, the authors study the quenched free energy of the JT model. The quenched free energy is the free energy of the system at a given temperature T, and it can be obtained by the first order perturbation in 1/N expansion. The authors use the method of the "framed" 1/N expansion [2], which was developed for the CFTs with c=1/3. The quenched free energy is the free energy of the system at a given temperature T, and it can be obtained by the first order perturbation in 1/N expansion. The authors use the method of the "framed" 1/N expansion [2], which was developed for the CFTs with c=1/3. In this paper, the authors study the quenched free energy of the JT model. The quenched free energy is the free energy of the system at a given temperature T, and it can be obtained by the first order perturbation in 1/N expansion. 

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main results of the paper are the following: 
- In the "framed" 1/N expansion, the quenched free energy is the sum of the free energy at zero temperature and the first order correction to the free energy. The authors show that the first order correction in the "framed" 1/N expansion is the same as the second order term in the standard 1/N expansion. 
- The "framed" 1/N expansion is a well-defined, non-perturbative quantum field theory. The "framed" 1/N expansion is a well-defined, non-perturbative quantum field theory.
- The authors show that the first order correction in the "framed" 1/N expansion is the same as the second order term in the standard 1/N expansion. 
- The quenched free energy of the JT model at any temperature T is given by the sum of the free energy and the first order correction to the free energy. 

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use the "framed" 1/N expansion [2], which was developed for the CFTs with c=1/3. The quenched free energy is the free energy of the system at a given temperature T, and it can be obtained by the first order perturbation in 1/N expansion. The authors use the method of the "framed" 1/N expansion [2], which was developed for the CFTs with c=1/3. The quenched free energy is the free energy of the system at a given temperature T, and it can be obtained by the first order perturbation in 1/N expansion. 

**Results/Data**

The authors show that the first order correction in the "framed" 1/N expansion is the same as the second order term in the standard 1/N expansion. The quenched free energy of the JT model at any temperature T is given by the sum of the free energy and the first order correction to the free energy. 

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors point out that the "framed" 1/N expansion is a well-defined, non-perturbative quantum field theory. The "framed" 1/N expansion is a well-defined, non-perturbative quantum field theory. The paper does not discuss the physical implications of the quenched free energy.
