**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Realising Active Inference in Variational Message Passing" by Champion et al. (2022) [1] is a seminal work that provides a novel perspective on the classic inference problem. The authors propose a new approach to the active inference problem, which they call "realising active inference", and demonstrate it with variational message passing (VMP). This paper reviews the key contributions of this work in detail.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of the VMP algorithm. The authors show that the VMP algorithm can be used to realise the active inference problem, which is a more general and challenging version of the classic inference problem. This is achieved by representing future observations as latent variables in the VMP framework. In this way, the VMP algorithm can be used for both the classic and the active inference problems. The authors also show that the VMP algorithm has some advantages over the existing algorithms.

**Methodology/Approach**

The paper starts with a brief overview of the classic inference problem. It then introduces the active inference problem, which is a more general version of the classic inference problem. The authors explain why the classic inference problem can be solved by the variational message passing (VMP) algorithm and how the VMP algorithm can be used to solve the active inference problem. In this way, the paper shows that the VMP algorithm has some advantages over the existing algorithms.

**Results/Data**

The paper then provides a detailed analysis of the VMP algorithm for both the classic and the active inference problems. The authors show that the VMP algorithm is an efficient method to solve the active inference problem. They also compare the VMP with the existing algorithms in this way, which shows the advantages of the VMP.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The paper discusses some limitations of the VMP algorithm and future work. The authors point out that the VMP algorithm can be used for both the classic and the active inference problems, but it is not a panacea to solve all the problems in this area. It also points out the potential applications of the VMP algorithm.
