**Overview/Summary**

The paper discusses the speed of sound in high energy density systems, a topic that is relevant to the study of the early universe and the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formed at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The authors use the Landau hydrodynamic model with an equation of state (EoS) that is determined by the number of degrees of freedom in the system. They compare the speed of sound to the Mach cone, which is a feature of the QGP and the early universe. The paper also discusses the EoS dependence of the Mach cone, and the results are compared with those from holographic models.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors find that the speed of sound in the Landau hydrodynamic model depends on the number of degrees of freedom in the system. They compare their results to the results from the AdS/CFT correspondence, which is a theoretical framework for the QGP and the early universe. The authors also discuss the EoS dependence of the Mach cone, and the results are compared with those from the AdS/CFT correspondence.
