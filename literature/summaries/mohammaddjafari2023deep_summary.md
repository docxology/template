**Overview/Summary**
The paper "Deep Learning and Bayesian inference for Inverse Problems" is a comprehensive review of recent advances in deep learning (DL) and Bayesian inference (BI) for inverse problems in imaging. The authors focus on the development of DL and BI methods that can be used to solve forward and inverse problems involving partial differential equations (PDEs), integral equations, and optimization problems. They also discuss the advantages and limitations of these approaches.
