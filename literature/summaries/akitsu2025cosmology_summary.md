**Overview/Summary**
The paper presents a novel approach to cosmology inference with perturbative forward modeling. The authors first introduce the concept of the "forward model" in the context of cosmological parameter estimation and discuss its importance for future surveys. They then describe their new method, which is based on the idea that the likelihood function can be approximated by a Gaussian distribution if the posterior distribution of the parameters is not too narrow. The authors also present two different ways to use this approach: one is to use it as an approximation in the analysis of real data and the other is to use it for the construction of mock catalogs, which are used to test the method. In the first case, they apply their new method to a set of mock catalogs that were generated with a forward model based on the same cosmological parameters as the one used in the analysis of the real data. The second case is to use the new method for the construction of the real data itself. They also compare the results obtained by the two different methods.
