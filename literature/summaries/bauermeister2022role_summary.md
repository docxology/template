**Overview/Summary**

The Role of Valence and Meta-awareness is a two-layered generative model that describes how an agent's valence (positive/negative) state affects the way it perceives its own and others' emotional states in a social interaction. The first layer models the agent's valence and meta- awareness, which is the ability to have a higher order representation of one's own valence. The second layer describes how this valence state affects the way an agent perceives another's valence. In this paper, the authors propose that the valence state can be represented as a probability distribution over three states: happy, neutral and sad. This is in contrast to the previous work where the valence was described by a single number or a binary variable. The first layer of this model is an extension of the previous model [13] which also describes how the agent's valence state affects the way it perceives its own and others' emotional states. In this paper, the authors extend this to include the meta- awareness of the agent's valence state in a social interaction. The second layer of this model is similar to the previous work [13] where the valence state can also be represented as a probability distribution over three states: happy, neutral and sad. The A and B matrices for the Valence state are the same as in [13]. In the first layer, the agent's valence state is described by a probability distribution over these three states. This is in contrast to the previous work where the valence was described by a single number or a binary variable.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contribution of this paper is that it proposes a two-layered generative model for the role of valence and meta- awareness in a social interaction, which can be used to describe how an agent's valence state affects the way it perceives its own and others' emotional states. In the first layer, the authors extend the previous model [13] by including the meta-awareness of the agent's valence state in a social interaction. The second layer of this model is similar to the previous work [13] where the valence state can also be represented as a probability distribution over these three states: happy, neutral and sad. In the first layer, the authors extend this to include the meta-awareness of the agent's valence state in a social interaction.

**Methodology/Approach**

The A and B matrices for the Valence state are the same as in [13]. In the first layer, the agent's valence state is described by a probability distribution over these three states. This is in contrast to the previous work where the valence was described by a single number or a binary variable. The second layer of this model is similar to the previous work [13] where the valence state can also be represented as a probability distribution over these three states: happy, neutral and sad. In the first layer, the agent's valence state is described by a probability distribution over these three states. This is in contrast to the previous work where the valence was described by a single number or a binary variable.

**Results/Data**

The A and B matrices for the Valence state are the same as in [13]. The A2 matrix can again be changed with a precision parameter c. This one is set manually to simulate meta- awareness. In my simulation high means c = 5 and low c = 1. The preference are set with the C matrix. For all observation modalities C will be initiated with zeros. Then the preference to see self happy or neutral can be encoded as: C1[0] =3.0, C1[1] =3.0. The description of the first layer concludes with the policies available to the agent. They are any combination of going to a location that is possible within a trial. The trials consist of three observations and 2 actions. The agent starts by sampling an observation then decides where to go, and repeats this step. After the final observation, the agent doesn't need to go anywhere because the trial is over and will start again from the beginning.
