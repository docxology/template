Title: Positive-Unlabeled Learning for Control Group Construction in Observational Causal Inference


Abstract: We propose a novel approach to construct control groups from positive-unlabeled data, which is common in many real-world applications. The core idea of our method is to learn the propensity score by using the positive-unlabeled training set and then apply it to select the control group. This approach can be applied to both the original causal inference problem and the doubly robust estimation. We theoretically prove that our proposed approach is consistent and asymptotically unbiased, and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness in a variety of synthetic and real-world datasets. Our method is also interpretable as we can learn the decision boundary from the model trained on the positive-unlabeled data. The learned propensity score is also useful for other causal inference problems such as the doubly robust estimation. We conduct extensive experiments to show that our proposed approach outperforms the existing methods in terms of both the effectiveness and the interpretability. Our method can be applied to a wide range of datasets, including the ones with different types of data distributions. The code is available at https://github.com/chenxu1990/PULC.
