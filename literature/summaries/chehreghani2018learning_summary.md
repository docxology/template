**Overview/Summary**
The paper "Learning Representations from Dendrograms" by [Authors] presents a new family of non-parametric feature extraction methods for clustering data. The authors propose to build the dendrogram based on the pairwise distances between all pairs of data points and then extract features from this dendrogram. They show that different ways of building the dendrogram lead to different types of features, and these features can be better than or at least as good as the baseline methods in many cases. The authors also propose an ensemble method which aggregates the results of different dendrogram-based feature extraction methods. The paper is organized as follows.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The main contributions of this paper are a new family of non-parametric feature extraction methods for clustering data, and the experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of these features in improving the evaluation scores of the final clusters. The authors propose to build the dendrogram based on the pairwise distances between all pairs of data points and then extract features from this dendrogram. They show that different ways of building the dendrogram lead to different types of features, and these features can be better than or at least as good as the baseline methods in many cases. The authors also propose an ensemble method which aggregates the results of different dendrogram-based feature extraction methods.

**Methodology/Approach**
The authors extract features from the dendrograms based on the pairwise distances between all pairs of data points and then apply a clustering algorithm to obtain the clusters. The authors use the correlation clustering (CC) algorithm in [20] as the baseline method. The CC algorithm is an unsupervised feature extraction method which extracts the features by maximizing the mutual information between the extracted features and the true labels. In this paper, the authors consider four different ways of building the dendrogram: single linkage (SL), complete linkage (CL), average linkage (AL) and Ward's minimum variance (WMV). The authors also propose an ensemble method which aggregates the results of different dendrogram-based feature extraction methods. The CC algorithm is an unsupervised feature extraction method which extracts the features by maximizing the mutual information between the extracted features and the true labels. In this paper, the authors consider four different ways of building the dendrogram: single linkage (SL), complete linkage (CL), average linkage (AL) and Ward's minimum variance (WMV). The authors also propose an ensemble method which aggregates the results of different dendrogram-based feature extraction methods.

**Results/Data**
The authors apply the CC algorithm to all the baseline features, including the original data, PCA and LSA. They also apply the CC algorithm to the four types of the SL-features (i.e., single linkage), CL-features, AL-features and WMV-features. The authors use the correlation clustering (CC) algorithm in [20] as the baseline method. The CC algorithm is an unsupervised feature extraction method which extracts the features by maximizing the mutual information between the extracted features and the true labels.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The paper does not discuss any limitations or future work.
