**Overview/Summary**
The paper proposes a novel auction mechanism called AERIA (Adaptive Edge Inference Auction for Resource Allocation) to allocate resources among multiple AI inference tasks in an on-demand manner. The authors consider the scenario where there are many AI tasks and limited computing resources, and propose a dynamic pricing strategy based on the first-price sealed-bid auction (FPSB) mechanism. The main contribution of this paper is that it can achieve the optimal allocation of computing resources among multiple competing AI inference tasks in an on-demand manner.
