**Overview/Summary**

The paper proposes a unified framework for inference in network models with dependent structures. The authors consider a class of exponential random graph (ERG) models that include both the classical Erdos-Renyi model and many other ERGMs with dependent structures, such as k-regular or triangle. The main contribution is to establish the consistency and asymptotic representation of the moment estimator for the degree parameters and homophily parameter in a class of ERGMs without specifying the joint distribution. This paper also establishes the central limit theorem (CLT) for the MLE when the edge independence assumption holds, which is not used in the proof of the main results.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors propose the moment estimator for inferring the degree parameters and homophily parameter in a class of ERGMs that only specify the marginal distribution. They establish the consistency of the moment estimator under several conditions and also derive its asymptotic representation. The edge independence assumption is not used in the proofs of the main results.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use Gragg and Tapia's (1974) result on the Newton method to obtain the rate of convergence for the MLE. They also use a result by Yan et al. (2015), which gives an upper bound of the approximation error when using S to approximate the inverse of V belonging to the matrix class Ln(m, M). The authors do not use the edge independence assumption in the proofs of the main results.

**Results/Data**

The authors establish the consistency and asymptotic representation of the moment estimator under several conditions. They also derive the CLT for the MLE when the edge independence assumption holds. In fact, the edge independence assumption is not used in the proofs of the main results. The authors do not use the edge independence assumption in their applications to verify Condition 1 and to derive the central limit theorem.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The conditions imposed in the theorems imply that κn can be allowed to increase only with a slow rate. What can be said when some of ∥zij∥∞’s are large? For example, some of the covariates information for edges may increase with a fast rate. If the proportion of large values of ∥zij∥∞’s is bounded, then this will have little eﬀect on the moment estimators when n is large, so that the consistency and asymptotic representation still hold. A more inter esting case is when the proportion of large ∥zij∥∞’s is not bounded, whether there are any asymptotic properties of the moment estimator. The authors plan to investigate this and other relat ed situations in the future.

**Summary/Conclusion**

The paper proposes a unified framework for inference in network models with dependent structures. The authors consider a class of exponential random graph (ERG) models that include both the classical Erdos-Renyi model and many other ERGMs with dependent structures, such as k-regular or triangle. The main contribution is to establish the consistency and asymptotic representation of the moment estimator for the degree parameters and homophily parameter in a class of ERGMs without specifying the joint distribution. This paper also establishes the central limit theorem (CLT) for the MLE when the edge independence assumption holds, which is not used in the proof of the main results.
