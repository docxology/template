**Overview/Summary**

The paper introduces a Bayesian model of selective attention based on the concept of "what" and "where". The authors propose that an agent's ability to selectively attend to different parts of the environment is determined by two distinct factors, what it is looking for (the task-relevant information) and where it should look. This is in contrast to previous models which only consider one or the other factor. In this paper, the authors show how these two factors can be combined within a single Bayesian framework. The model is applied to a visual search task where an agent must find a target object among distractors. The results of the simulation are compared with those obtained from human experiments and the performance of the model is found to be similar to that of humans.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The key contribution of this paper is the development of a Bayesian model for selective attention. This model is based on the idea that an agent's ability to selectively attend to different parts of the environment is determined by two distinct factors, what it is looking for (the task-relevant information) and where it should look. The authors show how these two factors can be combined within a single Bayesian framework. The model is applied to a visual search task where an agent must find a target object among distractors. The results of the simulation are compared with those obtained from human experiments and the performance of the model is found to be similar to that of humans.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors first introduce the concept of "what" and "where". They then describe how these two factors can be combined within a single Bayesian framework. The model is applied to a visual search task where an agent must find a target object among distractors. The results of the simulation are compared with those obtained from human experiments and the performance of the model is found to be similar to that of humans.

**Results/Data**

The authors first describe how the "what" factor can be combined into a single probability distribution over all possible outcomes. They then show how this distribution can be used in conjunction with the "where" factor, which is also represented as a probability distribution, to determine what an agent should look for and where it should look. The results of the simulation are compared with those obtained from human experiments and the performance of the model is found to be similar to that of humans.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors discuss how their model can be used in other contexts. They also mention some possible future work, such as using a more complex "what" distribution or adding an additional "where" factor for the agent's internal state. The authors also point out that there are many different ways to combine the "what" and "where" factors within the Bayesian framework.
