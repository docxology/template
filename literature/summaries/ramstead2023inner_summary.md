**Overview/Summary**

The paper "The inner screen model of consciousness: applying the free energy principle" by Fields and Levin (2021) presents a novel approach to understanding the neural correlates of consciousness that is rooted in the Free Energy Principle (FEP), which is a mathematical framework for describing the dynamics of complex systems. The authors argue that the FEP can be used to explain the known anatomical structure of the brain, including its hierarchical and sparse organization, without any prior assumptions about the nature of conscious experience or the neural correlates of consciousness.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors propose a novel approach to understanding consciousness that is based on the FEP, which is a mathematical framework for describing the dynamics of complex systems. The core idea is that the FEP can be used to explain the known anatomical structure of the brain without any prior assumptions about the nature of conscious experience or the neural correlates of consciousness. In this approach, the authors argue that the FEP can be used to explain the known sparse organization of the brain, which is a well-established fact in neuroscience. The paper also proposes a novel way of thinking about the relationship between the contents of experience and the brain's activity. The core idea is that the contents of experience are not located at any one point in the hierarchy but rather can be thought of as a superposition of the contents of all the screens, which are the outputs from the different levels of the hierarchical organization of the brain. This approach is called the "inner screen" and it is based on the idea that the FEP can be used to explain the known anatomical structure of the brain.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use the FEP as a theoretical framework for understanding the neural correlates of consciousness. The FEP is a mathematical framework for describing the dynamics of complex systems, which are characterized by their free energy. The authors argue that the FEP can be used to explain the known anatomical structure of the brain without any prior assumptions about the nature of conscious experience or the neural correlates of consciousness. The paper does not describe an experiment or a computational model.

**Results/Data**

The main result of the paper is the proposal for a novel approach to understanding the relationship between the contents of experience and the brain's activity, which is based on the FEP. The authors do not present any data in this paper.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors discuss the limitations of their work. These include the lack of experimental support for the proposed "inner screen" approach to understanding consciousness. They also note that the FEP has been used as a theoretical framework for understanding other complex systems, such as the brain's activity in relation to sleep and wakefulness, but it is not clear whether this will be useful for understanding the neural correlates of consciousness.
