**Overview/Summary**

The paper "An Active-Inference Approach to Second-Person" is a theoretical work in the field of cognitive neuroscience that aims to understand the neural basis of second-person interaction by applying an active-inference approach. The authors argue that the nested recursive structure of deep tree exploration and the dynamic, ever-evolving fluctuation in the action opportunities within second-person contexts entail two core things: (a) a higher computational demand on the evaluation and monitoring of transition probabilities, which elicits higher ACC activity; and (b) it results in more environmental variability and fluctuating states, which calls for an increased attunement of internal and proprioceptive systems. The authors also argue that the second-person approach exposes interoceptive and proprioceptive bodily processes that enable and transmit social interaction.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The first key contribution is the application of active-inference to second-person interaction. In this framework, the motor cortex is not viewed as an area that issues motor commands; rather, it is involved in issuing predictions (Adams et al., 2013; Hipólito et al., 2021). Specifically, somatomotor predictions about sensory consequences of an action are sent to the spinal cord, where they are compared with ascending proprioceptive afferents. The comparison of both ascending and descending information results in a prediction error that can be resolved by action (i.e., classical motor reflexes in the spirit of the equilibrium-point hypothesis; A. G. Feldman, 2009)—fulfilling the issued prediction of the motor cortex. Similar to ACC and AI, the motor cortex harbors large spindle-shaped neurons (Betz cells; Rivara et al., 2003) that are also suitable to convey information over long ranges. Additionally, the somatosensory cortex receives information about the sensory consequences of an action, which enables more refined predictions for future actions.

The second key contribution is the analysis of how these two core things lead to a higher demand on the evaluation and monitoring of transition probabilities in the ACC, and the fluctuating states that call for an increased attunement of internal (via the AI) and proprioceptive (via parts of the frontoparietal network) systems. The authors argue that the nested recursive structure of deep tree exploration of action drawn from the active-inference framework and the dynamic, ever-evolving fluctuation in the action opportunities within second-person contexts entail two core things: First, it leads to a higher computational demand on the evaluation and monitoring of transition probabilities, which elicits higher ACC activity. Second, it results in more environmental variability and fluctuating states, which calls for an increased attunement of internal (via the AI) and proprioceptive (via parts of the frontoparietal network) systems. Here, a second-person approach exposes interoceptive and proprioceptive bodily processes that enable and transmit social interaction.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors start by explaining the active-inference framework in the context of second-person interaction. The motor cortex is not viewed as an area that issues motor commands; rather, it is involved in issuing predictions (Adams et al., 2013; Hipólito et al., 2021). Specifically, somatomotor predictions about sensory consequences of an action are sent to the spinal cord, where they are compared with ascending proprioceptive afferents. The comparison of both ascending and descending information results in a prediction error that can be resolved by action (i.e., classical motor reflexes in the spirit of the equilibrium-point hypothesis; A. G. Feldman, 2009)—fulfilling the issued prediction of the motor cortex. Similar to ACC and AI, the motor cortex harbors large spindle-shaped neurons (Betz cells; Rivara et al., 2003) that are also suitable to convey information over long ranges. Additionally, the somatosensory cortex receives information about the sensory consequences of an action, which enables more refined predictions for future actions.

**Results/Data**

The authors do not present any results or data in this paper. The text is purely theoretical and does not contain any empirical findings.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors discuss the limitations of their work as follows: In this section, we have argued that the nested recursive structure of deep tree exploration of action (drawn from the active-inference framework) and the dynamic, ever-evolving fluctuation in the action opportunities within second-person contexts entails two core things. First, it leads to a higher computational demand on the evaluation and monitoring of transition probabilities, which elicits higher ACC activity. Second, it results in more environmental variability and fluctuating states, which calls for an increased attunement of internal (via the AI) and proprioceptive (via parts of the frontoparietal network) systems. Here, a second-person approach exposes interoceptive and proprioceptive bodily processes that enable and transmit social interaction.
