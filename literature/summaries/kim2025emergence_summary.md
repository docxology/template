**Overview/Summary**

The paper proposes a novel approach to autonomous goal-directed behavior generation in the absence of external goals and rewards. The authors argue that this is an important problem because it is not clear how an agent can form its own value function without any extrinsic or intrinsic guidance, and that many existing approaches to intrinsic motivation are heterostatic (i.e., they promote exploration until uncertainty is resolved, after which the process elicits fewer notable actions). The authors also argue that this is a fundamental question in developmental science because it is not clear where an agent's value comes from, and whether the agent can establish its own setpoints by itself. They propose the self- prior as an intrinsic preference that is autonomously formed from an agent's sensory experiences. The self-prior is defined as the internal reference values for the free energy of a system. In the active inference framework, the self-prior is used to guide the agent's actions in order to minimize its own free energy. The authors then apply this approach to a simulated infant and confirm that it can generate goal-directed behavior, specifically reaching for a target.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this paper are the introduction of the self-prior as an intrinsic preference and the demonstration of the emergence of goal-directed behaviors via active inference. The authors show that the self-prior is autonomously formed from sensory experiences in the absence of any external or internal setpoints, and that it can be used to guide the agent's actions in order to minimize its own free energy. This leads to the generation of a single goal-directed act like reaching for a target. The paper also highlights the difference between the self-prior and other approaches to intrinsic motivation, which are heterostatic (i.e., they promote exploration until uncertainty is resolved, after which the process elicits fewer notable actions). The authors argue that their approach can be used as an alternative to extrinsic or internal setpoints in order to generate goal-directed behaviors. They also propose a unified theoretical framework for both extrinsic and intrinsic motivations under the single quantitative measure of free energy.

**Methodology/Approach**

The paper is based on the active inference (AI) framework, which is a probabilistic approach that can be used to address both extrinsic and intrinsic motivations. The authors use this framework as a unified theoretical basis for understanding how an agent's actions are generated in order to minimize its own free energy. This is done by minimizing the free energy with respect to the self-prior. The self-prior is defined as the internal reference values for the free energy of a system. In the AI framework, the self-prior is used to guide the agent's actions in order to minimize its own free energy. The authors then apply this approach to a simulated infant and confirm that it can generate goal-directed behavior, specifically reaching for a target. The paper also highlights the difference between the self-prior and other approaches to intrinsic motivation, which are heterostatic (i.e., they promote exploration until uncertainty is resolved, after which the process elicits fewer notable actions). The authors argue that their approach can be used as an alternative to extrinsic or internal setpoints in order to generate goal-directed behaviors. They also propose a unified theoretical framework for both extrinsic and intrinsic motivations under the single quantitative measure of free energy.

**Results/Data**

The paper is based on the active inference (AI) framework, which is a probabilistic approach that can be used to address both extrinsic and intrinsic motivations. The authors use this framework as a unified theoretical basis for understanding how an agent's actions are generated in order to minimize its own free energy.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The main limitations of this work are the following: The authors argue that their approach can be used as an alternative to extrinsic or internal setpoints in order to generate goal-directed behaviors. They also propose a unified theoretical framework for both extrinsic and intrinsic motivations under the single quantitative measure of free energy. However, they do not discuss how their method compares with other approaches to intrinsic motivation, which are heterostatic (i.e., they promote exploration until uncertainty is resolved, after which the process elicits fewer notable actions). The authors also do not discuss how their approach can be used in more complex settings.
