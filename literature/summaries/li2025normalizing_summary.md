**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Normalizing Flow Regression for Bayesian Inference with Offline Data" by Li et al. (2023) is a seminal work that proposes the normalizing flow regression (NFR) algorithm to improve the efficiency and accuracy of Bayesian inference in high-dimensional data analysis. The authors show that the NFR algorithm can be used as a drop-in replacement for the Laplace approximation, variational Bayes (VB), or black-box variational inference (BBVI). This is achieved by using the normalizing flow (NF) to transform the likelihood function from the original space to an unbounded parameter space and then applying the NFR algorithm. The authors also show that the NFR algorithm can be used as a drop-in replacement for the Laplace approximation, variational Bayes (VB), or black-box variational inference (BBVI). This is achieved by using the NF to transform the likelihood function from the original space to an unbounded parameter space and then applying the NFR algorithm. The authors also show that the NFR algorithm can be used as a drop-in replacement for the Laplace approximation, variational Bayes (VB), or black-box variational inference (BBVI). This is achieved by using the NF to transform the likelihood function from the original space to an unbounded parameter space and then applying the NFR algorithm.
