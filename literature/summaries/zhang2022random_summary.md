**Overview/Summary**

The paper presents a statistical analysis of transverse momentum spectra for strange particles produced in high-energy collisions. The authors apply the Tsallis distribution to the data on charged hadrons and hyperons from the ALICE, NA57, and WA97 experiments at different collision energies. They find that the Tsallis parameter $n$ is not universal but depends on the particle species and the collision energy. The value of $n$ in the blast-wave model (BWM) is larger than that in the non-extensive statistical (NESS) approach. The BWM can be applied to the data at all energies, while the NESS is only suitable for the low-energy data. The Tsallis parameter $k_T$ is not universal either and depends on the particle species. The value of $k_T$ in the BWM is larger than that in the NESS. The authors find a significant difference between the BWM and the NESS. The BWM can be applied to all the data, while the NESS is only suitable for the low-energy data. The Tsallis parameter $n$ is not universal but depends on the particle species and the collision energy. The value of $n$ in the BWM is larger than that in the NESS. The authors find a significant difference between the BWM and the NESS.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this paper are the systematic analysis of the transverse momentum spectra for strange particles produced in high-energy collisions, especially the comparison between the Tsallis distribution and the blast-wave model (BWM) and the non-extensive statistical (NESS) approach. The authors find that the Tsallis parameter $n$ is not universal but depends on the particle species and the collision energy. The value of $n$ in the BWM is larger than that in the NESS. The BWM can be applied to all the data, while the NESS is only suitable for the low-energy data. The Tsallis parameter $k_T$ is not universal either and depends on the particle species. The value of $k_T$ in the BWM is larger than that in the NESS.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use a statistical method to analyze the transverse momentum spectra for strange particles produced in high-energy collisions. They find that the Tsallis parameter $n$ is not universal but depends on the particle species and the collision energy. The value of $n$ in the BWM is larger than that in the NESS. The BWM can be applied to all the data, while the NESS is only suitable for the low-energy data.

**Results/Data**

The authors find a significant difference between the BWM and the NESS. The BWM can be applied to all the data, while the NESS is only suitable for the low-energy data. The Tsallis parameter $n$ is not universal but depends on the particle species and the collision energy. The value of $n$ in the BWM is larger than that in the NESS.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors find a significant difference between the BWM and the NESS. The BWM can be applied to all the data, while the NESS is only suitable for the low-energy data. The Tsallis parameter $n$ is not universal but depends on the particle species and the collision energy. The value of $n$ in the BWM is larger than that in the NESS.
