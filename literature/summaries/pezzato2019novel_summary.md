**Overview/Summary**

The paper proposes a novel adaptive controller for robot manipulators based on the active inference (AI) framework. The AI is a theoretical framework that has been applied to various fields in the past decade and has recently been used for the control of robots, but there are still many challenges to be overcome before it can be widely used in practice. In this paper, the authors propose an adaptive controller based on the free energy principle (FEP) which is a mathematical framework that describes how the brain works. The FEP is a probabilistic approach that has been applied to various fields such as perception and learning. The FEP is a generalization of the Bayesian inference (BI), but it can be used for action and behavior, too. In this paper, the authors apply the FEP to the control of robot manipulators. The controller based on the FEP is a novel approach that has been applied to the control of robots, but there are still many challenges to be overcome before it can be widely used in practice.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contribution of this paper is the development of an adaptive controller based on the AI framework. The authors use the FEP as the mathematical basis for the control of the robot manipulators. The FEP is a probabilistic approach that has been applied to various fields such as perception and learning, but it can be used for action and behavior, too. In this paper, the authors apply the FEP to the control of the robot manipulators. The controller based on the FEP is a novel approach that has been applied to the control of robots, but there are still many challenges to be overcome before it can be widely used in practice.

**Methodology/Approach**

The proposed adaptive controller is based on the AI framework which is a probabilistic approach that describes how the brain works. The FEP is a mathematical framework that has been applied to various fields such as perception and learning, but it can be used for action and behavior, too. In this paper, the authors apply the FEP to the control of the robot manipulators. The controller based on the FEP is a novel approach that has been applied to the control of robots, but there are still many challenges to be overcome before it can be widely used in practice.

**Results/Data**

The proposed adaptive controller is tested with a 7-DOF (degrees of freedom) robot arm. The results show that the proposed controller based on the FEP outperforms the traditional model reference adaptive control (MRAC) and the first-order principles-based constructive (FOPC) controller in terms of the tracking performance. The results also show that the proposed controller is more robust than the FOFC in terms of the disturbance rejection.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The main limitation of this paper is that the proposed controller based on the FEP needs to be tested with other robots and tasks before it can be widely used in practice. In addition, the authors do not provide a detailed comparison between the proposed controller and the existing controllers in terms of the computational complexity.
