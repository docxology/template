**Overview/Summary**

The paper by Sharma et al. (2022) is a theoretical study on the dynamics of self-propelled active particles in two-dimensional space. The authors are interested in understanding the role of the run-and-tumble mechanism, which is the most basic and simplest model for the motion of microorganisms such as bacteria, that can rotate their flagella to generate a force in one direction and tumble randomly. In this paper, the authors present a general theory for the dynamics of such particles. The main finding is that the run-and-tumble active particles are able to form an ordered state with long-range order at low densities. This is in contrast to the case without the run mechanism where the long-range order can only be formed when the density is very high. The authors also present a general theory for the dynamics of the self-propelled active particles, and they find that the long-range order is possible as long as the average time between two successive tumbles is not too short. The paper provides a comprehensive analysis on the phase transition in the run-and-tumble systems.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main finding is that the run-and-tumble active particles are able to form an ordered state with long-range order at low densities, which is in contrast to the case without the run mechanism where the long-range order can only be formed when the density is very high. The authors also present a general theory for the dynamics of the self-propelled active particles, and they find that the long-range order is possible as long as the average time between two successive tumbles is not too short. The paper provides a comprehensive analysis on the phase transition in the run-and-tumble systems.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors first present a general theory for the dynamics of the self-propelled active particles, and they find that the long-range order is possible as long as the average time between two successive tumbles is not too short. The authors also study the phase transition in the run-and-tumble systems.

**Results/Data**

The authors use numerical simulations to study the phase transition in the run-and-tumble systems. The results show that the ordered state with long-range order can be formed at low densities, which is in contrast to the case without the run mechanism where the long-range order can only be formed when the density is very high.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors also discuss the limitations of their theory and future work. The authors find that the general theory for the self-propelled active particles is not applicable at the low densities, because the time between two successive tumbles is too short in this case. The authors suggest that the long-range order can be formed when the run-and-tumble mechanism is included.

**Additional Information**

The authors also provide a comprehensive analysis on the phase transition in the run-and-tumble systems, and they find that the long-range order is possible as long as the average time between two successive tumbles is not too short. The paper provides a general theory for the dynamics of the self-propelled active particles, and it is applicable at high densities.
