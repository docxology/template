**Overview/Summary**

A Variational Inference based Detection Method for Repetition Modulation (RepM) is a new spatial modulation technique that can be used to increase the data rate of a Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) system. The authors propose a novel detection method for this technique, which is based on the variational inference principle and uses the reparameterization trick in the Variational Autoencoder (VAE). In the proposed method, the authors first introduce the RepM scheme, where the information bits are represented by the repetition of the same symbol. The number of repetitions is determined according to the channel condition. Then, a novel detection method based on the VAE is presented for this technique. The proposed method can be used in the scenarios with the high spatial multiplexing gain and the low spatial multiplexing gain. In addition, the authors also compare the performance of the proposed method with the existing methods.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The key contributions of the paper are the introduction of the RepM scheme and the detection method based on the VAE. The main findings of the paper are that the proposed method can be used in both scenarios with high spatial multiplexing gain and low spatial multiplexing gain, and it outperforms the existing methods.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The limitations of the paper are that the authors only compare the performance of the proposed method with the existing methods. The authors do not discuss the potential future work or the possible applications of the proposed method. The authors also do not mention the complexity of the proposed method, which is a limitation of this paper.
