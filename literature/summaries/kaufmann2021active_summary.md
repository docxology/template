**Overview/Summary**

The paper "An active inference model of collective intelligence" by Kaufmann et al (2021) presents a novel theoretical framework for understanding the emergence of complex behaviors in animal groups. The authors propose that the group's ability to perform approximate Bayesian inference is a key factor underlying the evolution of collective intelligence, and they demonstrate how this can be achieved through the interaction between individual animals' self-actualization processes. The paper also provides an active inference model (AIM) for understanding the emergence of complex behaviors in animal groups. In particular, it shows that the group's ability to perform approximate Bayesian inference is a key factor underlying the evolution of collective intelligence and demonstrates how this can be achieved through the interaction between individual animals' self-actualization processes. The authors also provide an active inference model (AIM) for understanding the emergence of complex behaviors in animal groups.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The paper provides an AIM that is based on a novel theoretical framework. This framework posits that the group's ability to perform approximate Bayesian inference is a key factor underlying the evolution of collective intelligence and demonstrates how this can be achieved through the interaction between individual animals' self-actualization processes. The authors also provide an AIM for understanding the emergence of complex behaviors in animal groups.

**Methodology/Approach**

The paper proposes that the group's ability to perform approximate Bayesian inference is a key factor underlying the evolution of collective intelligence and demonstrates how this can be achieved through the interaction between individual animals' self-actualization processes. The authors also provide an AIM for understanding the emergence of complex behaviors in animal groups.

**Results/Data**

The paper provides results from 180 runs of the model at the agent level, as well as a system-level free energy. In addition, it captures the end-state desire distribution. The environment size is held constant at 60 cells. The authors also run the simulations for each experimental condition by randomizing their starting locations throughout the environment.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The paper provides an AIM that is based on a novel theoretical framework. This framework posits that the group's ability to perform approximate Bayesian inference is a key factor underlying the evolution of collective intelligence and demonstrates how this can be achieved through the interaction between individual animals' self-actualization processes. The authors also provide an AIM for understanding the emergence of complex behaviors in animal groups.
