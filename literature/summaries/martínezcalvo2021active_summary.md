**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Active transport in complex environments" by Alejandro Martín-Rodríguez et al. is a comprehensive review of the current state of the field of active transport in complex environments. The authors discuss the main challenges that need to be overcome when studying the behavior of self-propelled particles, such as bacteria and micro-organisms, in complex environments, which are characterized by spatial heterogeneities in the chemical concentration. These heterogeneities can arise from a variety of sources including the presence of boundaries, the geometry of the environment, and the interactions between the particles themselves. The authors identify the main challenges that need to be overcome when studying the behavior of self-propelled particles in complex environments, which are characterized by spatial heterogeneities in the chemical concentration. These heterogeneities can arise from a variety of sources including the presence of boundaries, the geometry of the environment, and the interactions between the particles themselves.
