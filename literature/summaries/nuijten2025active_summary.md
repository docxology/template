**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Active Inference is a Subtype of Variational Bayes" by [Authors] (Year) is an important contribution to the field of probabilistic modeling and inference. The authors present a novel perspective on active inference, which has been used in various forms for over 30 years, but without a clear theoretical understanding of its relationship with other inference methods. This paper establishes that active inference is a sub-type of variational Bayes (VB), which is a family of approximate Bayesian inference algorithms. The authors' main contributions are the following.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The first contribution is to provide a clear and concise definition of active inference. The second contribution is to show that active inference is a special case of VB, and the third is to demonstrate the relationship between active inference and other approximate Bayesian inference algorithms. This paper also provides some examples of how active inference can be used in different applications.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors begin by providing an overview of the literature on variational Bayes (VB) methods for approximate Bayesian inference, which are a family of methods that use the Kullback-Leibler divergence to approximate the true posterior. The first part of this paper is to provide a clear and concise definition of active inference. They then show that active inference is a special case of VB. Finally, they demonstrate the relationship between active inference and other approximate Bayesian inference algorithms.

**Results/Data**

The main results are as follows. First, the authors define active inference and show that it is a sub-type of variational Bayes (VB). Second, they provide some examples of how active inference can be used in different applications.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The paper does not discuss any limitations or future work.
