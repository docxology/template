**Overview/Summary**
The paper "Incorporating (Variational) Free Energy Models" is a philosophical analysis of the predictive processing (PP) framework in cognitive science. The author argues that if PP is to be understood as a mechanistic theory, then it should also include the energetic dimension of its generative models. This would mean that the free energy minimization process in the variational free energy (VFE) and the variational information maximization processes in the neural evidence sandwich (NESS) are constitutive components of the predictive mechanisms. The author defends this claim by providing a philosophical analysis of the PP framework, which is based on the heuristics of constraint-based mechanisms. This approach requires that the mechanistic explanations of the phenomena should be based on the organization of constraints and the energy dimension of the generative models. These two components are constitutive for autonomous systems to maintain their autonomy by generating certain predictions. The paper also provides a brief overview of the FEP and NESS mathematics, which seem to support this claim.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The author's main point is that if PP is to be understood as a mechanistic theory, then it should also include the energetic dimension of its generative models. This would mean that the free energy minimization process in the VFE and the variational information maximization processes in the NESS are constitutive components of the predictive mechanisms. The author defends this claim by providing a philosophical analysis of the PP framework, which is based on the heuristics of constraint-based mechanisms. This approach requires that the mechanistic explanations of the phenomena should be based on the organization of constraints and the energy dimension of the generative models. These two components are constitutive for autonomous systems to maintain their autonomy by generating certain predictions.

**Methodology/Approach**
The paper is a philosophical analysis, so there is no methodology or approach section. The author provides a brief overview of the FEP and NESS mathematics, which seem to support this claim. There is also some discussion of the PP framework and its heuristics. This is not an empirical study, but rather a theoretical analysis of the PP framework.

**Results/Data**
The paper does not contain any results or data section. It only contains a brief overview of the FEP and NESS mathematics that seem to support this claim. There are also some references to the literature on the PP framework.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The author's main point is that if PP is to be understood as a mechanistic theory, then it should also include the energetic dimension of its generative models. This would mean that the free energy minimization process in the VFE and the variational information maximization processes in the NESS are constitutive components of the predictive mechanisms. The author defends this claim by providing a philosophical analysis of the PP framework, which is based on the heuristics of constraint-based mechanisms. This approach requires that the mechanistic explanations of the phenomena should be based on the organization of constraints and the energy dimension of the generative models.
