**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Active Inference for Autonomous Decision-Making with Context" is a research article in the field of robotics that proposes an active inference framework for autonomous decision-making in partially observable stochastic domains. The authors focus on the problem of making decisions when the environment is partially observable and the agent does not have access to all relevant information, which is a common situation in many real-world applications. They argue that this problem can be addressed by using the free energy principle as an objective function for learning the policy. The paper also discusses the challenges of applying the active inference framework in the context of robotics.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors first discuss the importance of autonomous decision-making in partially observable stochastic domains, where the agent does not have access to all relevant information. They then present a generalization of the free energy principle that can be used as an objective function for learning the policy. The active inference framework is based on the idea that the agent should make decisions so that it minimizes its expected future surprise or uncertainty. In this paper, they use the concept of "prior preference" to describe how the agent's prior beliefs are updated by the environment and the agent's actions. They also discuss the challenges of applying the active inference framework in the context of robotics.
