**Overview/Summary**

The paper is a conference summary of a talk on active galactic nuclei (AGN) and their host galaxies. The speaker discusses the main results from the conference, which include the central engine of AGN, the evolution of black holes, and the co-evolution of supermassive black holes with the surrounding galaxy. 

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The first part of the paper is about the central engine of AGN, including the discussion on the role of the supermassive black hole in the host galaxy. The speaker also talks about the evolution of the black hole and its co-evolution with the host galaxy. In particular, the speaker discusses the following topics: (1) the mass of the black hole; (2) the accretion rate of the black hole; (3) the spin of the black hole; (4) the luminosity of the AGN; (5) the size of the black hole; and (6) the time scale for the growth of the supermassive black hole. The speaker also discusses some other topics, such as the origin of the mass of the central engine, the role of the supermassive black hole in the host galaxy, and the evolution of the black hole. 

**Methodology/Approach**

The conference was held to discuss the main results from the conference, which include the discussion on the central engine of AGN, the evolution of black holes, and the co-evolution of supermassive black holes with the surrounding galaxy. The speaker discusses some other topics, such as the origin of the mass of the central engine, the role of the supermassive black hole in the host galaxy, and the evolution of the black hole. 

**Results/Data**

The main results from the conference include: (1) the mass of the black hole; (2) the accretion rate of the black hole; (3) the spin of the black hole; (4) the luminosity of the AGN; and (5) the size of the black hole. The speaker also discusses some other topics, such as the origin of the mass of the central engine, the role of the supermassive black hole in the host galaxy, and the evolution of the black hole. 

**Limitations/Discussion**

The main weakness of this paper is that it only provides a summary of the conference without any new results or contributions from the author. The other weaknesses are: (1) the lack of details on the methodology; (2) the lack of details on the data used in the conference; and (3) the lack of discussion on the future work.
