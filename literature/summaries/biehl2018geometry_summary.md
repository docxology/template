**Overview/Summary**

The present paper is a theoretical contribution to the field of active inference (AI), which is an approach to understanding how we make decisions about the world and how our brains work. The authors provide a mathematical description of the process, using the language of differential geometry. In particular, they describe the space of all possible states that can occur in a given situation, and the dynamics of this space. This allows them to discuss what is meant by "optimal" in the context of AI, and how the optimal state evolves over time.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contribution of the paper is the development of the mathematical framework for describing the process of active inference. The authors show that the process can be described as a gradient flow on the space of all possible states, where the gradient is given by the "free energy". This is a function that depends on the current state and also on the future state. The free energy is not just a function of the current state, but it also depends on what will happen in the future. The authors show that this process can be described as a gradient flow on the space of all possible states. They use the language of differential geometry to describe the space of all possible states and the dynamics of this space, which is given by the "free energy". This allows them to discuss what is meant by "optimal" in the context of AI, and how the optimal state evolves over time.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use the language of differential geometry. The key mathematical concepts are the gradient flow and the free energy function. They also provide a number of examples that illustrate the process of active inference, including a simple example with a single neuron and an example in which there is a large number of neurons. In these cases the optimal state can be found by finding the minimum of the free energy.

The authors also provide a number of examples that illustrate the process of active inference, including a simple example with a single neuron and an example in which there is a large number of neurons. In these cases the optimal state can be found by finding the minimum of the free energy.
