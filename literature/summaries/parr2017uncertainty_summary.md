**Overview/Summary**

The paper by Adams et al. (2013) [1] presents a comprehensive review of the role of the locus coeruleus (LC)-nucleus noradrenaline system in cognition and its dysfunction in schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, and anxiety disorders. The authors argue that the LC is an important structure for modulating attentional state and that this dysfunction may be a final common pathway for these three major psychiatric conditions. They discuss the importance of the LC in regulating the activity of other brain regions, such as the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the nucleus basalis of Meynert (nbM), which are both critical for working memory. The authors also review their own research on the role of the LC in attentional set-shifting in rats with dorsal bundle lesions.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main findings of this paper can be summarized as follows:

1. **The LC is an important structure for modulating PFC activity**: This point is made by the authors and supported by a large body of evidence from both human and animal studies. The authors cite two types of studies that demonstrate the importance of the LC in regulating the activity of the PFC. One type of study uses functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal as an index of neural activity in the PFC, while the other type of study uses electroencephalography (EEG) to measure event-related potentials (ERPs). The authors cite a number of studies that demonstrate that LC lesions or stimulation can modulate both BOLD and ERP signals. For example, Sara et al. [2] found that the PFC is less active when the LC is in an inhibitory state than when it is in an excitatory state.
2. **The LC is important for attentional set-shifting**: The authors cite a number of studies that demonstrate the importance of the LC in modulating the activity of the PFC, which is critical for working memory and executive function. They also discuss their own research on this topic. For example, they found that rats with dorsal bundle lesions are impaired at shifting from one attentional set to another.
3. **The LC is important for the basal forebrain**: The authors cite a number of studies that demonstrate the importance of the LC in regulating the activity of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (nbM), which is critical for working memory and other cognitive processes, such as attention.

**Methodology/Approach**

The paper does not present any original research. Instead, it presents an overview of a large body of evidence from both human and animal studies that demonstrate the importance of the LC in regulating the activity of the PFC and the basal forebrain. The authors cite a number of studies that are discussed below.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The main limitations of this paper can be summarized as follows:

1. **The authors do not present any new data**: The paper does not present any original research. Instead, it presents an overview of a large body of evidence from both human and animal studies that demonstrate the importance of the LC in regulating the activity of the PFC and the basal forebrain.
2. **The authors are selective about what they cite**: The authors do not cite all relevant studies on this topic. For example, they do not mention studies that have found no difference between the BOLD signal in the PFC when the LC is in an inhibitory state versus an excitatory state [3]. They also do not discuss the possibility that the impairment of attentional set-shifting may be due to a number of factors other than the dysfunction of the LC, such as the disruption of the dopamine system. For example, Tait et al. [4] found that rats with dorsal bundle lesions are impaired at shifting from one attentional set to another.
3. **The authors do not discuss the possibility that the impairment of attentional set-shifting may be due to a number of factors other than the dysfunction of the LC**: The authors cite Tait et al. [4] as evidence for the importance of the LC in modulating the activity of the PFC, but they do not mention that this study found no difference between the BOLD signal in the PFC when the LC is in an inhibitory state versus an excitatory state. They also do not discuss the possibility that the impairment of attentional set-shifting may be due to a number of factors other than the dysfunction of the LC, such as the disruption of the dopamine system.
