**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Active Probabilistic Inference on Matrices for Pre-Conditioning in Stochastic Optimization" by A.Wills and T.Schön (2018) introduces a new approach to the stochastic quasi-Newton method, which is a popular optimization algorithm. The authors show that the standard stochastic quasi-Newton method can be improved by using an active set strategy to select the subset of the Hessian matrix on which to perform the line search. This active set strategy is based on the idea of the active set in the Newton method and it can be used for both exact and inexact line searches. The authors also show that the proposed stochastic quasi-Newton method can be extended to handle large-scale problems by using a limited-memory version of the algorithm.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of an active set strategy into the standard stochastic quasi-Newton method. This new approach can be used for both exact and inexact line searches, which means that it can be applied to different types of problems. The authors also show that the proposed algorithm can handle large-scale problems by using a limited-memory version of the algorithm. In addition, the paper provides an empirical comparison between the standard stochastic quasi-Newton method and the proposed algorithm.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors first introduce the standard stochastic quasi-Newton method. This is a popular optimization algorithm that uses a Hessian approximation to approximate the true Hessian matrix. The authors then show how the active set strategy can be used in the stochastic quasi-Newton method. Finally, the authors compare the proposed algorithm with the standard one.

**Results/Data**

The paper shows two results. The first result is the introduction of an active set strategy into the standard stochastic quasi-Newton method. The second result is that the proposed algorithm can handle large-scale problems by using a limited-memory version of the algorithm. These two results are supported by numerical experiments. The authors also compare the proposed algorithm with the standard one.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The paper does not discuss any limitations or future work.
