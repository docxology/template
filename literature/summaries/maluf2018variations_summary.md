**Overview/Summary**

The paper is about the study of the energy and angular momentum of free particles in the background of plane-fronted gravitational waves (pp-waves) with gyratons. The authors consider a class of pp-wave spacetimes that are not necessarily asymptotically flat at infinity, but have a finite region where the metric is conformally flat. In this case, the energy and angular momentum of free particles in the vicinity of the source can be different from those in the Minkowski background. The paper also discusses the memory effect for these pp-waves with gyratons.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main results are the following:

- The authors first discuss the energy and angular momentum of a free particle in the Minkowski background, which is well known to be 1/3 of its rest mass. They then consider the case where the pp-wave has a finite region where the metric is conformally flat (the "sandwich" case). In this case, the energy and angular momentum of the free particles can differ from those in the Minkowski background. The authors also discuss the memory effect for the sandwich pp-waves with gyratons.

- They show that the energy and angular momentum of a free particle in the sandwich pp-wave are 1/3 of its rest mass if the region where the metric is conformally flat is not too close to the source, but can be different from those in the Minkowski background if this region is very close to the source. The authors also discuss the memory effect for these pp-waves with gyratons.
