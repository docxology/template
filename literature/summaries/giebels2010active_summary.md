**Overview/Summary**

The paper presents a comprehensive review of the current state of knowledge about active galactic nuclei (AGN) and their high-energy emission in gamma rays by the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope (Fermi). The main focus is on the first year of data from the Large Area Telescope (LAT), which has been operational since 2008. The authors discuss the characteristics of the AGN population, the detection of the extragalactic diffuse background, and the properties of individual sources. They also highlight the prospects for the future.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The first year of data from the LAT is characterized by a large number of new gamma-ray detections in the sky, including 45 active galactic nuclei (AGN), which are the most powerful objects in the universe. The authors discuss the characteristics of this population and the detection of the extragalactic diffuse background. They also highlight the properties of individual sources.

**Methodology/Approach**

The paper is organized to provide a comprehensive review of the first year of data from the LAT, with an emphasis on the AGN population. The authors use the first-year catalog (Abdo et al., 2010) as their primary source of information and also discuss other relevant papers.
