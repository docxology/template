**Overview/Summary**

The authors of this paper investigate how the choice of a Gaussian process (GP) model can impact the inferred properties of giant exoplanets. The GP is a flexible and non-parametric statistical framework that has become increasingly popular in the field of exoplanetary science, particularly for characterizing the uncertainties of the physical parameters of the host star. This work is motivated by the fact that the choice of a GP model can have a significant impact on the inferred properties of the giant planet. The authors use a combination of simulations and real data to show how different GP models can be used in the same way, but with different results. The paper is well-organized and easy to follow, so I will not summarize it here.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main finding of this work is that the choice of the GP model can have a significant impact on the inferred properties of the giant planet. In particular, the authors show that the use of a "power-function" (PF) GP, which is the most common method in the field, gives different results than the use of a "lognormal" (LN) or "inverse-Gaussian" (IG) GP. The PF model assumes that the log of the host star's effective temperature follows a power function with two parameters: the mean and the exponent. The LN and IG models assume that the logarithm of the host star's effective temperature is normally distributed, or inversely Gaussianly distributed, respectively. The authors show that the use of the PF model can result in a biased estimate of the giant planet's mass. They also find that the use of the PF model results in a larger scatter in the inferred mass than the use of the LN and IG models. This is because the use of the PF model gives more weight to the data points with the largest uncertainties, which are typically those at the longest wavelengths. The authors show that the use of the PF model can result in an overestimation of the giant planet's mass by up to 50% and a larger scatter than the use of the LN or IG models.

**Methodology/Approach**

The approach used here is based on the use of a combination of simulations and real data. The authors first describe the different GP models that are commonly used in the field, including the PF model. They then discuss how these GPs can be used to obtain the physical parameters of the host star. The authors also describe the method for using the GPs to estimate the uncertainties of the host star's temperature. The authors use a combination of real and simulated data from the Kepler mission to show the impact that the choice of the GP model has on the inferred properties of the giant planet.

The main finding of this work is that the choice of the GP model can have a significant impact on the inferred properties of the giant planet. The authors find that the use of the PF model results in an overestimation of the giant planet's mass by up to 50% and a larger scatter than the use of the LN or IG models.

The authors discuss the impact this has on the inferred physical parameters of the host star. The authors suggest that the choice of the GP model should be considered when interpreting the results from a given analysis.
