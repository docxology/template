**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Active Neural Mapping" by Zike Yan et al. [1] proposes a novel framework for active neural mapping (ANM) that leverages the uncertainty of the neural representation to guide the planning process, which is particularly useful in the context of 3D reconstruction and exploration tasks where the goal is to reconstruct an accurate map of the environment while minimizing the number of observations needed. The proposed method uses a probabilistic representation of the scene as a neural signed distance field (NeRF) that can be used for both planning and perception, and it has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results in several 3D reconstruction benchmarks. In 

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The key contribution of the paper is a novel method that uses the uncertainty of the neural representation to guide the planning process for active exploration. The authors have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach in several 3D reconstruction benchmarks. In particular, they show that the proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art results on the ScanNet and Matterport3D datasets.

**Methodology/Approach**

The proposed ANM framework is based on a probabilistic representation of the scene as a neural signed distance field (NeRF) that can be used for both planning and perception. The authors first propose an initial NeRF by training it with a set of 2D images, which is then refined in an online manner using the observations from the environment. In the refinement process, the uncertainty of the NeRF is estimated based on the variance of the predictions over the mini-batch size. The authors use this variance to guide the planning process and select the next best view that can be used for the refinement. This process is repeated until a stopping criterion is met.

**Results/Data**

The proposed ANM framework has been demonstrated in several 3D reconstruction benchmarks, including ScanNet and Matterport3D. In these experiments, the authors have shown that the proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art results.

**Limitations/Discussion**

One of the limitations of the paper is that it only uses a single type of observation (i.e., RGB images) for the refinement process. The authors do not discuss how to handle other types of observations, such as depth or semantic segmentation maps, in the online refinement process. Another limitation is that the proposed method does not consider the uncertainty of the initial NeRF and it only considers the variance of the predictions over the mini-batch size during the refinement. In the future work, the authors can discuss how to handle these issues.
