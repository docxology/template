**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Holomorphic representation of quantum computations" by U. Kretzschmer and M. Walter presents a new perspective on the theory of quantum computation, which is based on the mathematical structure of the Segal-Bargmann space. The authors show that this space can be used to represent any quantum evolution as a holomorphic function over Cm, where m is the number of modes in the system. This allows for a unified description of both continuous and discrete measurements. The paper also discusses how the different types of measurements correspond to the wave-particle duality in quantum mechanics. In particular, the authors show that the first type of measurement corresponds to the homodyne detection while the second one is related to the particle-number measurement. Moreover, the relation between the two types of measurements can be viewed as an instance of the concept of wave-particle duality.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contribution of the paper is a new representation for quantum computations in terms of holomorphic functions on the Segal-Bargmann space. The authors show that any quantum evolution, including both continuous and discrete measurements, can be described by a sequence of self-adjoint di erential operators acting on this space. This allows to unify the different types of measurements. The paper also discusses how the different types of measurements correspond to the wave-particle duality in quantum mechanics.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use the mathematical structure of the Segal-Bargmann space, which is a complex Hilbert space that consists of all holomorphic functions on Cm with the Gaussian measure. The paper also uses the theory of self-adjoint di erential operators and their spectral representations. The authors also discuss the relation between the different types of measurements and the wave-particle duality in quantum mechanics.

**Results/Data**

The main results of the paper are a new representation for quantum computations, which is based on the mathematical structure of the Segal-Bargmann space. The authors show that any quantum evolution can be described by a sequence of self-adjoint di erential operators acting on this space. This allows to unify the different types of measurements. The paper also discusses how the different types of measurements correspond to the wave-particle duality in quantum mechanics.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors do not discuss any limitations or future work in the paper. They only mention that the new representation is a new perspective on the theory of quantum computation, which may be useful for further research.
