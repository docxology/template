**Overview/Summary**
The paper presents a new algorithm called Branching Time Active Inference (BTAI), which is an extension of the original active inference (AI) framework by K.J.Friston and his collaborators. The authors argue that AI can be used for planning in sequential decision-making problems, such as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). They propose a new algorithm called BTAI, which is based on the theory of sophisticated inference (SI), another extension of the original AI framework by K.J.Friston and his collaborators. The authors also present an empirical study that compares the performance of BTAI with other approaches in MDPs.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The main contributions of this paper are:
1. **BTAI**: A new algorithm for planning in sequential decision-making problems, which is based on the theory of SI.
2. **Empirical comparison**: The authors compare the performance of BTAI with other approaches in MDPs.

**Methodology/Approach**
The original AI framework (Friston et al., 2021) is a generalization of the free energy principle, which is a variational principle for approximating the posterior distribution. In this paper, the authors present an empirical study that compares BTAI with other approaches in MCTS.

**Results/Data**
The performance of BTAI and other approaches are compared empirically in 5 different MDPs. The results show that BTAI outperforms all the baselines in these 5 MDPs.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The authors also present some limitations and future work for this paper. For example, they suggest that it might be interesting to compare the performance of gpcost
I
,
gfeef
I and gclassic
I empirically and theoretically in future research.
