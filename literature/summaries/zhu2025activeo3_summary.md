**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Active- O3: Empowering Multimodal Multitask Learning" proposes a novel multimodal learning framework that can be used for various tasks such as object detection and segmentation in images. The proposed Active-O3 (AO3) is an active learning approach which allows the user to select where to focus on the image, rather than letting the machine select what it thinks is most important. This is achieved by providing a set of multimodal modalities that can be used to query the model about the image. The AO3 framework is based on the idea that if the user has some knowledge about the scene in which the images are taken (e.g., they have been annotated with objects), then the machine should use this information to decide what it thinks is most important, rather than trying to learn everything from scratch. This is achieved by providing a set of multimodal modalities that can be used to query the model about the image. The AO3 framework is based on the idea that if the user has some knowledge about the scene in which the images are taken (e.g., they have been annotated with objects), then the machine should use this information to decide what it thinks is most important, rather than trying to learn everything from scratch.
