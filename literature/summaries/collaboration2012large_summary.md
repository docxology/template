**Summary**

The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) is a next-generation astronomical facility designed to survey the entire sky in six filters from 0.2 to 1.1 μm. The LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) is an organization of scientists and engineers that will develop a high-level plan for the study of dark energy with the LSST data. The DESC will cover all the key aspects of a long-term plan to tackle the nature of dark energy with the LSST, including the development and optimization of a complete set of dark energy analyses that will be performed with the data, the detailed study of systematic issues that may compromise those analyses, the clariﬁcation of the sensitivity of those analyses to various technical aspects of the LSST system design, the generation and reﬁnement of simulations and other tools required to validate the analyses, and the identiﬁcation and assembly of the computational resources to support such investigations both before and after the onset of data taking. The DESC is an organization that will cover all the key aspects of a long-term plan to tackle the nature of dark energy with the LSST.

**Overview/Summary**
