**Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST): Dark Energy Science Collaboration**

**Overview/Summary**
The LSST is a next-generation astronomical survey designed to study the universe on large scales, with a primary focus on understanding dark energy. The LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) aims to develop a comprehensive plan for studying dark energy using LSST data.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The DESC will address various aspects of dark energy research, including:

1. **Dark Energy Analyses**: Develop and optimize a range of dark energy analyses, such as weak lensing, supernovae, large-scale structure, and strong lensing.
2. **Systematic Uncertainties**: Identify, quantify, and minimize potential systematic uncertainties that could impact the accuracy of the dark energy results.
3. **Computational Framework**: Establish an efficient computational framework for performing the necessary calculations and simulations.

**Methodology/Approach**
The DESC will follow a collaborative approach to develop a high-level plan for studying dark energy with LSST data. This includes:

1. **Initial Kick-Off Meeting**: Held at the University of Pennsylvania in mid-June 2012, where over 175 scientists from 49 institutions joined the Collaboration.
2. **Collaborative Research**: The DESC will conduct collaborative research to develop and optimize the dark energy analyses, study systematic uncertainties, and establish a computational framework.

**Results/Data**
The LSST will provide a vast amount of data on large scales, enabling the study of various astrophysical phenomena, including:

1. **Weak Lensing**: Measure the distortion of galaxy shapes due to gravitational lensing.
2. **Supernovae**: Study type Ia supernovae and their properties to constrain dark energy models.
3. **Large-Scale Structure/Baryon Oscillations**: Analyze the distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters on large scales.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The DESC will also address potential limitations and challenges in studying dark energy with LSST data, including:

1. **Systematic Uncertainties**: Minimize systematic uncertainties that could impact the accuracy of the results.
2. **Computational Resources**: Ensure sufficient computational resources to support the research.

**Conclusion**
The LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration aims to develop a comprehensive plan for studying dark energy using LSST data, addressing various aspects of dark energy research and minimizing potential systematic uncertainties.
