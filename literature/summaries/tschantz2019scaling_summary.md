**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Scaling Active Inference" by Alexander Tschantz is a work in progress. The main goal of this paper is to scale up the active inference (AI) framework for large-scale problems. The authors first give an overview of the current state-of-the-art AI and its limitations, then describe the proposed method and the results.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The key contributions are the proposed method that can be used to scale up the AI framework for large-scale problems. The main findings are the experimental results on the proposed method.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors first give a brief overview of the current state-of-the-art AI and its limitations, then describe the proposed method. The proposed method is based on the idea that the inference process can be decomposed into two parts: the generative model and the likelihood function. The generative model is used to generate samples from the posterior distribution over the latent variables. The likelihood function is used to compute the probability of the observed data given the latent variables.
