**Overview/Summary**
This paper introduces a new technique for causal inference with unconfoundedness in the presence of confounders. The authors propose an inflation approach to derive necessary conditions that a distribution must satisfy to be compatible with a given causal structure, and use it to witness the incompatibility of a target distribution with the given causal structure. They also provide a new method for deriving causal compatibility inequalities.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The main contributions of this paper are the introduction of the inflation technique and its application to derive necessary conditions that a distribution must satisfy to be compatible with a given causal structure, as well as the derivation of causal compatibility inequalities by the inﬂation technique. The authors show that the inﬂation approach can be used not only to witness the incompatibility of a given distribution with a given causal structure but also to derive necessary conditions that a distribution must satisfy to be compatible with the given causal structure.

**Methodology/Approach**
The paper is organized as follows: First, it introduces the inflation technique and its application to derive necessary conditions that a distribution must satisfy to be compatible with a given causal structure. Then, it shows that the inﬂation approach can be used not only to witness the incompatibility of a given distribution with a given causal structure but also to derive necessary conditions that a distribution must satisfy to be compatible with the given causal structure.

**Results/Data**
The authors show that the inﬂation approach can be used not only to witness the incompatibility of a given distribution with a given causal structure but also to derive necessary conditions that a distribution must satisfy to be compatible with the given causal structure. The authors propose an inflation approach to derive necessary conditions that a distribution must satisfy to be compatible with a given causal structure, and use it to witness the incompatibility of a target distribution with the given causal structure. They also provide a new method for deriving causal compatibility inequalities by the inﬂation technique via Corollary 6.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The authors conclude that the inﬂation approach can be used not only to witness the incompatibility of a given distribution with a given causal structure but also to derive necessary conditions that a distribution must satisfy to be compatible with the given causal structure. The authors show that the inﬂation approach can be used not only to witness the incompatibility of a given distribution with a given causal structure but also to derive necessary conditions that a distribution must satisfy to be compatible with the given causal structure.
