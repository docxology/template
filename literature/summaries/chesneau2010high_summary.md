**Overview/Summary**

The paper presents a study on the high spatial resolution monitoring of the activity of BA supergiants (BAsg) in the Hertzsprung Gap (HG). The authors use the Vosges I telescope and the AMESU spectrometer to measure the Balmer lines, HeI 1080 Å, and Paβ line in the J band. They also use the FLUOR/CHARA2 interferometer to obtain the spatially resolved spectroscopy of the Hα and HeI 1080 Å lines in the J band. The main goal is to study the activity of BAsgs with a high spatial resolution, which can be used to understand the evolution of these stars. The authors find that the Balmer lines are formed at the base of the wind and the HeI 1080 Å line is formed in the extended atmosphere.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main finding is that the activity of BAsgs with a high spatial resolution can be monitored by the Vosges I telescope. The authors find that the Balmer lines are formed at the base of the wind and the HeI 1080 Å line is formed in the extended atmosphere. They also find that the Hα and HeI 1080 Å lines have different profiles, which indicates that the formation region of the two lines are different. The authors suggest that the activity of BAsgs can be monitored by the Vosges I telescope with a high spatial resolution.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use the Vosges I telescope and the AMESU spectrometer to measure the Balmer lines, HeI 1080 Å, and Paβ line in the J band. The authors also use the FLUOR/CHARA2 interferometer to obtain the spatially resolved spectroscopy of the Hα and HeI 1080 Å lines in the J band. They find that the Balmer lines are formed at the base of the wind and the HeI 1080 Å line is formed in the extended atmosphere.

**Results/Data**

The authors measure the equivalent widths (EWs) of the Balmer lines, HeI 1080 Å, and Paβ line in the J band. The EWs of the Hα and HeI 1080 Å lines are different for the two stars. The authors find that the activity of BAsgs with a high spatial resolution can be monitored by the Vosges I telescope. They also find that the Balmer lines, which are formed at the base of the wind, have different profiles from the Hα and HeI 1080 Å lines.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors suggest that the activity of BAsgs with a high spatial resolution can be monitored by the Vosges I telescope. They also find that the Balmer lines are formed at the base of the wind, which is different from the Hα and HeI 1080 Å lines. The authors do not discuss any limitations or future work in this paper.
