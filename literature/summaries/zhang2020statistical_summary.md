**Overview/Summary**

The paper proposes a statistical inference approach for community detection in networks with a given assortativity structure. The authors first formulate a generative model that is based on the stochastic blockmodel (SBM) and consider the problem of testing whether the observed network is generated from this model. This is a classical statistical inference problem, which can be solved by using the likelihood ratio test (LRT). In order to apply the LRT, the authors first need to derive the distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis that the observed network is not generated from the SBM. The main challenge here is that the number of possible community structures in a given graph can be very large and thus it is difficult to calculate the exact distribution of the test statistic. In this paper, the authors propose an approximate method for calculating the distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis. This is done by using the fact that the SBM can be viewed as a mixture of the stochastic blockmodel with a given number of communities (SBMC) and the stochastic blockmodel with all possible community structures (SBMAC). The authors also propose an efficient algorithm for calculating the distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis. In addition, the authors show that the proposed method is consistent in the sense that it can be used to detect the true community structure if the observed network is generated from the SBM with a given number of communities. 

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, the authors propose an approximate method for calculating the distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis that the observed network is not generated from the SBM. This is done by using the fact that the SBM can be viewed as a mixture of the stochastic blockmodel with a given number of communities (SBMC) and the stochastic blockmodel with all possible community structures (SBMAC). The authors also propose an efficient algorithm for calculating the distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis. Second, the authors show that the proposed method is consistent in the sense that it can be used to detect the true community structure if the observed network is generated from the SBM with a given number of communities. 

**Methodology/Approach**

The first step for the LRT is to derive the distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis that the observed network is not generated from the SBM. This is done by using the fact that the SBM can be viewed as a mixture of the stochastic blockmodel with a given number of communities (SBMC) and the stochastic blockmodel with all possible community structures (SBMAC). The authors also propose an efficient algorithm for calculating the distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis. 

**Results/Data**

The results of this paper are two-fold. First, the authors show that the proposed method is consistent in the sense that it can be used to detect the true community structure if the observed network is generated from the SBM with a given number of communities. Second, the authors provide an empirical study for the LRT and the proposed approximate method. The results of this paper are two-fold. 

**Limitations/Discussion**

The main limitation of this paper is that it only considers the case where the observed network is generated from the SBM with a given number of communities. In other words, the authors do not consider the case where the true community structure is unknown. The authors also provide an empirical study for the LRT and the proposed approximate method.
