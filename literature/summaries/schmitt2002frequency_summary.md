**Overview/Summary**

The paper "The Frequency of Active and Quiescent Galaxies with Companions" by Henrique R. Schmitt (2002) is a study on the percentage of active, HII, and quiescent galaxies that have companions in the Palomar survey. The author aims to address the question of how many active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are fed by their host galaxy. The primary concern is the mechanism responsible for making gas lose angular momentum and move from galactic scales down to the inner 1 pc region, with several mechanisms suggested to explain this process such as interactions or bars. A comparison between AGNs and normal galaxies requires that the samples be selected by a matching host galaxy property. The Palomar sample is used in this study, which contains homogeneous classifications of all galaxies brighter than B=12.5 in the northern hemisphere.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main result of the paper is that there is no difference in the percentage of active and quiescent galaxies with companions for different activity types when the host galaxy morphology is taken into account. The author separates the sample by the host galaxy's morphological type (ellipticals or spirals) to avoid the morphology-density effect, which may have been a source of previous results that showed a larger percentage of companions around Seyferts. A large portion of LINERs and transition galaxies are in ellipticals or S0s, while a considerable portion of Seyferts and HII galaxies are found in late-type galaxies. When the sample is separated by the host galaxy's morphological type (elliptical or spiral), there is no difference in the percentage of galaxies with companions for different activity types.

**Methodology/Approach**

The paper uses the Palomar survey, which contains homogeneous classifications of all galaxies brighter than B=12.5 in the northern hemisphere. The author considers a galaxy to have a companion if the distance between it and the possible companion is smaller than 5 times the diameter of the primary galaxy. Also, the brightnesses of the two galaxies cannot differ by more than 3 magnitudes, and the difference between their radial velocities should be smaller than 1000 km s-1.

**Results/Data**

The left panel of Figure 1 shows the percentage of galaxies with companions as a function of the distance between them for the five activity classes defined in the paper. The right panel shows the results for late-type galaxies only, and the middle panel is for early-type (elliptical or S0) galaxies only. There are no differences in the percentage of galaxies with companions for different activity types when the sample is separated by the host galaxy's morphological type.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The study does not take into account the morphology-density effect, which may have been a source of previous results that showed a larger percentage of companions around Seyferts. The paper suggests that the above result was due to this eﬀect. Implications of this result are discussed in Schmitt (2001).
