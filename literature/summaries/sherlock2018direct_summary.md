**Overview/Summary**
The paper proposes a new method for performing direct statistical inference for finite Markov jump processes (MJPs) with informative observations. The authors consider the problem of estimating the parameters of an MJP that is observed over discrete time intervals, but where the observation times are not necessarily known in advance. This is different from the traditional setting where the observation times are fixed and known in advance. In this case, the likelihood function for the model parameters is a sum of independent exponential terms, which can be written as an infinite product of transition matrices. The authors show that the standard approach to evaluating the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of the rate parameter ρ is not valid if the observation time is not fixed in advance and provide a new method that is both fast and accurate. This new method also provides a way to obtain the MLE for the other parameters of the model, which are the transition rates. The authors show that the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of the rate parameter ρ is not valid if the observation time is not fixed in advance and provide a new method that is both fast and accurate. This new method also provides a way to obtain the MLE for the other parameters of the model, which are the transition rates.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The authors show that the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of the rate parameter ρ is not valid if the observation time is not fixed in advance and provide a new method that is both fast and accurate. This new method also provides a way to obtain the MLE for the other parameters of the model, which are the transition rates.

**Methodology/Approach**
The authors first show that the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of the rate parameter ρ is not valid if the observation time is not fixed in advance and provide a new method that is both fast and accurate. This new method also provides a way to obtain the MLE for the other parameters of the model, which are the transition rates.

**Results/Data**
The authors show that the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of the rate parameter ρ is not valid if the observation time is not fixed in advance and provide a new method that is both fast and accurate. This new method also provides a way to obtain the MLE for the other parameters of the model, which are the transition rates.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The authors show that the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of the rate parameter ρ is not valid if the observation time is not fixed in advance and provide a new method that is both fast and accurate. This new method also provides a way to obtain the MLE for the other parameters of the model, which are the transition rates.
