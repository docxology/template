Title: From time- series transcriptomics to gene regulatory networks
Abstract: Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) are complex systems that describe the interactions between transcription factors (TFs) and their target genes in a cell. The study of GRNs is important for understanding how specific TFs contribute to the cell state transition during development, differentiation or disease progression. In this review, we give an overview of the concept of GRN, its topological characteristics and describe the main GRN inference methods.
1. Overview
GRNs are complex systems that describe the interactions between transcription factors (TFs) and their target genes in a cell. The study of GRNs is important for understanding how specific TFs contribute to the cell state transition during development, differentiation or disease progression. In this review, we give an overview of the concept of GRN, its topological characteristics and describe the main GRN inference methods.
2. Key Contributions/Findings
The study of GRNs is important for understanding how specific TFs contribute to the cell state transition during development, differentiation or disease progression. With the increasing abundance of transcriptomics data, data-derived GRNs have the potential to capture novel gene interactions and help to expand our knowledge of important molecular pathways. Despite the increasing interest in developing high performing GRN inference methods and this field of research having been active for more than 20 years, oftenthe application of even the best performing methodsin real- case studies raises questions about their reliability and purely data-driven GRN inference remains still an open challenge, especially in single- cell RNAseq. Recent promising research addresses the challenge of networkinferenceinthepresenceof incompletemulti-omicsdatasets, resulting in the development of advanced computational methods(1). Weassumethat many of these challenges will beaddressedinthenewinferencemethods to bedeveloped in the future.

5. Limitations/Discussion
One of the most difficult challenges in performing data-driven GRNinferenceisvalidatingtheresults and estimating the method performance in real- case studies. Benchmarking theinference methods withsimulated datasets from a priori knowledgenetwork(PKN) andasmalllist of genescanbeanefficient waytoestimatethemethods' performance. But thisisfarfromreal- case studies, wheretheactual regulatorymechanismsaremostlyunknownand- insome cases  - experimentally unexplored. Therefore using public databases (usually built onbulk- RNAseq) for validating theinferred GRNscanbelimitedtosmall- sizeGRNs andnarrowedaround the highly studiedregulatorypathways. Consequently, thisleadstobiasedconclusionsandareal difficultyinidentifyingnovel regulatorypathwaysthat might playan important role in the cell state transition.
