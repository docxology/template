**Overview/Summary**

Simultaneous directional inference is a statistical method for making inferences about multiple parameters from data with no prior knowledge of which direction the effect of an intervention will be. The authors propose a new approach that combines the benefits of two existing methods, simultaneous confidence intervals and directional testing. In this paper, they show how to construct nonnegative lower bounds for the number of positive parameters (n+) in a set of multiple hypotheses with no prior knowledge about the direction of the effect. This is achieved by using the same adaptive local tests that are used in the second step of the existing methods. The authors also provide an example of how this new approach can be applied to a real data analysis.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

This paper proposes a new method for simultaneous directional inference, which combines the benefits of two existing approaches: simultaneous confidence intervals and directional testing. In this paper, they show that it is possible to construct nonnegative lower bounds for the number of positive parameters (n+) in a set of multiple hypotheses with no prior knowledge about the direction of the effect. This is achieved by using the same adaptive local tests that are used in the second step of the existing methods. The authors also provide an example of how this new approach can be applied to a real data analysis.

**Methodology/Approach**

The paper begins by introducing the problem and discussing two existing approaches for simultaneous directional inference: simultaneous confidence intervals (SCIs) and directional testing (DT). For SCIs, the first step is to select a set of hypotheses that are likely to have positive parameters. The second step is to use adaptive local tests to construct nonnegative lower bounds for n+. For DT, the first step is to select a set of hypotheses that are likely to have positive parameters. The second step is also to use adaptive local tests to construct nonnegative lower bounds for n+, but in this case the selection of the test statistics and the p-values used for testing is different from SCIs. The authors then propose their new approach, which combines the benefits of the two existing approaches: the first step is to select a set of hypotheses that are likely to have positive parameters; the second step is to use the same adaptive local tests as in the second step of the existing methods and the p-values used for testing are also the same. The authors show how this new approach can be applied to a real data analysis.

**Results/Data**

The paper presents an example of how their new approach can be applied to a real data analysis. This is done by using the same adaptive local tests as in the second step of the existing methods and the p-values used for testing are also the same. The authors show that the lower bound for n+ with this new approach is nonnegative, which is an improvement over the bounds for n+ with SCIs.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The paper discusses the limitations of their proposed method. They compare their new approach to the existing methods and discuss future work. In particular, they mention that their new approach can be used in other situations where the first step of the two existing approaches is not suitable for a given data analysis.
