**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Perceptual Motor Learning with Active Inference Framework" by Nooraini Sauer, Nastaran Savinov, and Alexander Geiger presents a novel approach to the problem of learning affordances for autonomous driving. The authors propose an active inference (AI) framework that integrates imitation learning and deep reinforcement learning, which is called CAIL (Conditional Affordance Learning with Active Inference). This paper is organized as follows. First, the authors provide an overview of the current state-of-the-art in the field of affordance learning for autonomous driving. Next, the key contributions and findings are discussed. The methodology and approach used to conduct this research are then presented. Then, the results are described. Finally, the limitations and future work are discussed.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contribution of this paper is the integration of active inference (AI) with imitation learning for autonomous driving. This method is called CAIL (Conditional Affordance Learning with Active Inference). The authors demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods in the field of affordance learning, which are based on a deep reinforcement learning framework. The main finding of this paper is that the proposed AI-based imitation learning can successfully learn to predict future frames and drive in complex urban environments.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors first provide an overview of the current state-of-the-art in the field of affordance learning for autonomous driving. Then, they present the CAIL framework. The authors use a minigrid environment as the testbed for the proposed approach. In this environment, the agent is trained to predict future frames based on its own observations and the ground truth. The authors also train an additional model that can be used as a teacher to provide implicit affordances. The authors then compare the performance of the CAIL framework with other state-of-the-art methods in the field of affordance learning. The authors use the CARLA (Conditional Affordance Learning for Autonomous Driving) dataset, which is a large-scale driving benchmark. The proposed approach is compared with two state-of-the-art approaches: one based on a deep reinforcement learning framework and another based on an AI-based imitation learning. The results show that the CAIL framework outperforms both of these methods.

**Results/Data**

The authors use the CARLA dataset, which contains 100 hours of driving data in 10 different scenarios. The proposed approach is compared with two state-of-the-art approaches: one based on a deep reinforcement learning framework and another based on an AI-based imitation learning. The results show that the CAIL framework outperforms both of these methods.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors discuss the limitations and future work in this paper. The authors point out that the proposed approach is not perfect, but it is a good start for the field of affordance learning. The authors also mention some potential future work. For example, the authors suggest that the proposed method can be combined with contrastive AI to further improve its performance.
