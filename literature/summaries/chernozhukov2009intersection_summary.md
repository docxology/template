**Overview/Summary**

This paper presents a new strategy for constructing half- median-unbiased estimators and one-sided interval estimators for the unknown population proportion θ0 when the sample proportion is not necessarily close to θ0. The authors' approach, called an adaptive inequality selector (AIS), uses a problem-dependent critical value kn,V(γn) which is a bound on a high quantile of sup v∈V Z∗n(v). The AIS is based on the new set estimator ˆVn, and it has two main components: the auxiliary critical value kn,V(γn) and the principal critical value kn,ˆVn(p), p ≥ 1/2. The authors show that with probability approaching one, the inferential process concentrates on a neighborhood of V0 given by Vn, where the "size" of the neighborhood is determined by κn, a high quantile of sup v∈V Z∗n(v). The paper also shows that in some special cases, e.g. when V0 is a well-identified singleton, the inference process will in fact concentrate on V0. In this case the authors' simulation-based procedure will automatically produce a critical value that approaches the p-th quantile of the standard normal, delivering asymptotically exact inference.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of the paper are the following. First, the authors show that with probability approaching one, the inferential process concentrates on a neighborhood of V0 given by Vn, where the "size" of the neighborhood is determined by κn, a high quantile of sup v∈V Z∗n(v). Second, in some special cases, e.g. when V0 is a well-identified singleton, the inference process will in fact concentrate on V0. In this case the authors' simulation-based procedure will automatically produce a critical value that approaches the p-th quantile of the standard normal, delivering asymptotically exact inference.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use the problem-dependent critical value kn,V(γn) to obtain a preliminary set estimator ˆVn. The set estimator ˆVn is then used in the construction of the principal critical value kn,ˆVn(p), p ≥ 1/2. The principal and auxiliary critical values are constructed below so as to satisfy (3.4) and (3.6) using either analytical or simulation methods. The authors show that with probability approaching one, the inferential process will in fact concentrate on V0 when it is a well-identified singleton. In this case their simulation-based procedure will automatically produce a critical value that approaches the p-th quantile of the standard normal, delivering asymptotically exact inference.

**Results/Data**

The authors' construction relies first on an auxiliary critical value kn,V(γn), chosen so that wp → 1, kn,V(γn) ≥ κn,V  (3.4), where we set γn := 1 − 0.1/ℓn ր 1 and γn ≥ γ′
n = γn − o(1) ր 1. This critical value is used to obtain a preliminary set estimator ˆVn, which is then used in the construction of the principal critical value kn,ˆVn(p), p ≥ 1/2, where we require that wp → 1, kn,ˆVn
( p ) ≥ κn,Vn  (3.6). The authors show that with probability approaching one, the inferential process will in fact concentrate on V0 when it is a well-identified singleton. In this case their simulation-based procedure will automatically produce a critical value that approaches the p-th quantile of the standard normal, delivering asymptotically exact inference.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors' construction does not allow for the inferential process to concentrate on smaller subsets than Vn. However, in some special cases, e.g. when V0 is a well-identified singleton, the inference process will in fact concentrate on V0. In this case their simulation-based procedure will automatically produce a critical value that approaches the p-th quantile of the standard normal, delivering asymptotically exact inference.
