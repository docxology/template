**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Scene Construction, Visual Foraging, and Active Inference" by Mirza et al. (2019) presents a theoretical framework for the active inference process in visual perception. The authors argue that the brain is not simply a passive receiver of sensory information but an active participant in the construction of the world through its own internal processes. They propose that the brain actively constructs the scene and uses this constructed scene to generate the sensory data it receives. This means that the brain's internal state (the "world") is the cause, rather than the effect, of the sensory data. The paper shows how this process can be used to explain a range of phenomena in visual perception, including the progressive resolution of uncertainty and the overconfidence associated with mean field approximations.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contribution of the paper is the development of an active inference scheme that generates the same search trajectory as the human eye. The authors show how this can be achieved by a simple, on-line algorithm that uses only the current sensory data and the agent's internal state (the "world") to generate the next saccade. They also demonstrate the overconfidence associated with mean field approximations in the context of visual search.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use the variational free energy principle, which is a mathematical framework for understanding the active inference process. The key idea is that the brain's internal state (the "world") and the sensory data are two sides of the same coin: they are both 

**Results/Data**

The results are presented in terms of the simulated visual search task. The authors show that the active inference scheme can generate the same search trajectory as the human eye. This means that the algorithm generates the next saccade based only upon the current sensory data and the agent's internal state (the "world"). They also demonstrate the overconfidence associated with mean field approximations in the context of visual search.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors note that the paper is a theoretical study. The authors suggest that the brain may use marginal representations, which are not assumed by the active inference scheme presented here. This means that the brain can infer the world from the sensory data and also use the world to generate the sensory data. They argue that this duality is used in a range of different visual search tasks. The paper does not discuss any limitations or future work.
