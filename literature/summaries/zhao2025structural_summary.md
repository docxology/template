**Overview/Summary**

This research paper presents a comprehensive study on the structural characteristics of the Slurry-Filled Receptive (SF-R) field in longwall goafs. The authors propose a mechanistic framework that links overburden structural mechanics with backfill engineering, enabling the rational design of grouting parameters and hole layouts to enhance efficiency and control slurry placement.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The study identifies the Slurry Movement Control (SM-C) stratum as the key controlling horizon governing the architecture and functionality of the SF-R field. The authors demonstrate that the SM-C stratum regulates slurry migration by controlling fracture evolution, storage zone formation, and void connectivity. The research also highlights the importance of structural zonation in the SF-R field, comprising free accumulation, load-affected, and compacted zones.

**Methodology/Approach**

The study employs a combination of physical simulation, theoretical analysis, and field practice to investigate the SF-R field structure. The authors use numerical modeling to simulate slurry migration and storage behavior under different grouting conditions. Field experiments are conducted at Huangling No.2 Coal Mine to validate the theoretical framework and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design approach.

**Results/Data**

The research findings indicate that the SM-C stratum plays a crucial role in controlling slurry migration and storage behavior. The study demonstrates that targeting the superimposed area between the free accumulation and load-affected zones can optimize grouting efficiency and control slurry placement. Field experiments at Huangling No.2 Coal Mine confirm the effectiveness of the proposed design approach, achieving superior grout-ability and efficient transport and storage within a well-connected void network.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The study acknowledges limitations in its scope and methodology, including the need for further research on the SM-C stratum's evolution and the impact of varying geological conditions. The authors also highlight potential applications and future work directions, such as integrating the SF-R field theory with other engineering disciplines to enhance overall system performance.

**Conclusion**

This comprehensive study provides a mechanistic framework for understanding the structural characteristics of the SF-R field in longwall goafs. By linking overburden structural mechanics with backfill engineering, the research offers a rational design approach for optimizing grouting parameters and hole layouts. The findings have significant implications for improving efficiency and control in slurry filling operations, making this study a valuable contribution to the field of engineering.
