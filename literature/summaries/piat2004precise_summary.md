**Overview/Summary**

The BRAIN and CLOVER experiments are two complementary projects designed to measure the cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization from Dome-C in Antarctica. The primary goal of this program is to detect the B-modes, which are a signature of primordial gravity waves that could have been produced during an early period of rapid expansion known as inflation. This prediction remains untested and is one of the next challenges in observational cosmology. In addition to providing a major discovery for cosmology, the detection of gravity waves from inflation would also be a landmark achievement for fundamental physics, as it would satisfy one of Einstein's primary objectives of modern physics: detecting these waves predicted by his General Relativity. The B-modes would directly give us the energy scale of inflation and hence the characteristic energy scale of unification physics. The CLOVER experiment is designed to map the primordial B-modes together with the lensed E-modes converted into B-modes, which could provide complementary cosmological information such as neutrino masses.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The BRAIN (Bolometric Real-time Interferometry for Astrophysics and Cosmology) experiment is a prototype of bolometric interferometry that will be developed in an international consortium. The instrument has two complementary experiments with different instrumental approaches, both using bolometers as the detectors. The first one is a new instrumental concept, which is being developed to increase angular resolution. Although originally developed to increase angular resolution, this approach offers several advantages over direct imaging for observations of the CMB anisotropies, including: (i) An intrinsically differential measurement, since one directly obtains the Fourier modes of the sky distribution; (ii) The unique sky tracking of the complete set of N antennas of the array allows the astrophysical signal to be separated from other sources on spurious signals. (iii) A direct polarization measurement as output of the correlator, instead of a determination based on the difference of two total power measurements. These advantages together with the intrinsic sensitivity of bolometers are strong motivation for the development of a combined system. The BRAIN experiment is a prototype that will be installed in Dome-C during the Antarctic summer 2005-06. It will be followed by a BRAIN version 2 with 3 bands (90, 150, 220GHz) each with 256 horns to look for B-modes. This complete instrument could be ready for operation in 2008 with a major contribution from French and Italian teams.

The CLOVER experiment is a bolometric imager aimed at mapping the primordial B-modes together with the lensed E-modes converted into B-modes. These lensed B-modes can lead to complementary cosmological information, such as neutrino masses. The CLOVER experiment uses 4 telescopes at 90 degrees of the cryostat that image the same part of the sky on 4 arrays of 64 horns. Each detection chain is based on a pseudo-correlator scheme (see Fig. 2). It uses similar microwave components as BRAIN and allows to obtain for each pixel an EM signal that is proportional to one of the Stokes parameter Q or U. The EM signal is furthermore converted into an electrical current with a finline structure. Each 4 currents coming from the same pixel on the sky are added and dissipated in a matched resistance on a small TES bolometer. This strategy allows to increase the signal-to-noise ratio with a relatively small number of detectors. The final CLOVER instrument will map the sky in 3 bands (90, 150, 220GHz) each with 4 telescopes and 64 TES. The complete instrument should be ready for operation in 2008.

**Results/Data**

The expected errors from the BRAIN-2 experiment on the B-mode power spectrum are shown in Fig. 1. The CLOVER experiment will map the sky in 3 bands (90, 150, 220GHz) each with 4 telescopes and 64 TES. The complete instrument should be ready for operation in 2008.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The BRAIN-2 and CLOVER experiments are a first phase to develop a dedicated post-Planck satellite that will be launched around the 2015-2020 horizon.
