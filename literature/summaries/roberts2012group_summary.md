**Overview/Summary**

The paper by Roberts and Goldstone (2006) presents a study on group foraging in dynamic environments. The authors investigate how the presence of public information about other foragers' success affects the rate at which a group adjusts to changes in its environment, and whether this use of public information is more common when the food is visible or invisible. The paper uses an experimental paradigm where participants are given a virtual foraging task that requires them to switch between two patches with different payoffs based on their own past success. The authors find that the group's rate of adjustment to environmental changes depends on whether the food is visible and whether the other foragers' success is indicated or not, but the presence of public information does not affect the efficiency of the food collection in the four conditions tested.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main finding of this study is that when the environment shifts, people tend to rely more on their own personal information than on the public information about others. The authors find that if the food is visible, they do not use other foragers as sources of information and instead focus on the food itself. In contrast, when the food is invisible, people are more likely to use the success of other foragers as a source of information in order to adjust their behavior. This finding is surprising because it suggests that people tend to be less responsive to public information about others' success than previously thought. The authors also find that if the environment changes and the food is visible, there is no indication that people use the recent success of other foragers as a source of information. Instead, they seem to only focus on the food itself. This finding is surprising because it suggests that people tend to be less responsive to public information about others' success than previously thought. The authors also find that if the environment changes and the food is invisible, there is no indication that the recent success of other foragers affects how quickly a group adjusts to the environmental change.

**Methodology/Approach**

The study used an experimental paradigm where participants were given a virtual foraging task. In this task, they are required to switch between two patches with different payoffs based on their own past success. The authors tested four conditions: (1) food is visible and no one's success is indicated; (2) food is visible but others' success is indicated; (3) food is invisible and no one's success is indicated; and (4) food is invisible and others' success is indicated. In the first two conditions, participants are only able to see their own past success. The authors tested 12 participants in each of these four conditions, for a total of 48 participants. The study was conducted in a controlled laboratory environment.

**Results/Data**

The results show that when the food is visible and no one's success is indicated, the group's rate of adjustment to environmental changes is .553. When the food is visible but others' success is indicated, the group's rate of adjustment is .675. The authors find that if the food is invisible and no one's success is indicated, the group's rate of adjustment is .031. When the food is invisible but others' success is indicated, the group's rate of adjustment is .071. In all four conditions, the group's rate of adjustment to environmental changes is higher when the food is visible than when it is not. The authors also find that foragers adjust more quickly to the environmental change in the condition where the food is invisible and others' success is indicated than in the other three conditions.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The study does not address how the use of public information affects the efficiency of the food collection, which may be an important consideration. The authors also do not discuss why there was no effect of recent foragers' success on the rate at which a group adjusts to environmental changes when the food is visible. However, this finding could be related to the fact that the study only tested one type of public information about others' success (i.e., the indication of the other forager's success). The authors also do not discuss why there was no effect of recent foragers' success on the rate at which a group adjusts to environmental changes when the food is visible. However, this finding could be related to the fact that the study only tested one type of public information about others' success (i.e., the indication of the other forager's success).
