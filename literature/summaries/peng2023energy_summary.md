**Overview/Summary**

The paper presents a novel approach to minimize the total energy cost of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UA V) in an active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided system with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). The authors consider a SWIPT system with multiple users, where the RIS is equipped with both active and passive elements. In this system, the RIS can be configured to actively reflect signals and also passively reflect signals without any energy consumption. However, the RIS has limited degrees of freedom (DoF) for reconfiguration. The authors formulate an optimization problem to minimize the total energy cost by alternately optimizing the trajectories, the hovering time and the reflection vectors at the active RIS based on the successive convex approximation method. The simulation results show that the active RIS-aided system performs better in terms of energy saving than the passive RIS-aided system under the same energy resources in the UA V-enabled systems.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:

1. **Optimization problem formulation**: The authors formulate an optimization problem to minimize the total energy cost by alternately optimizing the trajectories, the hovering time and the reflection vectors at the active RIS. The optimization problem is non-convex due to the coupling between the DoF and the channel gains.
2. **Successive convex approximation (SCA) method**: The authors use the SCA method to solve the formulated optimization problem. The SCA method is a widely used iterative algorithm that can be used to find the global optimal solution of a non-convex optimization problem by iteratively approximating it with a sequence of convex problems.
3. **Simulation results**: The simulation results show that the active RIS-aided system performs better in terms of energy saving than the passive RIS-aided system under the same energy resources in the UA V-enabled systems.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors consider an SWIPT system with multiple users, where the RIS is equipped with both active and passive elements. In this system, the RIS can be configured to actively reflect signals and also passively reflect signals without any energy consumption. However, the RIS has limited degrees of freedom (DoF) for reconfiguration. The authors formulate an optimization problem to minimize the total energy cost by alternately optimizing the trajectories, the hovering time and the reflection vectors at the active RIS based on the SCA method.

**Results/Data**

The simulation results show that the active RIS-aided system performs better in terms of energy saving than the passive RIS-aided system under the same energy resources in the UA V-enabled systems. The convergence of proposed algorithm, indicates that it converges within a few iterations and exhibits no noticeable fluctuations.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The main limitation of this paper is that the authors do not consider the channel estimation error at the RIS. In practical system, the channel estimation errors are inevitable. This will be considered in future work. The authors also do not discuss the fairness issue between different users. If the DoF is limited, it may lead to unfairness among different users. Therefore, this should be discussed in future work.
