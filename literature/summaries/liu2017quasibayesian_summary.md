Title: Quasi-Bayesian Inference for Production Frontiers with Spotted Outliers
Abstract: This paper proposes a new method of quasi-Bayesian inference for production frontiers when the data contain some outliers. The proposed method is based on the idea that if we can identify the outliers in advance, then the estimation and inference will be more accurate than the traditional methods. In this paper, we propose a method to detect the outliers by the minimum distance from the data point to the estimated frontier. The proposed method is called "Quasi-Bayesian" because it uses the Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the data point being an outlier. We also compare our method with three existing methods: 1) the "Mom" method, which is based on the idea that if we can identify the outliers in advance, then the estimation and inference will be more accurate than the traditional methods; 2) the "Momt pick" method, which is a combination of the "Mom" method and the P-type value method; 3) the "Pwm" method, which is based on the idea that if we can identify the outliers in advance, then the estimation and inference will be more accurate than the traditional methods. The proposed method is compared with three existing methods by using Monte Carlo simulations. The results show that our method is better than the other three methods. We also apply the quasi-Bayesian method to estimate and infer the production frontier for a real data set.
