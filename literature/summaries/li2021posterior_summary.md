**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Posterior Inference for Quantile Regression: Adaptation to Random Design" by [Authors] is a work in the field of Bayesian statistics that investigates the posterior inference problem for quantile regression with random design. The authors propose a novel approach based on the empirical likelihood and score function, which can be used to obtain the posterior distribution of the parameters in the model. They also provide an efficient algorithm to compute the posterior mean and variance. The paper is organized as follows.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this work are threefold. First, a new method for posterior inference based on the empirical likelihood and score function is proposed. Second, the authors show that the proposed method can be used to obtain the posterior distribution of the parameters in the model. Third, they provide an efficient algorithm to compute the posterior mean and variance.

**Methodology/Approach**

The paper first introduces a general framework for Bayesian quantile regression with random design. Then it proposes a novel approach based on the empirical likelihood and score function. The authors also show that the proposed method can be used to obtain the posterior distribution of the parameters in the model. Finally, they provide an efficient algorithm to compute the posterior mean and variance.

**Results/Data**

The paper shows that the proposed method can be used to obtain the posterior distribution of the parameters in the model. It also provides a numerical example for the proposed algorithm.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors point out some limitations and future work. The first limitation is that the proposed method may not perform well when the dimensionality of the covariates p is large. This is because the computational cost of the proposed method increases with p. The second limitation is that the proposed method may not be efficient for high-dimensional data. The authors also point out some future work.
