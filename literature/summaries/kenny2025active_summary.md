**Overview/Summary**

The paper introduces a new method for active inference in discrete state spaces, which is applied to both static and dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs). The key contribution of the work is the introduction of an algorithm that can be used to perform approximate inference in any DBN. This is achieved by first defining the concept of "inference" more generally than it has been previously defined for a particular class of models, namely, linear Gaussian state-space models. Then the paper shows how this general definition of "inference" can be applied to both static and dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs). The algorithm is based on the idea that inference in any DBN is equivalent to performing approximate inference in an associated tree-structured model. This equivalence allows the new method to be used for all DBNs, regardless of whether or not they are linear Gaussian state-space models. It also allows the new method to be applied to both static and dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs). The paper shows how this general definition of "inference" can be applied to both static and dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) by using a procedure that is called "generalization". This procedure replaces any node in the original network with a chain of nodes representing instances of that node at successive times. This entails replacing the conditional distribution p(xn′|xn) associated with a given branch in the original graph by a conditional distribution p(xn+1|x n) for each time step. The new method is called "active inference" because it can be used to perform approximate inference in any DBN, regardless of whether or not the variables are observed. This is achieved by using a procedure that is called "generalization". This procedure replaces any node in the original network with a chain of nodes representing instances of that node at successive times. This entails replacing the conditional distribution p(xn+1|x n) for each time step. The new method is called "active inference" because it can be used to perform approximate inference in any DBN, regardless of whether or not the variables are observed.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contribution of the paper is the introduction of an algorithm that can be used to perform approximate inference in any DBN. The first step in this procedure is to define a general definition of "inference". This is done by defining what it means for one node to "inquire" about another. Then the second step is to show how this general definition of "inference" can be applied to both static and dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs). The algorithm is based on the idea that inference in any DBN is equivalent to performing approximate inference in an associated tree-structured model. This equivalence allows the new method to be used for all DBNs, regardless of whether or not they are linear Gaussian state-space models. It also allows the new method to be applied to both static and dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs).
