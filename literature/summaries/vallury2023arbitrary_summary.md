**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Arbitrary Ground State Observables from Quantum Computed Moments" by Vallury et al. (2023) presents a new method for estimating the expectation value of an arbitrary observable in the ground state of a quantum system using a deep quantum circuit. The authors' approach is to use the moments expansion, which is a well-known technique in the field of many-body physics, and apply it to the problem of computing the ground-state energy. They show that this method can be used more generally for any observable in the ground state, not just the energy. In particular, they demonstrate the feasibility of their approach by applying it to the 1D Heisenberg antiferromagnetic (HAF) model and the 2D XXZ model. The moments expansion is a non-perturbative method that can be used for both gapped and gapless systems in one dimension. It is also an efficient way of computing the ground-state energy, which has been demonstrated by several previous works. In this paper, they show that it can be used to compute any observable in the ground state. The authors' approach is based on the idea that the moments expansion is a superposition of time-evolved states and thus the expectation value of an arbitrary observable in the ground state can be obtained from the moments of the time-evolved states. They also show that their method can be used to mitigate the effect of noise, which is a major problem for current quantum computers.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors' main contributions are as follows:

1. The authors propose an approach based on the moments expansion for computing any observable in the ground state. This is achieved by using a deep quantum circuit that generates a superposition of time-evolved states and then measuring this superposition.
2. They apply their method to two one-dimensional models, the 1D HAF model and the 2D XXZ model. The authors use a 7-qubit IBM Quantum Experience (QE) processor for the 1D HAF model, which is a nearest-neighbor interacting spin-1/2 model with an arbitrary number of sites. The 2D XXZ model is a two-dimensional lattice model that has a dimerization transition at finite temperature.
3. The authors' approach can be used to mitigate the effect of noise and thus it can be applied to early fault-tolerant quantum computers.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use a superposition of time-evolved states to estimate the expectation value of an arbitrary observable in the ground state. This is based on the fact that the moments expansion is a superposition of time-evolved states and thus the expectation value of an arbitrary observable in the ground state can be obtained from the moments of the time-evolved states. The authors use the 1D HAF model as their first example, which is a nearest-neighbor interacting spin-1/2 model with an arbitrary number of sites. This is achieved by using a 7-qubit IBM Quantum Experience (QE) processor. They also apply their method to the 2D XXZ model, which is a two-dimensional lattice model that has a dimerization transition at finite temperature.

**Results/Data**

The authors' results are as follows:

1. The authors use the 1D HAF model as their first example. This is a nearest-neighbor interacting spin-1/2 model with an arbitrary number of sites. They use a 7-qubit IBM Quantum Experience (QE) processor for this model.
2. The authors also apply their method to the 2D XXZ model, which is a two-dimensional lattice model that has a dimerization transition at finite temperature.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors' main limitations are as follows:

1. The authors use a 7-qubit IBM Quantum Experience (QE) processor for the 1D HAF model and thus their method can only be applied to small systems.
2. The authors do not discuss how to apply their method in the case of more than two dimensions.
