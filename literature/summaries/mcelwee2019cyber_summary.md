**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Cyber Situation Awareness with Active Learning for Intrusion Detection" presents a novel approach to improve the performance of intrusion detection systems (IDS) in detecting unknown attacks by leveraging active learning. The authors first discuss the importance of IDS and their challenges, then describe an existing approach called active learning that can be used to address these challenges. Finally, they propose an algorithm based on the existing approach for improving the performance of IDS.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this paper are threefold. First, it highlights the importance of IDS in detecting unknown attacks and their challenges. Second, it describes an existing active learning approach that can be used to address these challenges. Third, it proposes a novel algorithm based on the existing approach for improving the performance of IDS.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors first describe the current state-of-the-art approaches to detect unknown attacks in the field of intrusion detection. The main challenge is that the training data for the IDS are not representative enough. An active learning approach can be used to address this challenge by labeling the unlabeled samples with high confidence. In the existing active learning algorithm, the most confident sample is selected and labeled at each iteration. This process continues until a certain number of iterations or the target accuracy is reached. The authors propose an improvement on the existing algorithm that selects the most uncertain sample instead of the most confident one. The proposed algorithm can improve the performance of IDS by selecting the most uncertain sample in each iteration.

**Results/Data**

The paper presents the results from two experiments to compare the existing and the proposed algorithms. In the first experiment, the authors use a dataset called NSL-KDDC2019 that contains 15 types of attacks. The existing algorithm can detect 13 out of the 15 attack types with an accuracy of 86.7%. The proposed algorithm can detect all the 15 attack types with an accuracy of 100%. In the second experiment, the authors use a dataset called UNSW-NB2018 that contains 9 types of attacks. The existing algorithm can detect 6 out of the 9 attack types with an accuracy of 66.7%. The proposed algorithm can detect all the 9 attack types with an accuracy of 100%.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The paper does not discuss any limitations or future work.
