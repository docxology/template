**Overview/Summary**

The paper "A KL Divergence and Variational Inference" by Jonathan Huggins, Mikołaj Kasprzak, Trevor Campbell, and Tamara Broderick is a well-structured contribution to the field of statistical inference. The authors provide a theoretical framework for understanding how the size of the KL divergence from a variational approximation to a target distribution can be bounded in terms of the complexity of the posterior distribution and the quality of the optimization procedure used. This paper provides an important step forward in the development of practical methods that are guaranteed to work well, even with misspeciﬁcation.
