**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Breaking the bonds of weak coupling: the dynamic causal modelling" by Friston et al. (2012) is a seminal work in the field of neuroimaging and cognitive neuroscience that presents an innovative approach to the study of brain function, which is based on a novel mathematical framework - the Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM). The authors introduce a new method for inferring causal relationships between different parts of the brain. This paper provides a comprehensive summary of this work.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contribution of this paper is to present an alternative approach to the study of brain function, which is based on the DCM. In contrast with the traditional Granger causality and the Bayesian structural equation modelling (BSEM), the DCM is able to infer causal relationships in a more flexible way. The authors show that the BSEM is not able to deal with non-stationary data, while the DCM can be used for both stationary and non-stationary data. This paper also provides an example of how this new method can be used to study the brain function. The DCM is a general framework that can be applied in many different fields, including economics.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors start with a brief review on the traditional Granger causality and the BSEM. Then they introduce the DCM approach. They show that the DCM is able to infer causal relationships between different parts of the brain by using a combination of linear and non-linear models. The authors also provide an example of how this new method can be used to study the brain function.

**Results/Data**

The paper provides an example of how the DCM can be used to study the brain function. In this example, the authors use the BOLD (blood oxygen level dependent) signal from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to infer causal relationships between different parts of the brain. The authors show that the DCM is able to deal with non-stationary data and it can be used for both stationary and non-stationary data.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The paper also discusses the limitations and future work of this new method. The authors point out that the DCM is a general framework that can be applied in many different fields, including economics.
