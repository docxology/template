**Overview/Summary**
The paper "Estimate of entropy generation rate can spatiotemporally vary" by Di Terlizzi et al. (2024) [1] is a theoretical study that addresses the long-standing question of whether the second law of thermodynamics, which states that the total entropy production in a closed system always increases over time, is violated or not when the system is driven out of equilibrium by an external driving force. The authors provide a general framework for the entropy production rate to be maximized in non-equilibrium steady-state trajectories. They also show that the second law holds if the driving force is time-independent and the total entropy production is defined as the integral over all times, but it can be violated if the driving force is time-dependent and the total entropy production is defined as the integral over a finite time interval. The authors further demonstrate that the entropy production rate in the steady state of the system can be maximized by the external driving force, which is called the "optimal" driving force. In this paper, the authors also show that the second law holds if the total entropy production is defined as the integral over all times and the driving force is time-independent, but it can be violated if the driving force is time-dependent and the total entropy production is defined as the integral over a finite time interval. The authors further demonstrate that the entropy production rate in the steady state of the system can be maximized by the external driving force, which is called the "optimal" driving force.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The main contributions of this paper are threefold. First, the authors provide a general framework for the entropy production rate to be maximized in non-equilibrium steady-state trajectories. Second, the authors show that the second law holds if the total entropy production is defined as the integral over all times and the driving force is time-independent, but it can be violated if the driving force is time-dependent and the total entropy production is defined as the integral over a finite time interval. Third, the authors further demonstrate that the entropy production rate in the steady state of the system can be maximized by the external driving force, which is called the "optimal" driving force.

**Methodology/Approach**
The authors use the stochastic thermodynamics approach to study the nonequilibrium dynamics of a single particle. The stochastic thermodynamics approach was first proposed by Seifert (2005) [2]. In this approach, the total entropy production in a closed system is defined as the integral over all times and it is given by the following formula: $$\Delta S = \int d t \frac{\partial}{\partial t}S(t)}{=}\sum_{i}\frac{\delta Q_i}{T_i},$$ where $Q_i$ are the heat exchanges with the environment at temperature $T_i$, and $\delta Q_i$ is the amount of heat exchanged in a time interval $[t_i, t_{i+1}]$. The authors also use the mutual information between the system and the external driving force as a measure to quantify the irreversibility. In this paper, the authors show that the second law holds if the total entropy production is defined as the integral over all times and the driving force is time-independent, but it can be violated if the driving force is time-dependent and the total entropy production is defined as the integral over a finite time interval.

**Results/Data**
The authors use the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process to study the nonequilibrium dynamics of a single particle. The OU process is a stochastic process that is widely used in physics, chemistry, biology, and other fields. The authors also use the Kramers equation for the entropy production rate. In this paper, the authors show that the second law holds if the total entropy production is defined as the integral over all times and the driving force is time-independent, but it can be violated if the driving force is time-dependent and the total entropy production is defined as the integral over a finite time interval.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The paper does not discuss any limitations or future work. The authors also do not mention how to measure the entropy production rate in a real system. The authors only provide the theoretical results for the entropy production rate, and they do not give any experimental data. This is because the measurement of the entropy production rate is very difficult.
