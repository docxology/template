**Overview/Summary**

The authors of this paper investigate the optimal design problem for active controlled dose finding trials with bivariate outcomes. The objective is to find a treatment schedule that maximizes the probability of correctly identifying the best treatment based on the observed data. In the case where the eﬃcacy and toxicity are uncorrelated, the authors derive upper bounds on the number of support points for locally optimal designs. These upper bounds can be used to reduce the dimensionality of the corresponding optimization problems. The authors also determine minimally supported D-optimal designs explicitly for speciﬁc combinations of models for the eﬃcacy and toxicity and note that in general the minimally supported D-optimal designs are rather eﬃcient, provided that the correlation between eﬃcacy and toxicity is weak. The authors demonstrate that statistical inference in clinical trials with bivariate outcomes can be improved substantially by the appropriate use of eﬃcient designs.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this paper are as follows: (1) The authors derive upper bounds on the number of support points for locally optimal designs. These upper bounds can be used to reduce the dimensionality of the corresponding optimization problems. (2) The authors determine minimally supported D-optimal designs explicitly for speciﬁc combinations of models for the eﬃcacy and toxicity, which are not minimally supported in general. Nevertheless, it is demonstrated that for the models under consideration the minimally supported D-optimal designs are rather eﬃcient, provided that the correlation between eﬃcacy and toxicity is weak.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use a- priori information about the unknown model parameters to address this problem. Locally optimal designs are typically used as benchmarks for common designs. Additionally, locally optimal designs serve as basis for constructing optimal designs with respect to more sophisticated optimality criteria, which are robust against a misspeciﬁcation of the unknown parameters; see Pronzato and Walter (1985) or Chaloner and Verdinelli (1995), Dette (1997) among others. An interesting direction for future research is to further develop the methodology introduced in this paper to address uncertainty in the preliminary information for the unknown parameters.

**Results/Data**

The authors use a metaheuristic PSO-algorithm to calculate locally optimal designs, which are used as benchmarks for common designs. Moreover, the eﬃciencies of the minimally supported D-optimal designs are given by 0.96, 0.81 and 0.34 for the caseρ= 0.1, 0.5, and 0.9, respectively. From the eﬃciencies we see that the minimally supported designs are only eﬃcient if the eﬃcacy and toxicity outcomes are nearly uncorrelated. For a strong correlation between eﬃcacy and toxicity minimally supported designs cannot be recommended. Finally, the values of the lower bounds in  (2.6) for these three minimally supported optimal designs are0.87, 0.67 and 0.18.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors' research demonstrates that statistical inference in clinical trials with bivariate outcomes can be improved substantially by the appropriate use of eﬃcient designs. The paper's results demonstrate that for the models under consideration the minimally supported D-optimal designs are rather eﬃcient, provided that the correlation between eﬃcacy and toxicity is weak. Our results demonstrate that statistical inference in clinical trials with bivariate outcomes can be improved substantially by the appropriate use of eﬃcient designs.
