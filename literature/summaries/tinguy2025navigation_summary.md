**Overview/Summary**
The paper presents a new approach to navigation and exploration in robotics based on active inference (AI). The authors claim this is the first work that uses AI for both navigation and exploration in an integrated way. They argue that the traditional approaches of using either a map-based or a goal-directed method are not sufficient, as they do not effectively address the problem of how to decide which areas of the environment to explore during the process of learning a map. The authors propose a new approach based on active inference (AI) for both navigation and exploration. They claim that AI is an efficient way to learn about the world by making inferences from incomplete information, as it is able to handle the uncertainty in the data and can be used with different types of sensors. The paper also claims that this is the first work that uses AI for both navigation and exploration in an integrated way.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The authors claim several key contributions: 
1. A new approach based on active inference (AI) to learn a map and decide which areas of the environment to explore during the process of learning the map.
2. The use of AI allows for both navigation and exploration in an integrated way, as it is able to handle the uncertainty in the data from different types of sensors. 
3. The authors claim that this is the first work that uses AI for both navigation and exploration in an integrated way.

**Methodology/Approach**
The approach presented in the paper is based on active inference (AI). The authors use a graph-based representation of the environment, where each node represents a state or location. They represent the map as a set of nodes with associated transition probabilities between them. The AI algorithm learns to predict the probability of being at any given state and can be used for both navigation and exploration. In this approach, the agent is able to make inferences from incomplete information by making predictions about the environment based on its current knowledge. This is different from the traditional approaches that use a map or a goal, as these do not address how to decide which areas of the environment to explore during the process of learning the map.

**Results/Data**
The authors present several results and data in the paper. The first result is that the AI algorithm can be used for both navigation and exploration. This is demonstrated with a simulation study using a TurtleBot 3 Waffle, where the agent starts at an unknown location and must decide which areas of the environment to explore during the process of learning the map. The second result is that the approach presented in the paper is able to handle dynamic obstacles. This is demonstrated by moving an obstacle between two states while the agent is exploring a mini warehouse. The third result is that the AI algorithm can be used for both navigation and exploration.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The authors do not discuss any limitations or future work.
