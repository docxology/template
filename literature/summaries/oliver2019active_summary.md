**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Active inference body perception and action for humanoid robots" presents a novel approach to the development of a cognitive architecture that is capable of learning about its own body from sensory data in an embodied manner. The authors propose a new method based on active inference, which is a probabilistic generative model that can be used for both perception and control. They argue that this framework has several advantages over existing approaches such as the internal model theory or the schema theory. First, it provides a unified explanation of how the body is perceived and controlled in an embodied manner. Second, the active inference approach does not require any prior knowledge about the body's shape or its parts. The authors also show that this new method can be used for both online and offline learning.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contribution of this paper is a novel cognitive architecture that uses the active inference framework to learn about the body in an embodied manner. This approach has several advantages over existing approaches such as the internal model theory or the schema theory. It provides a unified explanation of how the body is perceived and controlled in an embodied manner. The authors also show that this new method can be used for both online and offline learning.

**Methodology/Approach**

The paper uses the active inference framework to learn about the body in an embodied manner. This approach has several advantages over existing approaches such as the internal model theory or the schema theory. It provides a unified explanation of how the body is perceived and controlled in an embodied manner. The authors also show that this new method can be used for both online and offline learning.

**Results/Data**

The results section describes the experiments that were conducted to test the proposed approach. The first experiment was designed to test the ability of the robot to learn about its own body from sensory data. In this experiment, the robot was able to learn about its own body in an embodied manner. This is a result that has not been achieved before. The second experiment was designed to compare the performance of the proposed approach with existing approaches. The authors show that their new method outperforms the existing methods.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The limitations section discusses the potential weaknesses and future work for this paper. The first limitation is that the active inference framework has not been tested on other robots or in different scenarios. This is a common problem with all papers, but it is more important to address this issue when the new method is proposed. The second limitation is that the authors only use the robot's visual and proprioceptive data for learning. In the future work, they would like to include the auditory data as well.
