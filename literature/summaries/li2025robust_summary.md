**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Robust Sampling for Active Statistical Inference" by [Authors] proposes a novel approach to active statistical inference that is robust against the worst-case distribution. The authors first propose a general framework of active statistical inference, which can be used in various settings such as causal inference and online learning. Then they introduce a new algorithm called "Robust Sampling for Active Statistical Inference" (RSASI) that can be applied to both batch and online data. The main idea is to use the worst-case distribution as the budget-allocating rule, which makes the variance of the estimator robust against the worst-case distribution. They also provide a theoretical analysis of the proposed algorithm.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The paper provides several key contributions. First, it proposes a general framework for active statistical inference that can be used in various settings such as causal inference and online learning. Second, it introduces a new algorithm called "Robust Sampling for Active Statistical Inference" (RSASI) that can be applied to both batch and online data. The main idea is to use the worst-case distribution as the budget-allocating rule, which makes the variance of the estimator robust against the worst-case distribution. They also provide a theoretical analysis of the proposed algorithm.

**Methodology/Approach**

The paper first proposes a general framework for active statistical inference that can be used in various settings such as causal inference and online learning. Then they introduce a new algorithm called "Robust Sampling for Active Statistical Inference" (RSASI) that can be applied to both batch and online data. The main idea is to use the worst-case distribution as the budget-allocating rule, which makes the variance of the estimator robust against the worst-case distribution. They also provide a theoretical analysis of the proposed algorithm.

**Results/Data**

The paper provides several key results. First, it shows that the variance of the RSASI is always less than or equal to the variance of the original active statistical inference. Second, it gives an upper bound for the difference between the two variances. Third, it shows that the worst-case distribution as the budget-allocating rule can be used in both batch and online data.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The paper also discusses several limitations. First, the proposed algorithm is not applicable to the case where the worst-case distribution is unknown. Second, the proposed algorithm is only for the active statistical inference with a single sample. The authors suggest that it may be possible to extend the proposed algorithm to the multi-sample setting in the future.

**Additional Comments**

The paper is well-organized and easy to follow. The authors provide a good introduction of the related work, which helps readers understand the context of this paper. The proposed algorithm is also easy to implement. However, the authors do not discuss how to select the worst-case distribution in practice. They only assume that it can be selected. It may be possible for the future research to discuss the selection of the worst-case distribution.
