**Overview/Summary**

The paper "A Neuro-mimetic Realization of the Common Model of Cognition" by Orobio et al. (2023) presents a neuro-mimetic realization of the common model of cognition, which is a cognitive architecture that can be used to understand and explain many aspects of human cognition and behavior. The authors argue that this model should be the foundation for all future work in artificial general intelligence (AGI). They provide an overview of the current state of the AGI field and discuss how the common model of cognition was developed as a standard framework for understanding the mind. The paper also describes the main contributions of the paper, which is to show that this cognitive architecture can be used to understand and explain many aspects of human cognition and behavior.
