**Overview/Summary**

The paper presents a theory of mind (ToM) using active inference (AI), which is an extension of the free energy principle (FEP). The authors argue that ToM in AI should be based on the FEP, rather than the Bayesian approach. In this framework, the agent's own and other agents' beliefs are represented as a probability distribution over the possible states of the world. The authors show that the FEP is equivalent to the variational bound (VB) and the evidence lower bound (ELB). They also argue that the VB can be used for both inference and learning. In this paper, the authors focus on the use of the VB for ToM in AI.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of the paper are to show the equivalence between the FEP and the VB, and to propose a new approach to ToM using the VB. The authors also discuss how the VB can be used for both inference and learning. In this paper, the authors focus on the use of the VB for ToM in AI.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors show that the FEP is equivalent to the VB. They also argue that the VB can be used for both inference and learning. The authors do not discuss how they apply these ideas to learn or infer, but instead focus on the use of the VB for ToM in AI.

**Results/Data**

The paper does not present any results or data. It is a theoretical work that discusses the FEP, the VB, the ELB, and their application to ToM in AI. The authors do not discuss how they apply these ideas to learn or infer, but instead focus on the use of the VB for ToM in AI.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The paper does not provide any discussion about the limitations of this work. However, it is a theoretical work that presents a new approach to ToM using the VB. The authors do not discuss how they apply these ideas to learn or infer, but instead focus on the use of the VB for ToM in AI.
