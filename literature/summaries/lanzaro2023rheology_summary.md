Title: Rheology of active fluids
Authors: Alfredo Fernandes-Souza, et al.

Overview/Summary:
The rheology of active fluids is a rapidly growing field that has attracted much attention in the last few years. The main goal of this review is to provide an overview of recent advances and open questions in the subject. The authors first discuss the basic concepts of the rheology of non-equilibrium systems, including the concept of the effective temperature, the role of the noise, the effect of the boundary conditions on the steady state flow curves, the existence of a maximum in the shear stress curve for a system with a single internal variable and the possibility of the negative heat capacity. The authors then discuss the rheology of active fluids with a single internal variable, including the case where the effective temperature is time-independent or time-dependent, and the case where the noise is absent or present. The paper also discusses the rheology of active fluids with two internal variables.
