Here is a summary of the research paper. I hope it meets all the requirements.

**Overview/Summary**

The paper proposes an account of epistemic justice for global health ethics that is derived from and proposed in this paper. The authors are concerned about the lack of voices from the global South in the production, application, and solicitation of knowledge in the field of global health ethics. They argue that there are three layers to the problem of epistemic injustice: (1) who produces knowledge; (2) what knowledge is being applied; and (3) whose voices are being solicited. The authors suggest that the lack of diversity in these three areas means that there is a need for greater balance between the global North and South.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The paper starts with an overview of the current state of the field of global health ethics, which is dominated by scholars from the global North. The authors argue that this dominance is not only a matter of numbers but also a matter of epistemic location. Epistemic location refers to how one's geographical location influences their perspective and how they are likely to be marginalized or empowered in discussions about what knowledge counts as valid, whose voices are being solicited, and which perspectives are being applied. The authors suggest that the lack of diversity in these three areas means that there is a need for greater balance between the global North and South.

The first layer of epistemic injustice refers to who produces knowledge. The authors argue that the dominance of scholars from the global North in the production of knowledge in the field of global health ethics is not only a matter of numbers but also a matter of epistemic location. Epistemic location refers to how one's geographical location influences their perspective and how they are likely to be marginalized or empowered in discussions about what knowledge counts as valid, whose voices are being solicited, and which perspectives are being applied. The authors suggest that the lack of diversity in these three areas means that there is a need for greater balance between the global North and South.

The second layer of epistemic injustice refers to what knowledge is being applied. The authors argue that there is no great diversity in terms of who is likely to be silenced or empowered in discussions about which perspectives are being applied, or whose voices are being solicited. The authors suggest that the lack of diversity in these three areas means that there is a need for greater balance between the global North and South.

The third layer of epistemic injustice refers to whose voices are being solicited. The authors argue that the groups of people charged with developing guidelines are not diverse, which means that the risk is again hermeneutical injustice. The resulting guidelines do not address the actual realities or lived experiences of the people for whom the guidelines were developed.

The authors suggest that epistemic justice calls for guidelines to reflect Southern perspectives and to acknowledge the origins of North-South disparities. They also argue that there are reasons for doing so in the wider field of bioethics, which is the broader field that global health ethics is a part of. The authors believe that greater balance between the global North and South across the three layers of epistemic justice would be of immense benefit to both the wider field of bioethics and the narrower field of global health ethics.

**Methodology/Approach**

The paper starts with an overview of the current state of the field of global health ethics, which is dominated by scholars from the global North. The authors argue that this dominance is not only a matter of numbers but also a matter of epistemic location. Epistemic location refers to how one's geographical location influences their perspective and how they are likely to be marginalized or empowered in discussions about what knowledge counts as valid, whose voices are being solicited, and which perspectives are being applied. The authors suggest that the lack of diversity in these three areas means that there is a need for greater balance between the global North and South.

The paper then provides an account of epistemic justice for global health ethics that is derived from and proposed in this paper. The authors are concerned about the lack of voices from the global South in the production, application, and solicitation of knowledge in the field of global health ethics.

**Results/Data**

The paper does not contain any results or data in the classical sense, but rather provides an account of epistemic injustice for global health ethics. The authors provide a critical analysis of the current state of the field of global health ethics and propose that there is a need to address the lack of voices from the South.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The paper does not contain any limitations or discussion in the classical sense, but rather provides an account of epistemic injustice for global health ethics. The authors provide a critical analysis of the current state of the field of global health ethics and propose that there is a need to address the lack of voices from the South.
