**Overview/Summary**
The paper presents an extension of the Variational Free Energy Profile (VFEP) and Multinomial Univariate Hypothesis Adjustment Method (MUHAM) to higher dimensional spaces. The authors apply this approach to a 3D FES, which is the first time that this method has been applied to a 3D system. This paper is focused on the calculation of a 3D FES for the enzymatic transphosphorylation reaction catalyzed by the hammerhead ribozyme (HHr). The authors use the B-spline and MBAR methods to calculate the 3D FES, which are the first time that this method has been applied to a 3D system.
