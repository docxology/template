**Overview/Summary**

The control flow in active inference systems is a fundamental problem in statistical physics and machine learning. The authors of this paper provide an answer to the question whether the control flow can be represented by a tensor network (TN). The authors show that if the control flow can be represented by a TN, then it must be non-trivial. In other words, the control flow is trivial if the system deploys only one QRF and it is non-trivial otherwise. This paper provides a general answer to this question.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors provide an intuitive explanation for why the control flow cannot be represented by a TN in the case that the system deploys multiple, distinct QRFs. The authors also show that if the control flow can be represented by a TN, then it must be non-trivial. This paper provides a general answer to this question. In particular, the authors provide an intuitive explanation for why the control flow cannot be represented by a TN in the case that the system deploys multiple, distinct QRFs.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors prove their main result as follows: Suppose first that the control flow in a system A can be represented by a TN. A TN is, by deﬁnition, a factorization of a tensor operator into a network of tensor operators. This network can be either hierarchical or one-dimensional. The authors show that this tensor can be decomposed into a TN. They prove it as follows: Suppose first that the control flow in a system A can be represented by a TN.
