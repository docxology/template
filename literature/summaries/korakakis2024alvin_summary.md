**Overview/Summary**

The paper "ALVIN: Active Learning Via INterpolation" proposes a new active learning algorithm called ALVIN (Active Learning via INterpolation) that leverages the power of mixup to learn an adaptive interpolation policy for the task. The authors argue that the current state-of-the-art methods are limited in their ability to adapt to different data distributions and can be easily fooled by shortcut learning, which is a phenomenon where the model learns to predict the labels based on the shortcuts rather than the true underlying relationship between the input and output. The proposed ALVIN algorithm is designed to address this problem by learning an adaptive interpolation policy that is tailored to the task at hand. The authors show that the learned policy can be used in conjunction with a variety of different active learning algorithms and can also be used as a standalone algorithm. They demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on three benchmark datasets, including NLI (Natural Language Inference), Sentiment Analysis, and Fine-Grained Aspects.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors first introduce the concept of shortcut learning, which is a phenomenon where the model learns to predict the labels based on the shortcuts rather than the true underlying relationship between the input and output. The authors argue that this problem can be addressed by using an adaptive interpolation policy in active learning.
