**Overview/Summary**

The paper "TAP free energy, spin glasses and variational mean-field" by Fan, Mei, and Montanari (2020) [1] is a theoretical study that investigates the TAP (Thouless-Anderson-Palmer) free energy of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with a general class of non-Gaussian distributions. The authors provide a new perspective on the TAP free energy by using the variational mean-field theory, which allows them to prove the existence and uniqueness of the TAP free energy for the general case. This is an important step forward in our understanding of the TAP free energy as it has been extensively studied in the physics literature for the Gaussian case [2]. The authors also provide a new interpretation of the replica symmetric (RS) solution. In particular, they show that the RS solution can be seen as the variational mean-field theory with a specific choice of the variational family and its associated free energy is the TAP free energy. This provides an alternative way to understand the RS solution.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this paper are the following: 1) The authors prove the existence and uniqueness of the TAP free energy for a general class of non-Gaussian distributions, which can be used as a new starting point in studying the TAP free energy. This is an important step forward to understand the TAP free energy. 2) The authors provide a new interpretation of the replica symmetric (RS) solution by using the variational mean-field theory. The RS solution can be seen as the variational mean-field theory with a specific choice of the variational family and its associated free energy is the TAP free energy, which provides an alternative way to understand the RS solution. 3) The authors also prove that the TAP free energy is the unique fixed point of the variational mean-field theory. This is important in studying the properties of the TAP free energy.

**Methodology/Approach**

The paper is based on a mathematical approach. It uses the concept of the Stieltjes transform, which is a powerful tool to study the distribution of random variables. The authors use the Stieltjes transform and the variational mean-field theory to investigate the TAP free energy. The main technical tool in this paper is the following: Let $g(z)$ be the Stieltjes transform for $\nu$, then the TAP free energy can be expressed as a minimization problem of $F(g)$. This allows them to prove the existence and uniqueness of the TAP free energy. The authors also use the variational mean-field theory to investigate the RS solution, which is the fixed point of this variational family.

**Results/Data**

The main results in this paper are the following: 1) The TAP free energy for a general class of non-Gaussian distributions is the unique minimizer of $F(g)$; 2) The TAP free energy is the fixed point of the variational mean-field theory. These two results provide an alternative way to understand the TAP free energy.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The main limitation in this paper is that it only provides a new perspective on the TAP free energy and its interpretation. It does not provide any new method or technique to study the TAP free energy. The authors also mention some future work, such as studying the properties of the TAP free energy.
