**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Estimation and simulation of foraging trips in land- based central place foragers" by Boyd et al. (2014) is a statistical analysis that aims to describe the movement patterns of adult southern elephant seals at Macquarie Island, Australia. The authors use an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck random walk model with time-varying drift and diffusion to represent the foraging trips of these marine mammals. This paper is part of a broader research program that seeks to understand the variation in the foraging effort of central place foragers using movement models. The main contribution of this study is the development of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck random walk model with time-varying drift and diffusion, which they use to describe the foraging trips of adult southern elephant seals at Macquarie Island, Australia. The authors also estimate the parameters of the model from a data set that contains the first passage times in relation to age and sex.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main finding of this paper is the development of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck random walk model with time-varying drift and diffusion. This new model is used to describe the foraging trips of adult southern elephant seals at Macquarie Island, Australia. The authors use a multistate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck random walk model that includes the effects of sex and age on the movement pattern of these marine mammals. The parameters of this model are estimated from a data set that contains the first passage times in relation to age and sex. The results show that the foraging trips of adult southern elephant seals at Macquarie Island, Australia are influenced by both the sex and the age of the individual. The authors also use the simulation method to estimate the parameters of the model from the data set. The main result is the development of a new random walk model with time-varying drift and diffusion that can be used in other studies.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck random walk model with time-varying drift and diffusion to represent the foraging trips of adult southern elephant seals at Macquarie Island, Australia. The movement patterns of these marine mammals are described using a multistate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck random walk model that includes the effects of sex and age on the movement pattern. The parameters of this new random walk model are estimated from a data set that contains the first passage times in relation to age and sex. The authors also use the simulation method to estimate the parameters of the model from the data set.

**Results/Data**

The results show that the foraging trips of adult southern elephant seals at Macquarie Island, Australia are influenced by both the sex and the age of the individual. The results of this paper can be used in other studies as a new random walk model with time-varying drift and diffusion. The authors also use the simulation method to estimate the parameters of the model from the data set. The main result is the development of a new random walk model with time-varying drift and diffusion that can be used in other studies.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The main limitation of this paper is that it only describes the foraging trips of adult southern elephant seals at Macquarie Island, Australia. It does not describe the movement patterns of juvenile or sub-adult southern elephant seals. The authors also do not consider the effects of environmental variables such as sea ice and krill on the movement pattern of these marine mammals. The authors suggest that future studies should consider the effects of environmental variables on the foraging trips of adult, juvenile and sub-adult southern elephant seals.
