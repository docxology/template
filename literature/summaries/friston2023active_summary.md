**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Active Inference and Intentional Behaviour" is a theoretical study in the field of cognitive science. The authors present an approach to understanding how people can engage in goal-directed behavior without any external reward, such as learning or reinforcement, by using the concept of active inference. This is based on the idea that if there are certain states which lead to ambiguous outcomes, then the agent may avoid those states and instead choose actions that are more likely to produce a clear outcome. The authors use this approach to explain how people can engage in goal-directed behavior without external reward.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contribution of the paper is an explanation for why people can engage in goal-directed behavior without any external reward, such as learning or reinforcement. This is based on the idea that if there are certain states which lead to ambiguous outcomes, then the agent may avoid those states and instead choose actions that are more likely to produce a clear outcome. The authors use this approach to explain how people can engage in goal-directed behavior without external reward.

**Methodology/Approach**

The paper is based on the idea of active inference. This is an approach which is used to understand how people can engage in goal-directed behavior without any external reward, such as learning or reinforcement. The authors use this approach to explain how people can engage in goal-directed behavior without external reward.

**Results/Data**

The results of the paper are based on a simulation of the Pong game. This was done using an artificial neural network which is exposed to 512 observations (about two minutes of simulated time). The configuration of the game is shown above three plots reporting fluctuations in various measures of belief updating, and accompanying behavior. The first graph plots the negative variational free energy as a function of time. The second graph shows the precision or confidence that the agent has about its beliefs regarding the policies it should follow. The third graph shows the Bayesian beliefs that the agent has about the policies it should follow.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The paper does not discuss any limitations to this work, but it is a theoretical study and so there are no empirical results to be discussed. It is also an early stage of research in the field of cognitive science, so there may be many potential avenues for future work. The authors do not suggest any particular direction for future work.
