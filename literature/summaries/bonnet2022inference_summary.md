**Overview/Summary**
Inference of multivariate exponential Hawkes processes with a non-exponential kernel is an important problem in statistics and data science. The multivariate Hawkes process (MHP) is a natural extension of the univariate Hawkes process, which is widely used to model the inter-arrival times of a point process. In this paper, we propose a new approach for inferring the MHP with a non-exponential kernel based on the maximum likelihood estimation. The main contribution of our work is that we can obtain an explicit expression of the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) and its asymptotic distribution. This makes it possible to solve the problem efficiently by using the existing numerical methods, such as the Monte Carlo method. We also compare the performance of our approach with the existing approaches in this paper.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The main contribution of this paper is that we can obtain an explicit expression of the MLE and its asymptotic distribution. This makes it possible to solve the problem efficiently by using the existing numerical methods, such as the Monte Carlo method. We also compare the performance of our approach with the existing approaches in this paper.

**Methodology/Approach**
The maximum likelihood estimation is a widely used statistical inference method. The MLE for the MHP can be obtained by maximizing the log-likelihood function. In this paper, we first give an explicit expression of the MLE and its asymptotic distribution. Then, we compare the performance of our approach with the existing approaches in this paper.

**Results/Data**
The relative squared errors for each group of parameters  ((µi) i, (αij) i, j and (βi) i) are displayed in Figure 3. The p-values for each scenario using both the true parameters and all four estimations from Figure 3 with 25 simulations different from the ones used for estimation are given in Table 2. It shows indeed that our methods obtain high p-values, being very close to those obtained using the true parameters.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The proposed method is not efficient when the number of observations is small. The existing approaches can be used as a reference. The major changes appear in Scenario (3), where both  and  are the two methods with the same kernel functions considered in this paper. In addition, at least one of the proposed methods obtains the highest value forptot in each scenario, which illustrates the ability of these procedures to reconstruct the complete process N.
