**Overview/Summary**
The paper presents a techno-economic analysis of renewable energy generation at the South Pole. The authors first generate detailed solar and wind resource profiles for one year using on-site meteorological data. A techno-economic optimization is then performed to find the least-cost solution to generate 170 kW of electrical power for a period of 15 years. The hybrid renewable system consisting of photovoltaic (PV) solar panels, wind turbine generators, and a lithium-ion (Li-ion) energy storage system integrated with an existing diesel system is able to reduce diesel fuel consumption by 95% resulting in a net present value of $57M. Such a system would require an initial capital investment of $9.7 million with a simple payback period of 2.1 years. Several additional scenarios are modeled, with results ranging from 40% -100% diesel fuel reduction and the associated decarbonization. In all scenarios, renewable energy generation is highly cost effective.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The main contributions of this work are the following:
- The authors present a feasibility analysis for renewable power generation at the South Pole.
- A hybrid renewable system consisting of PV solar panels, wind turbine generators, and a Li-ion energy storage system integrated with an existing diesel system is able to reduce diesel fuel consumption by 95% resulting in a net present value of $57M. Such a system would require an initial capital investment of $9.7 million with a simple payback period of 2.1 years.
- The authors model several additional scenarios, with results ranging from 40% -100% diesel fuel reduction and the associated decarbonization. In all scenarios, renewable energy generation is highly cost effective.

**Methodology/Approach**
The approach used in this work is as follows:
- Detailed solar and wind resource profiles are generated using on-site meteorological data.
- A techno-economic optimization is performed to find the least-cost solution to generate 170 kW of electrical power for a period of 15 years. The hybrid renewable system consisting of PV solar panels, wind turbine generators, and a Li-ion energy storage system integrated with an existing diesel system is able to reduce diesel fuel consumption by 95% resulting in a net present value of $57M. Such a system would require an initial capital investment of $9.7 million with a simple payback period of 2.1 years.
- The authors model several additional scenarios, with results ranging from 40% -100% diesel fuel reduction and the associated decarbonization. In all scenarios, renewable energy generation is highly cost effective.

**Results/Data**
The main findings of this work are the following:
- The hybrid system reduces diesel fuel consumption by 95%.
- The authors model several additional scenarios, with results ranging from 40% -100% diesel fuel reduction and the associated decarbonization. In all scenarios, renewable energy generation is highly cost effective.
- The optimized model is a system with PV and WTG sizes similar to scenario E. The size of the LDES system increases significantly, both in power and energy capacity, although somewhat surprisingly reducing the diesel consumption only by an additional 2.6% and slightly increasing the NPV.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The main limitations of this work are the following:
- Realizing these benefits requires addressing several key technical challenges in the on-site implementation of renewable energy technology at the South Pole environment. Future work will focus on relevant engineering developments for each component.
- The PV system modeled here assumes the panels are installed as a standalone array as opposed to mounted on a building. Windblown snow creates drifts around buildings and other structures mounted on the snow at the South Pole [45]. A strategy for snow drift prevention and maintenance will be required to keep the panels fully operational and to reduce the general impact of drifts at the site.
- One of the main complications of Li-ion energy storage is its flammable nature. While not a unique concern for the South Pole, fire has amplified consequences at such remote sites. During the course of this study, emerging non-flammable Li-ion storage technology was identified and going forward should be preferentially evaluated to meet the storage needs.
- Several elements of wind turbine implementation require development. As noted in Section 2.2 the predicted power generation profile for a wind turbine can be improved through collection of additional wind data at a height of 30 meters above the ground. A more complete wind resource assessment will also include combining this new data with an investigation of long-term trends in the existing meteorological data.
- Wind turbines also have the potential to produce electromagnetic interference (EMI) [46]. The South Pole Station includes the radio-quiet Dark Sector, which hosts scientific experiments that are EMI sensitive [47]. A detailed assessment of EMI from a turbine must be performed and a subsequent mitigation plan including location on site or turbine modifications will be necessary. Additionally, the foundation design for the turbine will require development to determine the viability of a compacted snow foundation.
- A devoted campaign of engineering development has the potential to address the technical challenges noted here, which would pave the way for renewable energy resources and energy storage to become an integral part of decarbonized power generation at the South Pole.
