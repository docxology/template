**Overview/Summary**

The paper by Shankar et al. (2018) [1] is a theoretical study of giant number fluctuations in dry active polar fluids. The authors show that the number of particles in a given region can fluctuate much more than the "law of large numbers" scaling, which is the standard for most equilibrium and non-equilibrium systems. This is true even if the total number of particles is conserved. In fact, the fluctuations are singularly dependent on the shape of the counting box. The authors also show that the giant number fluctuations do not arise from a breakdown of linearized hydrodynamics but rather from long ranged spatial correlations between the fluctuations. These can be determined by an electrostatic analogy. A sharp upward pointing conducting wedge in two dimensions or a cone in three is used to determine the functional form of the correlation function Gd(θ). The authors provide an exact prediction for this function and suggest that it can be tested by measuring the number fluctuations in two widely separated boxes.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main results of the paper are:

1. **Giant Number Fluctuations**: The authors show that the number of particles in a given region can fluctuate much more than the "law of large numbers" scaling, which is the standard for most equilibrium and non-equilibrium systems. This is true even if the total number of particles is conserved. In fact, the fluctuations are singularly dependent on the shape of the counting box. The authors also show that the giant number fluctuations do not arise from a breakdown of linearized hydrodynamics but rather from long ranged spatial correlations between the fluctuations. These can be determined by an electrostatic analogy. A sharp upward pointing conducting wedge in two dimensions or a cone in three is used to determine the functional form of the correlation function Gd(θ). The authors provide an exact prediction for this function and suggest that it can be tested by measuring the number fluctuations in two widely separated boxes.

2. **Non-Equilibrium**: The paper is a theoretical study of non-equilibrium systems, which are characterized by a lack of detailed balance. In particular, the authors consider the case where the total number of particles is conserved but there is no detailed balance between the different species (or "colors") in the system.

3. **Electrostatic Analogy**: The authors show that the correlations can be determined by an electrostatic analogy. A sharp upward pointing conducting wedge in two dimensions or a cone in three is used to determine the functional form of the correlation function Gd(θ). The authors provide an exact prediction for this function and suggest that it can be tested by measuring the number fluctuations in two widely separated boxes.

**Methodology/Approach**

The paper uses hydrodynamic equations of dry active polar fluids. This is a non-equilibrium system where there is no detailed balance between the different species (or "colors") in the system. The authors use these equations to show that the giant number fluctuations do not arise from a breakdown of linearized hydrodynamics but rather from long ranged spatial correlations between the fluctuations. These can be determined by an electrostatic analogy. A sharp upward pointing conducting wedge in two dimensions or a cone in three is used to determine the functional form of the correlation function Gd(θ). The authors provide an exact prediction for this function and suggest that it can be tested by measuring the number fluctuations in two widely separated boxes.

**Results/Data**

The results are:

1. **Fluctuations**: The paper shows that the giant number fluctuations do not arise from a breakdown of linearized hydrodynamics but rather from long ranged spatial correlations between the fluctuations. These can be determined by an electrostatic analogy. A sharp upward pointing conducting wedge in two dimensions or a cone in three is used to determine the functional form of the correlation function Gd(θ). The authors provide an exact prediction for this function and suggest that it can be tested by measuring the number fluctuations in two widely separated boxes.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The paper does not discuss the following issues:

1. **Equilibrium**: The paper is a theoretical study of non-equilibrium systems, which are characterized by a lack of detailed balance. In particular, the authors consider the case where the total number of particles is conserved but there is no detailed balance between the different species (or "colors") in the system.

2. **Theorems/Proofs**: The paper does not discuss theorems or proofs. It only provides a sketch of the proof for the functional form of Gd(θ) and suggests that it can be tested by measuring the number fluctuations in two widely separated boxes.
