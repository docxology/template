**Overview/Summary**

The COVID-19 pandemic has posed a significant challenge to our understanding of how societies respond to health crises. This paper presents a dynamic causal model (DCM) that explains the dynamics of the outbreak and the subsequent response in 21 countries, including the UK. The DCM is based on the idea that social distancing drives the spread of the virus, while the number of initially infected people determines the timing of the outbreak. The authors argue that this simple model can explain a wide range of phenomena, from the different times at which the outbreaks occurred in each country to the different shapes of the subsequent curves of cases and deaths. They show that the DCM is consistent with data from 21 countries, including the UK.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors present a simple dynamic causal model (DCM) that explains the dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak and the subsequent response in each country. The model is based on the idea that social distancing drives the spread of the virus, while the number of initially infected people determines the timing of the outbreak. They show that the DCM can explain a wide range of phenomena, from the different times at which the outbreaks occurred in each country to the different shapes of the subsequent curves of cases and deaths.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use Bayesian model comparison (BMC) to compare the DCM with alternative models. The BMS is based on the idea that a model with more evidence than another has a higher log Bayes factor or odds ratio, which can be interpreted as an estimate of the relative weight of the two models. The authors argue that the use of BMS licenses them to model the causes of social distancing in terms of a probability that any member of the population is infected. They show that there was overwhelming evidence for infection rates as a primary drive for social distancing, over and above alternative models.

**Results/Data**

The DCM parameters are listed in Table 1. In total, there are 21 DCM parameters. The degree to which a parameter is informed by the data depends upon how changes in the parameter are expressed in data space. For example, increasing the effective population size will uniformly elevate the expected cases per day. Conversely, decreasing the number of initially infected people will delay the curve by shifting it in time. In short, a parameter can be identified if it has a relatively unique expression in the data.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors point out that there is no evidence for or against the DCM. The degree to which a parameter is informed by the data depends upon how changes in the parameter are expressed in data space. For example, increasing the effective population size will uniformly elevate the expected cases per day. Conversely, decreasing the number of initially infected people will delay the curve by shifting it in time. In short, a parameter can be identified if it has a relatively unique expression in the data.
