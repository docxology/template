**Overview/Summary**

The paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the synergies between sector coupling and transmission reinforcement in the European energy system. The authors model the impact of different levels of interconnectivity on the costs and emissions of a 95% CO2 reduction scenario, which is enforced for the sum of the sectors considered in each scenario. They also examine how the synergies change as more demand and flexibility are added from the transport and heating sectors to the model. The authors find that the optimal transmission volume increases with the level of interconnectivity, but the increase is not monotonic. The results suggest that sector coupling can reduce costs for a 95% CO2 reduction by up to 10-20%. They also show that the synergies are more pronounced when the demand and flexibility from the transport sector are added in stages.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors use an energy system model, which is based on the TIMES (Time Use and Energy Demand for Systems Analysis) model. The model includes 31 countries of the European Union, all the sectors that contribute to the final energy consumption, and a number of different technologies. It also accounts for the CO2 emissions from the generation of electricity, land-transport, and heating in the residential and service sectors. The authors find that sector coupling can reduce costs by up to 10-20% for a 95% CO2 reduction. They also show that the synergies are more pronounced when the demand and flexibility from the transport sector are added in stages.

They also show that the synergies are more pronounced when the demand and flexibility from the transport sector are added in stages.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors do not discuss any limitations of their model or results, but they note that the costs for building retrofitting to reduce space heating demand were not optimised directly in the model. Instead, a qualitative analysis is given based on available retrofitting costs for Germany and Denmark. The costs for generating assets are mostly based on predictions for 2030 from DIW [54], with the exception of solar PV, which has been updated with current industry projections [55] given the fast changing costs; the costs of heating sector units are taken from [27, 29, 58].
