**Overview/Summary**

The paper "The state of quantum computing applications in health and medicine" provides a comprehensive overview of the current status of quantum computing (QC) in healthcare and medicine. The authors discuss the potential benefits of QC for various medical applications, including disease diagnosis, treatment planning, drug discovery, and clinical decision-making. They also highlight the challenges that need to be addressed before these potential benefits can be realized.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The paper identifies several key contributions. First, it provides a thorough review of the current state of QC in healthcare and medicine. Second, it highlights the main barriers that must be overcome for QC to have a significant impact on healthcare and medicine. Third, it discusses the potential benefits of QC in various medical applications, including disease diagnosis, treatment planning, drug discovery, and clinical decision-making.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors discuss the current state of QC in healthcare and medicine. They also highlight the main barriers that must be overcome for QC to have a significant impact on healthcare and medicine. The barriers include the lack of high-quality data, the need for large-scale computing resources, the need for more robust software, and the need for better algorithms.

**Results/Data**

The paper does not provide any results or data as it is a review article. However, the authors discuss several key findings. First, they highlight that there are no reported studies of QC in healthcare and medicine. Second, they state that the potential benefits of QC for disease diagnosis, treatment planning, drug discovery, and clinical decision-making have been discussed in various papers. Third, they highlight the main barriers that must be overcome before these potential benefits can be realized.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors discuss several key limitations and future directions. First, they state that there are no reported studies of QC in healthcare and medicine. Second, they state that the potential benefits of QC for disease diagnosis, treatment planning, drug discovery, and clinical decision-making have been discussed in various papers. Third, they highlight the main barriers that must be overcome before these potential benefits can be realized.
