**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Generalised free energy and active inference" by [Authors] (2020) presents a novel perspective on the classic problem of probabilistic inference in graphical models. The authors propose a new perspective based on the concept of generalised free energy, which is an extension of the standard free energy for discrete variables to the case where the variables are continuous. This paper shows that the classical variational free energy and the active inference (AI) can be unified under this framework. In particular, it shows that the two approaches are equivalent in the sense that they can be used interchangeably in the same generative model. The authors also show that the generalised free energy is a function of the approximate posteriors, which provides an alternative to the standard variational inference (VI) and AI. This paper is a first step towards a unified understanding of the two approaches.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this paper are as follows. The authors show that the generalised free energy can be used for both VI and AI, which provides an alternative to the standard variational approach based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. They also show that the generalised free energy is a function of the approximate posteriors, which allows us to use the generalised free energy as an objective function in the same generative model for both VI and AI.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors first introduce the concept of the standard variational free energy. The standard variational free energy is defined as the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between two distributions, which is a non-negative quantity that measures the difference between two probability distributions. In particular, the KL divergence is the expected value of the logarithmic density ratio. The authors also introduce the concept of the generalised free energy, which can be used for both VI and AI. This paper shows that the two approaches are equivalent in the sense that they can be used interchangeably in the same generative model. The authors also show that the generalised free energy is a function of the approximate posteriors, which allows us to use the generalised free energy as an objective function in the same generative model for both VI and AI.

**Results/Data**

The paper provides a number of results and data. In particular, it shows that the two approaches are equivalent in the sense that they can be used interchangeably in the same generative model. It also shows that the generalised free energy is a function of the approximate posteriors, which allows us to use the generalised free energy as an objective function in the same generative model for both VI and AI.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors discuss the limitations of this paper. In particular, they mention that the generalised free energy is not a new approach but rather it provides a unifying perspective on the two approaches. The authors also mention that the generalised free energy can be used as an objective function in the same generative model for both VI and AI. They also discuss some of the future work.

**Limitations/Summary**

The paper does not have any major limitations. It is well-structured, easy to follow, and it provides a number of results and data.
