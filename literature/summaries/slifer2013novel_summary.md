**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Novel Physics With Tensor Polarized Targets" by K. Slifer et al. (2015) discusses the potential of a novel target in nuclear physics experiments at Jefferson Lab. The authors describe the current state of the 12 GeV polarized target program and the plans for its future use. The main focus is on the possibility to increase the polarization of the target by using the "burning holes" method, which was first demonstrated by de Boer (1974) in a solid target. This method allows the simultaneous excitation of two transitions from the three sublevels of the 1st hyperfine state of the 2S+1/2 level to the 3rd and 5th hyperfine states. The authors also mention that there is an alternative possibility for the future target, which would be a device optimized for the next round of experiments. The paper does not contain any new results or original contributions.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contribution of this paper is to demonstrate the potential of using a novel target in nuclear physics experiments at Jefferson Lab. The authors do not present any new data, and there are no new findings or advances in the field. The paper is an overview of the current state of the 12 GeV polarized target program and the plans for its future use.

**Methodology/Approach**

The main methodology of this paper is to describe the techniques used to enhance the polarization of a solid target, which was first demonstrated by de Boer (1974). The authors also mention that there is an alternative possibility for the future target. The paper does not contain any new results or original contributions.

**Results/Data**

The only result presented in this paper is the fact that the existing target underwent significant renovation during the recent E08-027 run, and the superconducting Helmholtz coils quenched catastrophically early in the run. The authors mention that the 12 GeV polarized target program will beneﬁt if this target can be replaced or supplemented with a device optimized for the next round of experiments.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The main limitation of this paper is that it does not present any new results or original contributions in the field. The authors do not discuss any limitations of their work, and there are no suggestions for future work.
