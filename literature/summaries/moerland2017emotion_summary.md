**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Emotion in Reinforcement Learning Agents and Robots: A Survey" by Moerland et al. (2016) provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of research on emotion in reinforcement learning agents and robots. The authors identify three main categories of emotion elicitation methods, which they term "internal", "temporal difference-based", and "reward-based". Internal methods use internal agent/robot aspects to generate emotions; temporal difference-based methods relate emotions to the value or reward function; and reward-based methods are based on the raw reward. The authors then provide a number of examples for each category, with 14 in total, from various disciplines such as psychology, neuroscience, computer science, and robotics.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this paper are to identify and categorize the current state of research on emotion in reinforcement learning agents and robots. The authors also provide a number of examples for each category, with 14 in total, from various disciplines such as psychology, neuroscience, computer science, and robotics.
