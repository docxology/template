**Overview/Summary**

The paper discusses the equivalence between the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Wallas' four-stage creative process. The FEP is a mathematical framework that describes the learning process of the brain, which can be applied to any system that must make predictions about its environment. It is based on the idea that the brain's primary function is to predict sensory data by minimizing surprise or free energy. The paper shows that the four stages of Wallas' creative process (preparation, incubation, illumination, and verification) are simply different phases of the FEP. The first stage of the FEP is the active state where the person is actively engaged in the task at hand, which corresponds to the preparation phase of the creative process. The second stage of the FEP is the internal state where the brain processes sensory data without any conscious control from the person, which is similar to the incubation phase of the creative process. The third and fourth stages of the FEP are the two phases of the verification phase of the creative process, where the person is actively engaged in the task at hand again. The first phase of the verification phase corresponds to the illumination stage, where the brain has found a sensory signal with minimal surprise, but only after being aided by the active state of the brain (i.e., consciousness). The second phase of the verification phase is when the person's new knowledge that was processed in their prior internal state becomes the basis for their new active state. This paper shows that the creative process can be described as a series of phases of active and internal states, which are alternated in the FEP framework.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contribution of this paper is to show the equivalence between the FEP and Wallas' four-stage creative process. The two frameworks have stages that could be mapped into each other. In this respect, the free energy cycle is simply the mathematical counterpart of Wallas' creative process. Thus, creativity is a process that can be described as the alternation of phases of active states (consciousness) and internal states (unconsciousness) which the brain undergoes in its learning process as expounded by the FEP framework. In addition, since creativity follows the free energy principle, it follows that the brain is able to ideate, resolve, or invent when it has reached a Bayesian optimization exercise where it has found a sensory signal that minimizes surprise, and hence entropy.

**Methodology/Approach**

The paper does not describe any methodology. It only discusses the FEP framework and Wallas' four-stage creative process. The FEP is based on the idea that the brain's primary function is to predict sensory data by minimizing surprise or free energy. The paper shows that the four stages of Wallas' creative process are simply different phases of the FEP. The first stage of the FEP is the active state where the person is actively engaged in the task at hand, which corresponds to the preparation phase of the creative process. The second stage of the FEP is the internal state where the brain processes sensory data without any conscious control from the person, which is similar to the incubation phase of the creative process. The third and fourth stages of the FEP are the two phases of the verification phase of the creative process, where the person is actively engaged in the task at hand again. The first phase of the verification phase corresponds to the illumination stage, where the brain has found a sensory signal with minimal surprise, but only after being aided by the active state of the brain (i.e., consciousness). The second phase of the verification phase is when the person's new knowledge that was processed in their prior internal state becomes the basis for their new active state. This paper shows that the creative process can be described as a series of phases of active and internal states, which are alternated in the FEP framework.

**Results/Data**

The results of this paper are mainly theoretical. The main result is to show the equivalence between the FEP and Wallas' four-stage creative process. There are no experimental or data analysis sections in the paper. The paper does not describe any methodology. It only discusses the FEP framework and Wallas' four-stage creative process.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The limitations of this paper are mainly theoretical. The main limitation is that the paper does not discuss the practical applications of the equivalence between the FEP and Wallas' four-stage creative process. The paper shows that the two frameworks have stages that could be mapped into each other, but it does not describe how these two frameworks can be applied in practice. In addition, since creativity follows the free energy principle, it follows that the brain is able to ideate, resolve, or invent when it has reached a Bayesian optimization exercise where it has found a sensory signal that minimizes surprise, and hence entropy.
