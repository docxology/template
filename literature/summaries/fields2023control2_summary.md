**Overview/Summary**

The paper by Fields et al. (2022) is a theoretical work on the topic of control flow in active inference systems. The authors propose that the brain can be understood as an active inference system, which is a statistical model for how it processes sensory data to make predictions about the world. In this context, the process of making these predictions is called "perception" and the process of acting upon the world based on those predictions is called "action". The authors argue that the brain's processing costs are minimized when it makes its best prediction given the available information and the cost of processing that information. This is the free energy principle, which has been applied to many different domains in the past, including physics, biology, computer science, and mathematics. In this paper, the authors consider the problem of how the brain's control flow arises from the process of making these predictions. The authors provide three formal representations for the problem of defining control flow: first as a dynamical system, second as a set of deployed quantum field theories (QFTs), and third as a computational process represented by a topological network (TN). The authors argue that the brain's processing costs are minimized when it makes its best prediction given the available information.
