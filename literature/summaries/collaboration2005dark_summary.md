**The Dark Energy Survey**

**Overview/Summary**
The Dark Energy Survey (DES) is a comprehensive and systematic study of the properties of dark energy, which is the driving force behind the accelerating expansion of the universe. The DES collaboration will conduct a five-year survey using the 4-meter Blanco telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile to probe the nature of dark energy. This paper describes the science goals and methodology for the DES. The DES will use a wide-area, multi-filter imaging camera (DECam) to observe the sky over 4000 square degrees with five filters that are sensitive from 3000 to 10000 Angstroms. The DECam is a new instrument designed by the DES collaboration. It has a 2.5 degree field of view and will be able to see objects as faint as 24th magnitude in the g band (Vega). The DES will also use an automated telescope system, which will allow for efficient follow-up observations with existing telescopes. The survey will start in 2009 and will continue until 2014. 

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The main goal of the DES is to measure the equation of state of dark energy as a function of redshift. This will be done by measuring the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) in the power spectrum of the galaxy distribution, which are sensitive to the expansion history and the growth rate of the universe. The BAOs can be used to constrain the properties of the dark energy. The DES will also measure the redshift evolution of the distance scale, the equation of state, and the number density of massive neutrinos. In addition, the survey will provide a large sample of galaxy clusters and superclusters that are sensitive to the growth rate of the universe. The DES will be able to detect the BAOs in the power spectrum with an accuracy that is comparable to or better than the Planck satellite mission. 

**Methodology/Approach**
The DES will use a wide-area, multi-filter imaging camera (DECam) to observe the sky over 4000 square degrees with five filters that are sensitive from 3000 to 10000 Angstroms. The DECam is a new instrument designed by the DES collaboration. It has a 2.5 degree field of view and will be able to see objects as faint as 24th magnitude in the g band (Vega). The DES will also use an automated telescope system, which will allow for efficient follow-up observations with existing telescopes. The survey will start in 2009 and will continue until 2014. 

**Results/Data**
The predicted SZE 5σ cluster mass limit and abundance above that limit as a function of redshift is shown in Figure 2.1 for the fiducial cosmology. In this analysis, the effects of point sources, both infrared galaxies and radio AGN, are not included, although White and Majumdar (2004) have shown how to do this for a single frequency instrument. SPT will have three frequency channels and can address point source confusion by applying the spectra of the point sources and hence cleaning the map. Here we have addressed this issue qualitatively by using a 5σ (rather than lower) detection threshold for SPT. The predicted SZE cluster mass limit and cluster abundance as a function of redshift is shown in Figure 2.1 for the fiducial cosmology. 

**Limitations/Discussion**
The DES will be able to detect the BAOs in the power spectrum with an accuracy that is comparable to or better than the Planck satellite mission. To approach that precision, we need to understand the sources and expected levels of systematic error and develop methods to control them to the extent possible. We will present an inventory of the systematic errors by stepping through the program.
