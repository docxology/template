**Overview/Summary**

The paper presents a theoretical analysis of the effective medium theory for electromagnetic and quantum systems with dispersive media. The authors consider the case where the permittivity is described by a Drude model and the dispersion relation is given by the Lorentzian formula. They show that the effective medium theory can be used to describe the behavior of the electromagnetic field in the presence of a dispersive material, which is characterized by the frequency-dependent dielectric constant. The authors also consider the case where the dispersion relation is linear, and they find that the zero- gap regime occurs when the volume fraction of the HgTe circular scattering centers satisfies 0/1VVff = 0.247.
