**Overview/Summary**

This paper proposes a novel approach to active preference inference using language models and probabilistic graphical models. The authors first introduce the concept of preference inference in the context of customer service, where an agent (e.g., salesperson) can ask questions about the product that a user is interested in to determine which one among multiple options they prefer most. They then present a novel approach called ReAct, which uses a probabilistic graphical model to represent the user's preferences and perform active preference inference. The authors also introduce an algorithm for learning the parameters of this model from a set of demonstrations, where each demonstration is a sequence of questions asked by the agent and the corresponding answers provided by the user. Finally, they show that ReAct outperforms a vanilla baseline in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The key contributions of this paper are as follows:
1. The authors introduce a probabilistic graphical model to represent the user's preferences based on the questions asked by the agent and the answers provided by the user.
2. They propose an algorithm for learning the parameters of the probabilistic graphical model from a set of demonstrations, where each demonstration is a sequence of questions asked by the agent and the corresponding answers provided by the user.

**Results/Data**

The results show that ReAct outperforms a vanilla baseline in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. The paper does not provide any specific data or statistics for the performance comparison between ReAct and the vanilla baseline, but it provides an example run to illustrate how the algorithm works.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors do not discuss the limitations of their work, but they do mention that this is a first step towards solving the problem. They also suggest several future research directions for this topic.
