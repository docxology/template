**Title:** On principles of inductive inference
**Authors:** R.

The paper "On principles of inductive inference" by R. is a comprehensive and well-structured survey of the foundations of statistical inference. The authors discuss the main principles that underlie the use of statistical methods to make inferences about the world, how they have been formulated over time, and their implications for the way we think about data analysis. They argue that the most important principle is that of maximum entropy (ME) or minimum cross-entropy (MCE), which provides a framework for making inferences from incomplete information. The authors also discuss the historical development of statistical inference, the role of the ME/MCE principle in the foundations of statistics and its relationship to the other principles.

**Overview/Summary:** This paper is an overview of the main principles that underlie the use of statistical methods to make inferences about the world. It discusses how these principles have been formulated over time and their implications for the way we think about data analysis. The authors argue that the most important principle is that of maximum entropy (ME) or minimum cross-entropy (MCE), which provides a framework for making inferences from incomplete information. The authors also discuss the historical development of statistical inference, the role of the ME/MCE principle in the foundations of statistics and its relationship to the other principles.
