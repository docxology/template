**Overview/Summary**

The intermittent use of a sensor is a common problem in many real-world applications. For example, when a frigate searches for an alerted target, the frigate can either be on active alert (on) or off (not on). The time spent being on and not on is called the passive period. This paper presents a simple model for the intermittent use of a sensor. The model is based on the idea that during the passive period, the probability of detection is zero. During the active period, the probability of detection is equal to the probability of the target being in the frigate's searchlight. The resulting effect of the intermittent sensor use is an average detection width which is proportional to the probability of detection but has an operational significance on its own. The model can be used for the design of a strategy for the intermittent use of a sensor.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors present a simple model for the intermittent use of a sensor. They show that the resulting effect of the intermittent sensor use is an average detection width which is proportional to the probability of detection but has an operational significance on its own. The model can be used for the design of a strategy for the intermittent use of a sensor.
