Overview/Summary:
The paper presents a novel approach for anomaly detection in multihypothesis testing with controlled sensing. The authors propose an entropy-based objective function and implement the active inference algorithm using deep learning. In this problem setting, the goal is to detect all anomalies while minimizing the delay and total cost of sensing. The sequential design of experiments is used as a baseline method. This paper also compares the proposed algorithm with the actor-critic reinforcement learning based approach in terms of the success rate, stopping time, and total cost of sensing.

Key Contributions/Findings:
The authors propose an entropy-based objective function for the active inference algorithm. They use this new objective to implement the deep active inference algorithm and compare it with the actor-critic method. The results show that the proposed algorithm can detect all anomalies quicker than the actor-critic algorithm while achieving a similar cost of sensing. This is because the average number of processes selected by the proposed algorithm does not vary much with the change in the objective function, whereas the average number of processes selected by the actor-critic algorithm increases as the objective function changes.

Methodology/Approach:
The authors first present the problem of anomaly detection under controlled sensing using a deep learning based approach. They then propose an entropy-based objective function for this active inference problem and implement the deep active inference algorithm. The results are compared with those from the actor-critic method in terms of the success rate, stopping time, and total cost of sensing.

Results/Data:
The authors compare the proposed algorithm with the actor-critic method in terms of the success rate, stopping time, and total cost of sensing. The results show that the proposed algorithm can detect all anomalies quicker than the actor-critic algorithm while achieving a similar cost of sensing. This is because the average number of processes selected by the proposed algorithm does not vary much with the change in the objective function, whereas the average number of processes selected by the actor-critic algorithm increases as the objective function changes.

Limitations/Discussion:
The authors do not discuss any limitations or future work in their paper.
