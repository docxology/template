**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Effective immunity and second waves: a dynamic causal modelling study" by Moran et al. (2020) uses dynamic causal models to investigate the relationship between the effectiveness of the immune response and the likelihood of a second wave of COVID-19 infections in seven European countries, including the UK and Ireland. The authors use data from the first 10 months of the pandemic to estimate the number of susceptible individuals that would need to be 'locked down' for a given time period (the required 'lockdown') before immunity is reached. They also investigate how the size of this required lockdown varies across different countries, and whether it is affected by the level of social distancing measures in place.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main findings from this study are that the required lockdown for a second wave of COVID-19 infections is lower than previously suggested. The authors find that if the effectiveness of the immune response is high enough (i.e., above 0.8), then the required lockdown before immunity is reached is less than 6 months, and in some cases it may be as low as 3 months. They also find that this required lockdown is not affected by the level of social distancing measures in place.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use dynamic causal models to estimate the number of susceptible individuals that would need to be 'locked down' for a given time period before immunity is reached, and they compare their results with previous estimates. The data used comes from the first 10 months of the pandemic, and it includes information on the number of reported cases of COVID-19 in each country, as well as the level of social distancing measures that were in place at different times during this period.

**Results/Data**

The authors find that if the effectiveness of the immune response is high enough (i.e., above 0.8), then the required lockdown before immunity is reached is less than 6 months, and in some cases it may be as low as 3 months. They also find that this required lockdown is not affected by the level of social distancing measures in place.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors note that their results are based on a number of assumptions about the immune response to COVID-19. The first assumption is that there is no immunity at all until the 'required lockdown' time point, and the second is that this required lockdown is sufficient for the population to reach herd immunity. They also assume that the effectiveness of the immune response is constant over time. However, they note that these assumptions are not necessarily realistic, as it may take some time for the immune system to develop a full response after infection, and the effectiveness of the immune response may vary across different individuals. The authors suggest that if the required lockdown is lower than 6 months, then this could be due to the fact that there is already immunity in the population at the start of the pandemic, or that the effectiveness of the immune response is higher than they have assumed.
