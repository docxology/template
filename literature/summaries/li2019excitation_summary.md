**Overview/Summary**

The excitation functions of various parameters are investigated for a wide range of particle species in high-energy collisions at different center-of-mass energies. The paper is organized into the following parts. In the first part, the authors compare the transverse momentum (pT) spectra of pions, kaons and protons produced in INEL pp collisions at mid-rapidity or mid-pseudorapidity for various center-of-mass energies from 10 GeV to 13 TeV. The excitation functions are defined as the inverse slopes of the transverse momentum (pT) spectra. In the second part, the authors compare the temperature and the ratio of the thermal velocity to the speed of light (β) for pions, kaons and protons in INEL pp collisions at mid-rapidity or mid-pseudorapidity for various center-of-mass energies from 10 GeV to 13 TeV. The excitation functions are defined as the inverse slopes of the transverse momentum (pT) spectra. In the third part, the authors compare the temperature and the ratio of the thermal velocity to the speed of light (β) for pions, kaons and protons in INEL pp collisions at mid-rapidity or mid-pseudorapidity for various center-of-mass energies from 10 GeV to 13 TeV. The excitation functions are defined as the inverse slopes of the transverse momentum (pT) spectra.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main findings of this paper can be summarized in three parts.

**Methodology/Approach**

In the first part, the authors compare the pT spectra of π+, K+ and p for 10 GeV to 13 TeV. The inverse slope (pT) is extracted from the transverse momentum (pT) spectra by a single-component fit in some cases. In other cases, the simultaneous two-component fit is used. However, the simultaneous fit seeks for the same temperature which does not allow the two-temperature for some particles due to other particles corresponding to one component. The authors are not inclined to fit simultaneously the pT spectra of different particles. Conversely, they use different T for different spectra in this paper. One can see that the same set of  is not ideal. These results do not support the single scenario for kinetic freeze-out. They are not inclined to fit simultaneously the pT spectra of diﬀerent particles. Conversely, they use different  for diﬀerent pT spectra in this paper. The inverse slope (pT) is extracted from the transverse momentum (pT) spectra by a single-component fit in some cases. In other cases, the simultaneous two-component fit is used. However, the simultaneous fit seeks for the same temperature which does not allow the two-temperature for some particles due to other particles corresponding to one component.
