**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Dust in Active Galactic Nuclei" by A. Li and B.T. Draine (2001) is a review of the current understanding of dust in active galactic nuclei (AGN). The authors discuss the observational evidence for the presence of dust in AGN, the physical properties of the dust, and the role that it plays in the AGN phenomenon. They also present the results from their own work on the infrared (IR) spectral energy distribution (SED) of a sample of 14 active galactic nuclei (AGN). The paper is organized as follows: an overview of the current state of knowledge about dust in AGN, the physical properties of the dust, and the results from the authors' SED study. The overview section provides a summary of what is currently known about dust in AGN. The authors discuss the observational evidence for the presence of dust in AGN and the role that it plays in the AGN phenomenon. This includes the IR SEDs of the 14 objects, the properties of the dust, and the results from their own study.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this paper are the following: (1) The authors present a comprehensive review of the current state of knowledge about dust in AGN. This includes the observational evidence for the presence of dust in AGN, the physical properties of the dust, and the role that it plays in the AGN phenomenon. They also present the results from their own study on the IR SEDs of 14 active galactic nuclei (AGN). The authors' study is based on a sample of 14 objects with known redshifts, which are selected to have a broad range of luminosities and a relatively narrow range of black hole masses. They find that the mid-IR SED can be well fit by a single power law, but the far-IR SED is better fit by two powers. The authors also find that the 12 micron/60 micron ratio is not correlated with the 1.4 GHz radio luminosity and the 5 GHz radio luminosity. They suggest that the mid-IR SEDs are dominated by a single component, while the far-IR SEDs are dominated by two components. The authors also find that the dust in AGN has a very high emissivity (Q), which is similar to the value for the interstellar medium (ISM) of our Galaxy.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors' study uses a sample of 14 active galactic nuclei (AGN). These objects are selected from the literature and have known redshifts. The selection criteria include that the object has a broad range of luminosities, but a relatively narrow range of black hole masses. This is to ensure that the AGN are in the same evolutionary state. The authors use the 12 micron/60 micron ratio as a measure of the dust temperature and the 1.4 GHz radio luminosity and the 5 GHz radio luminosity as measures of the bolometric luminosity. They find that the mid-IR SEDs can be well fit by a single power law, but the far-IR SED is better fit by two powers. The authors also find that the 12 micron/60 micron ratio is not correlated with the 1.4 GHz radio luminosity and the 5 GHz radio luminosity. The authors suggest that the mid-IR SEDs are dominated by a single component, while the far-IR SEDs are dominated by two components. The authors also find that the dust in AGN has a very high emissivity (Q), which is similar to the value for the interstellar medium (ISM) of our Galaxy.

**Results/Data**

The data from this paper includes the 12 micron/60 micron ratio, the 1.4 GHz radio luminosity, and the 5 GHz radio luminosity. The authors find that the mid-IR SEDs can be well fit by a single power law. The authors also find that the far-IR SED is better fit by two powers. The authors suggest that the mid-IR SEDs are dominated by a single component, while the far-IR SEDs are dominated by two components. The authors also find that the dust in AGN has a very high emissivity (Q), which is similar to the value for the interstellar medium (ISM) of our Galaxy.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The main limitations of this paper are the following: (1) The sample size is small, and the selection criteria may not be ideal. The authors suggest that their study would benefit from a larger sample. They also note that the 12 micron/60 micron ratio is not correlated with the 1.4 GHz radio luminosity and the 5 GHz radio luminosity. This suggests that there are other factors that affect the dust temperature, such as the amount of gas in the AGN. The authors suggest that their study would benefit from a larger sample.
