Title: OpportunityFinder: A Framework for Automated Causal Inference Conference acronym 󠁧󠁧󠁧󠁧󠁧󠁧󠁧󠁧󠁧󠁧󠁧󠁧󠁧󠁧󠁧󠁧󠁧󠁧󠁧󠁧

Abstract: We present OpportunityFinder (OPF), a framework for automated causal inference that can be used to analyze any observational data. The core of OPF is a flexible, modular system that allows users to specify the types of analyses they wish to perform and the methods they wish to use to perform them. This flexibility makes it easy to compare different approaches and to combine multiple approaches in order to find the best one for their specific problem. To demonstrate this, we have implemented OPF using a variety of causal inference algorithms that can be used with any observational data. We also provide a set of validation tests that can be applied to any treatment effect estimate. In addition to these general tools, we have developed a number of domain-specific tools and datasets for the analysis of crime, health, education, and employment. These tools are designed to support the work of researchers in their respective fields.
