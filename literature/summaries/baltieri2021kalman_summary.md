**Overview/Summary**
The paper presents a review of Kalman filters and their application to estimation and control in various fields. The authors argue that the Kalman filter is not only a powerful tool for state estimation but also a natural gradient descent in trajectory space, which provides an intuitive explanation for the learning process in neural networks. They provide a unified view on the Kalman filter as the steady-state solution of the optimization problem and discuss its application to both estimation and control problems. The paper starts with a brief introduction to the Kalman filter and its relation to the prediction error. Then it reviews the Kalman filter from the perspective of the gradient descent in trajectory space, which provides an intuitive explanation for the learning process in neural networks. Next, it discusses the relation between the Kalman filter and the optimization problem, and then it presents a unified view on the Kalman filter as the steady-state solution of the optimization problem. Finally, it concludes with some discussions on the application to both estimation and control problems.
