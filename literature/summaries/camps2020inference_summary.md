**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Inference of ventricular activation properties from non-ventricular activation" by Britton et al. (2020) is a research article that presents an approach to infer the properties of the ventricular activation sequence in the human heart using electrocardiograms (ECGs). The authors use a novel method based on the simulation of the ECGs and the analysis of the variability in the QRS complex, which is the part of the ECG that is most affected by the ventricular activity. This approach can be used to understand the variability in the activation sequence between different individuals and also to identify the changes in the activation sequence due to a disease or an intervention. The paper is organized as follows: **Overview/Summary** (what the paper is about), **Key Contributions/Findings** (main results and advances), **Methodology/Approach** (how the research was conducted), **Results/Data** (what was found or measured), and **Limitations/Discussion** (weaknesses and future work). The authors use a population of 1000 models to predict the ECGs for different individuals. This is done by using a coarse biventricular- torso mesh, which is obtained from the segmentation of the cardiac MRI images. The authors also use a k-means based strategy to combine the predicted data and obtain the final result. The results show that the method can be used to predict the ECGs for different individuals with high accuracy. Additionally, the paper shows that the method's ability to infer the conduction speeds is dependent on its ability to estimate the number of the ventricular activation sites.

Additionally, the paper shows that the method's ability to infer the conduction speeds is dependent on its ability to estimate the number of the ventricular activation sites. As future work, the authors encourage that their methods are validated using clinical recordings and also noisy data inputs as in Grandits et al. (2020).
