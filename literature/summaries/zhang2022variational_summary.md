**Overview/Summary**

The paper presents a novel approach to joint user activity detection and channel estimation for grant-free non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems. The authors propose a variational Bayesian inference (VBI) based clustering method that can be used in the uplink of NOMA, which is an important problem in 5G networks. In this paper, the authors first introduce the VBI framework for the joint user activity detection and channel estimation problem. Then they use the VBI to solve a sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) based model, where the SBL model can be used for the grant-free NOMA system. The SBL model is a widely used method in the literature of the joint user activity detection and channel estimation. In this paper, the authors first introduce the VBI framework for the joint user activity detection and channel estimation problem. Then they use the VBI to solve an SBL based model, where the SBL model can be used for the grant-free NOMA system. The SBL model is a widely used method in the literature of the joint user activity detection and channel estimation.
