**Overview/Summary**

The paper presents a new approach to recursive Bayesian inference using Rényi information measures. The authors propose an active recursive Bayesian estimation (ARBE) framework that is based on the Rényi divergence and its associated multi-armed bandit problem. In this framework, at each time step, the system chooses the next measurement based on the current state of the system and the history of previous measurements. The goal is to minimize the expected value of a loss function which depends on the difference between the true state and the estimate. The authors first show that the optimal policy for the ARBE problem is the same as the one for the multi-armed bandit problem, and then provide an algorithm based on the upper confidence bound (UCB) strategy. The UCB strategy can be used to solve the ARBE problem in a distributed manner. The paper also provides some numerical results that show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this work are as follows:
- A new framework for recursive Bayesian estimation based on Rényi information measures is presented.
- An algorithm based on the UCB strategy is provided to solve the ARBE problem in a distributed manner. The authors also provide some numerical results that show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

**Methodology/Approach**

The paper first shows that the optimal policy for the ARBE problem is the same as the one for the multi-armed bandit problem, and then provides an algorithm based on the UCB strategy. The UCB strategy can be used to solve the ARBE problem in a distributed manner.

**Results/Data**

Some numerical results are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The paper does not discuss any limitations or future work, but it is important for readers to realize that this is an early stage research and there may be many open questions. For example, how to select the parameters in the UCB strategy? How to deal with the case where the loss function is nonconvex?
