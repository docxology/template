**Overview/Summary**
The paper "Understanding Tool Discovery and Tool Innovation Using Active Inference" by Parr, Friston, and Ball (2022) is a theoretical study that aims to provide an understanding of the distinction between tool discovery and tool innovation in the context of active inference. The authors use this formalism to explore a simple model of tool innovation in an artificial agent. They introduce a factorisation of hidden states of the generative model into affordances, which affords the agent with the ability to generalise what it has learned about state transitions and conceptualise a suitable tool via a process of induction. The authors discuss the implications and limitations of their results and outline directions for further research.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The main contributions of this work are:
1) A formalism, based on Gibson's affordances (1977), is introduced to describe the distinction between tool discovery and tool innovation under active inference.
2) The authors use this formalism to explore a simple model of tool innovation in an artificial agent by introducing a factorisation of hidden states of the generative model into affordances. This particular structural choice affords the agent with the ability to generalise what it has learned about state transitions and conceptualise a suitable tool via a process of induction.
3) The authors discuss the implications and limitations of their results and outline directions for further research.

**Methodology/Approach**
The authors use the active inference formalism (Friston, 2012; Friston et al., 2017) to explore this model. They introduce a factorisation of hidden states of the generative model into affordances. This particular structural choice affords the agent with the ability to generalise what it has learned about state transitions and conceptualise a suitable tool via a process of induction.

**Results/Data**
The authors do not provide any specific results or data in this paper, as they are exploring an abstract formalism for understanding tool discovery and innovation. The results that they discuss are based on the implications and limitations of their work rather than any concrete findings from experiments or simulations.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The main limitation of this work is the lack of concrete results from experiments or simulations. This is because the authors are not providing a new model, but instead using active inference to explore what they already know about tool discovery and innovation (based on Gibson's affordances). The authors also do not provide any specific data that could be used for comparison with other models. However, this work does not have any specific weaknesses or limitations in terms of the methodology or approach.
