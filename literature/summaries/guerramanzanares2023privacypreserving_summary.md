Title: Privacy-protecting machine learning for healthcare: open-source solutions

Abstract: The increasing adoption of machine learning in the health care sector is driven by its potential to improve patient outcomes and reduce costs, but it also poses a risk that sensitive patient data may be compromised. This paper proposes a privacy-preserving machine learning system for the health care sector based on homomorphic encryption (HE) and secure multi-party computation (SMC). The proposed system can protect the privacy of patients in the health care sector while ensuring the accuracy of the diagnosis results. It is also open-source, which means that it can be used by any one who wants to use this technology for free.

The main contribution of this paper is a new secure multi-party computation (SMC) protocol based on homomorphic encryption (HE), and a new privacy-preserving machine learning system for the health care sector. The proposed SMC protocol is more efficient than the existing protocols in terms of communication complexity, which can be used to build the privacy-preserving machine learning system for the health care sector.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we give an overview of the related work. In Section 3, we describe the proposed SMC protocol and the new privacy-preserving machine learning system based on HE and SMC. The results are given in Section 4. Finally, the conclusions are drawn in Section 5.

Overview/Summary
The paper proposes an open-source privacy-preserving machine learning (ML) system for healthcare that is based on homomorphic encryption (HE) and secure multi-party computation (SMC). The proposed SMC protocol can be used to build the privacy-preserving ML system. The main contribution of this paper is a new SMC protocol, which is more efficient than the existing protocols in terms of communication complexity.

Key Contributions/Findings
The key contributions of this paper are the new SMC protocol and the new privacy-protecting ML system based on HE and SMC. The proposed SMC protocol can be used to build the privacy-preserving ML system for healthcare that is more efficient than the existing protocols in terms of communication complexity.

Methodology/Approach
The methodology of this paper is to design a new SMC protocol, which is based on HE. In this protocol, the data owner and the data user are both honest. The proposed SMC protocol can be used to build the privacy-preserving ML system for healthcare that ensures the accuracy of the diagnosis results while protecting the privacy of patients.

Results/Data
The paper also proposes a new privacy-protecting ML system based on HE and SMC. This system is open-source, which means that it can be used by any one who wants to use this technology for free. The proposed SMC protocol is more efficient than the existing protocols in terms of communication complexity.

Limitations/Discussion
The main limitation of this paper is that the data owner and the data user are both honest. This assumption may not always hold in real-world applications, which means that the system needs to be further improved. The proposed SMC protocol can only be used for the existing protocols based on HE. It cannot be directly applied to other protocols.
