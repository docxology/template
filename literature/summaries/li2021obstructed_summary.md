**Overview/Summary**
The present study is focused on the development of a new class of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), namely FeP4 and RuP4, which are found to be topologically nontrivial insulators with an obstructed surface state. The authors demonstrate that these 2D TMDs can catalyze the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in a similar manner as the state-of-the-art Pt-based catalysts. The HER activity of the two OAI MoS2, FeP4, and FeS2 is compared with those of normal insulators Fe2O3 and FeS. The results indicate that the 2D TMDs are promising candidates for low-cost and high-efficiency electrocatalysts.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The authors first synthesize the two OAI MoS2, FeP4, and FeS2 by a facile solvothermal method. The crystal structures of these materials are confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. The morphology and composition of the as-synthesized products are characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The catalytic activities of the two OAI MoS2, FeP4, and FeS2 for HER in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1 M KOH electrolytes are investigated by a three-electrode system. The results show that the 2D TMDs exhibit similar or even better catalytic activities than the state-of-the-art Pt-based catalysts. The double-layer capacitance (Cdl) of the RuP4 in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1 M KOH electrolytes is measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The overpotential for 95% current density is obtained from the Tafel plot, which indicates that the HER takes place through the Volmer-Tafel mechanism and the recombination step is the rate-determining step for both Pt and RuP4. The Cdl of the RuP4 in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1 M KOH electrolytes is measured by CV, which indicates that the HER activity of the catalysts is dependent on the concentration of the electrolyte. The TOF of the RuP4 in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1 M KOH electrolytes is obtained from the Tafel plot, which indicates that the HER takes place through the Volmer-Tafel mechanism and the recombination step is the rate-determining step for both Pt and RuP4. The stability of the RuP4 in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1 M KOH electrolytes is investigated by a constant overpotential test, which indicates that the catalysts are stable after an operation time of 6 h.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The authors find that the two OAI MoS2, FeP4, and FeS2 have similar or even better catalytic activities than the state-of-the-art Pt-based catalysts. The 2D TMDs are promising candidates for low-cost and high-efficiency electrocatalysts. However, the specific areas of the investigated catalysts are not provided in this paper. Therefore, the authors do not consider the specific areas of the catalysts. The stability test of the RuP4 nanostructured catalyst at a constant overpotential of 70 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte (without iR correction) is only performed for 6 h. The long-term operation time and the effects of different electrolytes on the catalytic activities are not discussed in this paper.
