Here is a summary of the scientific research paper:

**Overview/Summary**

The present study investigated the therapeutic effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The authors used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to measure changes in cerebral interoceptive function. Interoception is the ability to sense the physiological state of one's own body, and it is thought to play a role in the development and maintenance of PTSD symptoms. MBSR is a form of mindfulness meditation that has been shown to be effective for reducing stress-related symptoms in healthy individuals and those with anxiety disorders.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The study found that the therapeutic effects of MBSR are based on the improvement of cerebral interoceptive function, particularly the increase in the frontal theta heart rate variability (HRV) response. The authors used a within-subjects design to compare the changes in fNIRS signal before and after an 8-week MBSR program. The results showed that the MBSR group had a significant increase in the frontal theta HRV response, which was not seen in the control group. This study is the first to use fNIRS to measure the therapeutic effects of MBSR on PTSD symptoms.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors recruited 38 participants with current or past PTSD and randomly assigned them to either an 8-week MBSR program (n=19) or a wait-list control condition. The participants were assessed before and after the intervention, and the fNIRS signal was recorded at rest in the morning and evening for 5 days each week during the last 4 weeks of the study. The authors used a between-subjects design to compare the changes in the two groups.

**Results/Data**

The results showed that the MBSR group had a significant increase in the frontal theta HRV response, which was not seen in the control group. This study is the first to use fNIRS to measure the therapeutic effects of MBSR on PTSD symptoms. The authors found that the improvement in the re-experiencing symptom subscale of the PTSD Checklist (PCL) was significantly correlated with the increase in the frontal theta HRV response. The results also showed that the improvements in all three subscales of the PCL were significantly correlated with the increase in the HRV response.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The study had some limitations, such as the limited number of daily treatment adherence measurements and the limited spatial resolution of the present source localization method. The authors could not rule out that some confounding factors not included in the mediation analyses might partially influence the results. However, the fNIRS signal was not different between pre- and post-intervention or between the two groups. Therefore, the HEBR changes were not driven by ECG parameters and artifacts.

**Translational and Clinical Implications/Caveats**

The study found that MBSR had a significant causal mediation effect on PTSD symptoms through improvements in interoceptive brain function. The authors suggested that the efficacy of mindfulness meditation to regulate autonomic nervous system (ANS) and improve ANS-central nervous system (CNS) interactions might primarily originate from practicing the present-moment attention to internal bodily sensations that enhance interoceptive brain function, which appears to be the essential therapeutic mechanism of MBSR. This implies the possibility of optimizing the current practices of meditative interventions for various stress-related mental disorders by maximizing the efficacy to improve the cerebral interoceptive mechanism.
