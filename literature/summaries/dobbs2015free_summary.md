**Overview/Summary**

The authors study the free energy and equilibrium states for a family of interval maps. The main results are the following.
1. For any unimodal map f with critical order at least 2, there is a unique equilibrium state for the potential ϕ(x) = -log |Df(x)|. This is shown by first proving that the free energy function F(α) is nondecreasing and then showing that this implies the existence of an equilibrium state.
2. For any family {ft}t∈[0,θ)} of unimodal maps with critical order at least 2, there is a unique equilibrium state for the potential ϕf(x) = -log |Df(t,x)|. This is shown by first proving that the free energy function F(α) is nondecreasing and then showing that this implies the existence of an equilibrium state.
3. The authors also study the stability of the family {ft}t∈[0,θ)} of unimodal maps with critical order at least 2. They show that if the topological entropy of ft is not locally constant at t= 0, then there is a sequence tk → 0 for which each ftk is a non-renomalizable Misiurewicz map with acip μk and for which the measures μk converge to the equidistribution on the orbit of p. This immediately implies Theorem 1.11.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors show that if the topological entropy of ft is not locally constant at t= 0, then there is a sequence tk → 0 for which each ftk is a non-renormalizable Misiurewicz map with acip μk and for which the measures μk converge to the equidistribution on the orbit of p. This immediately implies Theorem 1.11.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use a combination of techniques from the theory of dynamical systems, including topological entropy, Misiurewicz's renormalization scheme and the theory of equilibrium states for interval maps. They also use some facts about quadratic interval maps that are well known in the literature.

**Results/Data**

The authors show that if the topological entropy of ft is not locally constant at t= 0, then there is a sequence tk → 0 for which each ftk is a non-renormalizable Misiurewicz map with acip μk and for which the measures μk converge to the equidistribution on the orbit of p. This immediately implies Theorem 1.11.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors show that if the topological entropy of ft is not locally constant at t= 0, then there is a sequence tk → 0 for which each ftk is a non-renormalizable Misiurewicz map with acip μk and for which the measures μk converge to the equidistribution on the orbit of p. This immediately implies Theorem 1.11.
