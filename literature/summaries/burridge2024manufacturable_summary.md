**Overview/Summary**

The paper "A manufacturable platform for photonic quantum computing" by PsiQuantum (2023) presents a new approach to the development of scalable and practical photonic quantum computers. The authors introduce a modular, flexible, and highly efficient architecture that can be used as a starting point for building large-scale photonic quantum computers. The proposed architecture is based on a 2D photonic time-domain platform with a high degree of parallelism, which enables the implementation of a wide range of quantum algorithms in a single device. This modular design also allows for the integration of different components and the use of various materials that can be used to achieve better performance. The authors demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by implementing a 2D photonic time-domain platform with a high degree of parallelism, which is based on a 3D printed optical waveguide circuit. The proposed architecture has the potential for large-scale integration and can be used as a starting point for building a large-scale photonic quantum computer.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The key contributions of this work are the design and demonstration of an efficient and highly parallel 2D photonic time-domain platform, which is based on a 3D printed optical waveguide circuit. The authors also demonstrate the feasibility of using different materials in the same device to achieve better performance. The proposed architecture has the potential for large-scale integration and can be used as a starting point for building a large-scale photonic quantum computer.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use a 3D printed optical waveguide circuit to implement an efficient and highly parallel 2D photonic time-domain platform. The 3D printed optical waveguides are made of silicon nitride (Si3N4) and the device is fabricated in a single step. The proposed architecture has a high degree of parallelism, which enables the implementation of a wide range of quantum algorithms in a single device. This modular design also allows for the integration of different components and the use of various materials that can be used to achieve better performance.

**Results/Data**

The authors demonstrate the feasibility of using different materials in the same device to achieve better performance. The proposed architecture has the potential for large-scale integration and can be used as a starting point for building a large-scale photonic quantum computer. The authors also show that the 2D photonic time-domain platform with a high degree of parallelism is highly efficient, which enables the implementation of a wide range of quantum algorithms in a single device.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The main limitation of this work is that the proposed architecture is only demonstrated at the small scale. The authors also suggest some future research directions for large-scale integration and practical applications. The 2D photonic time-domain platform with a high degree of parallelism is highly efficient, which enables the implementation of a wide range of quantum algorithms in a single device. The authors also show that the proposed architecture has the potential to be used as a starting point for building a large-scale photonic quantum computer.
