**Overview/Summary**

The study of low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions (LINERs) has been an active field for 25 years since their discovery. The Spitzer Space Telescope recently made possible very sensitive observations of the mid-infrared fine-structure emission lines in these objects, which are used to determine the physical conditions and chemical composition of the gas. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the high- and low-ionization line properties of LINERs based on the Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) spectra of 25 LINERs.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main findings of this study are that: (1) The mid-infrared high-ionization lines are consistent with a very high AGN fraction. (2) The LINERs have excess low-ionization line emission, especially in the PDR and XDR tracers [Fe II] 26.0 μm and [Si II] 34.8 μm. (3) There is a significant difference between IR-luminous and IR-faint LINERs in their mid-infrared properties.

**Methodology/Approach**

The IRS spectra of the 25 LINERs were analyzed to determine the physical conditions and chemical composition of the gas. The [Fe II] 26 μm and [Si II] 34.8 μm line ratios are used as a diagnostic tool for PDR and XDR models, respectively.

**Results/Data**

The mid-infrared high-ionization lines are consistent with a very high AGN fraction. The [Fe II] 26 μm and [Si II] 34.8 μm line ratios of the LINERs are compared to those in starburst galaxies and PNe. The [Fe II] 26 μm and [Si II] 34.8 μm line ratios of the LINERs are found to be different from those in the other two types of objects, especially for IR-faint LINERs. The [Fe II] 26 μm and [Si II] 34.8 μm line ratios of the LINERs are compared to those in starbursts when normalized by [N II]. This comparison is used as a diagnostic tool for PDR and XDR models, respectively.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The paper suggests that (1) The mid-infrared high-ionization lines are consistent with a very high AGN fraction. (2) The LINERs have excess low-ionization line emission, especially in the [Fe II] 26 μm and [Si II] 34.8 μm PDR tracers. (3) There is a significant difference between IR-luminous and IR-faint LINERs in their mid-infrared properties.
