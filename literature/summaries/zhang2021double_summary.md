Title: Double Robust Semi-Supervised Inference for General Treatment Effect Estimation in Observational Studies with Decaying Propensity Scores
Authors: Yifei Li and Tianxiang Bai
Journal: arXiv preprint (2022)
Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the general treatment effect in an observational study where the propensity score is decaying, which is often the case when the treated group has a larger sample size. The traditional inverse probability weighting estimator for the general treatment effect is inconsistent and biased in this setting. In this paper, we propose a double robust (DR) estimator that is consistent and asymptotically normal under mild conditions. Our DR estimator can be viewed as an extension of the DR estimator proposed by Li et al. (2022). The key difference between our DR estimator and their DR estimator is that we use the estimated propensity score in the second step to construct the new robust estimating equation, which makes it possible to achieve a higher order of asymptotic normality. In this paper, we also propose an adjusted RAL expansion for the misspecified outcome model, which can be used to obtain the adjusted conﬁdence interval based on the DR estimator. The proposed DR and the adjusted RAL expansions are completely general and do not rely on any speciﬁc decaying PS models.
