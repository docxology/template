**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Environment-Centric Active Inference" by Esaki et al. (2023) presents a new approach to active inference that is centred around the environment and its role in the process of making decisions. The authors argue that the current approaches to active inference are too focused on the agent, and that this focus can be detrimental when the agent has no control over the environment. They propose an environment-centric approach to active inference where the goal is to make a decision based on the information available about the environment. This paper presents the first steps in developing such an approach by showing how it could work for a simple robotic system, and they also discuss some of the challenges that need to be addressed before this can be applied more widely.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contribution of the paper is the proposal of a new approach to active inference. The authors argue that the current approaches are too focused on the agent and that this focus can be detrimental when the agent has no control over the environment. They propose an environment-centric approach where the goal is to make a decision based on the information available about the environment. This paper presents the first steps in developing such an approach by showing how it could work for a simple robotic system, and they also discuss some of the challenges that need to be addressed before this can be applied more widely.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors propose a new approach to active inference based on the idea that the goal is to make a decision based on the information available about the environment. The paper presents the first steps in developing such an approach by showing how it could work for a simple robotic system, and they also discuss some of the challenges that need to be addressed before this can be applied more widely.

**Results/Data**

The authors present the results from the experiments with a simple robotic system. They show that their new approach is able to make better decisions than the current approaches when the agent has no control over the environment, and they also discuss some of the challenges that need to be addressed before this can be applied more widely.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors present the limitations of the paper in terms of the simplicity of the system used. The approach is able to make better decisions than the current approaches when the agent has no control over the environment, but it needs to be tested on a more complex system before this can be applied more widely.

**Notes**

The paper is a good start for the new approach to active inference that is centred around the environment. The authors discuss some of the challenges that need to be addressed before this can be applied more widely, and they also present the results from the experiments with a simple robotic system.
