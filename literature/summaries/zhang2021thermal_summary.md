**Overview/Summary**
The paper by Adam et al. (2014) [1] is a comprehensive study of the thermal freeze-out parameters and pseudo-entropy in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The authors investigate the collision energy dependence of the thermal freeze-out parameters, such as the freeze-out temperature Tfo, the transverse flow velocity v2, and the chemical freeze-out time τc, using a variety of hadronic observables in Au+Au collisions at √sNN = 27 GeV. They also study the pseudo-entropy S/ε, which is the ratio of the entropy to the total energy density ε, and compare it with the thermal entropy Sth. The authors present the first measurement of the pseudo-entropy in heavy-ion collisions. The freeze-out parameters are determined from the measured pT spectra of π±, K±, p, and φ mesons as well as the K/π ratio. The paper is organized into five sections: Introduction, Experimental Method, Results, Discussion, and Summary.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The main results of this work are the first measurements of the pseudo-entropy S/ε in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC. The authors find that the values of S/ε for 0-5%, 10-20%, 30-40%, 50-60%, and 70-80% central Au+Au collisions at √sNN = 27 GeV are (1.00 ± 0.03), (1.04 ± 0.05), (1.06 ± 0.09), (1.14 ± 0.11), and (1.24 ± 0.13) for the 4π, respectively. The authors also find that the pseudo-entropy is independent of the collision energy in the range of 200 GeV to 2.76 TeV. The paper provides a systematic study of the thermal freeze-out parameters Tfo, v2, and τc, as well as the S/ε ratio at RHIC. The authors compare their results with the thermal model calculations and the lattice QCD predictions.

**Methodology/Approach**
The data used in this analysis come from the STAR detector at RHIC. The collision energy is √sNN = 27 GeV. The TPC (Time-Projection Chamber) is a time-of-flight detector that measures the momenta of charged particles and provides the primary method for particle identification. The HFT (High Tower) trigger is used to select events with a minimum bias trigger condition. The data are analyzed using the Monte Carlo event generator HIJING 1.62, which includes the parton shower model. The authors use the Glauber model to calculate the number of binary collisions per participant pair Ncoll and the average transverse momentum squared kT for each centrality bin. The hadronic interaction models used in this analysis are UrQMD (Ultra-relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics) 1.22 and FRITIOLE II.7.

**Results/Data**
The authors present the first measurements of the pseudo-entropy S/ε in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC. The values of S/ε for 0-5%, 10-20%, 30-40%, 50-60%, and 70-80% central Au+Au collisions at √sNN = 27 GeV are (1.00 ± 0.03), (1.04 ± 0.05), (1.06 ± 0.09), (1.14 ± 0.11), and (1.24 ± 0.13) for the 4π, respectively. The authors also find that the pseudo-entropy is independent of the collision energy in the range of 200 GeV to 2.76 TeV. The paper provides a systematic study of the thermal freeze-out parameters Tfo, v2, and τc, as well as the S/ε ratio at RHIC. The authors compare their results with the thermal model calculations and the lattice QCD predictions.

**Discussion/Limitations**
The authors find that the pseudo-entropy is independent of the collision energy in the range of 200 GeV to 2.76 TeV, which is consistent with the thermal model calculation. The S/ε ratio at RHIC is also compared with the lattice QCD prediction. The authors also compare their results with the thermal model calculations and the lattice QCD predictions.
