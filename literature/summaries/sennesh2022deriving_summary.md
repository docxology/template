**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Deriving time-averaged active inference from control principles" by E. Sennesh et al. (2022) is a thought-provoking work that aims to bridge the gap between two major research traditions in cognitive science and neuroscience. The first, which is often referred to as the "control perspective," is concerned with understanding how an organism's behavior is controlled by its brain. This is typically done using the tools of engineering and control theory. The second, which is sometimes called the "Bayesian perspective," is a statistical approach that can be used for both inference (making predictions) and learning (adjusting parameters). The authors argue that these two perspectives are not mutually exclusive, but rather complementary. The paper's main contribution is to show how the Bayesian perspective can be derived from the control perspective. This is done by showing how the time-averaged active inference (AIF), which is a statistical approach for making inferences about an organism's behavior based on its sensory and motor data, can be obtained as a special case of the optimal control problem. The authors also discuss the implications of this result for understanding interoception, which is the sense that one has of one's own bodily state.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The paper begins by discussing how the Bayesian perspective on AIF is typically derived from the "free energy principle," which is a statistical approach to learning and inference. The authors argue that this is not the only way to derive the AIF, but rather it is a special case of a more general class of problems called the "optimal control" problem. This is because the optimal control problem can be solved using the tools of engineering and control theory. The paper shows how the time-averaged AIF can be obtained as a special case of this problem. In particular, it is shown that the free energy principle is the same thing as the "allostasis" cost function in the optimal control problem. This is because the allostasis cost function is the average over time of the total cost function, which is the sum of the "allostasis" and the "vigorousness" functions. The authors also discuss how the AIF can be used to understand interoception. They argue that this is a special case of the optimal control problem in which the goal is to regulate one's own bodily state rather than to achieve some external goal.

**Methodology/Approach**

The paper begins by discussing the "control perspective" on understanding behavior, which is concerned with how an organism's brain controls its body. This is typically done using the tools of engineering and control theory. The authors argue that this perspective can be used for both learning (adjusting parameters) and inference (making predictions). The authors then discuss the Bayesian perspective, which is a statistical approach to making inferences about behavior based on sensory data. They show how the AIF can be obtained as a special case of the optimal control problem by using the tools of engineering and control theory.

**Results/Data**

The paper shows that the free energy principle is the same thing as the "allostasis" cost function in the optimal control problem. This is because the allostasis cost function is the average over time of the total cost function, which is the sum of the "allostasis" and the "vigorousness" functions. The authors also discuss how the AIF can be used to understand interoception. They argue that this is a special case of the optimal control problem in which the goal is to regulate one's own bodily state rather than to achieve some external goal.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The paper shows that the free energy principle is the same thing as the "allostasis" cost function in the optimal control problem. This is because the allostasis cost function is the average over time of the total cost function, which is the sum of the "allostasis" and the "vigorousness" functions. The authors also discuss how the AIF can be used to understand interoception. They argue that this is a special case of the optimal control problem in which the goal is to regulate one's own bodily state rather than to achieve some external goal.
