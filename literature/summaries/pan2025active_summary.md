**Overview/Summary**

The paper presents a closed-loop sensing and communication framework for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks, which is designed to maximize the value of service provisioning in the context of integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). The authors consider a UAV-assisted wireless network where the UAV can hover at an optimal location to serve multiple users. The UAV's trajectory is optimized based on the users' channel state information, and the communication resource allocation is jointly optimized with the UAV's hovering location. In this paper, the authors propose a sensing-communication-computing (SCC) closed-loop framework for 6G unmanned robotic systems. The SCC framework includes three main components: sensing, communication, and control. The sensing component is based on active inference, which is used to predict the users' channel state information. The communication component is based on a joint optimization of the UAV's hovering location and the communication resource allocation. The control component is based on a joint optimization of the UAV's trajectory and the communication resource allocation.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this paper are: 1) A sensing-communication-computing (SCC) closed-loop framework for 6G unmanned robotic systems; 2) An active inference framework for the closed-loop SCS problem. The authors first propose a sensing-communication-computing (SCS) framework for 6G digital twin-enabled UAVs, which includes three main components: sensing, communication, and control. The sensing component is based on active inference, which is used to predict the users' channel state information. The communication component is based on a joint optimization of the UAV's hovering location and the communication resource allocation. The control component is based on a joint optimization of the UAV's trajectory and the communication resource allocation. The authors propose an SCS problem in the context of ISAC, which is formulated as a closed-loop optimization problem. In this paper, the authors first formulate the SCS problem for 6G digital twin-enabled UAVs.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The limitations and future work of this paper are: 1) The proposed SCS problem is based on the assumption that all the users' channel state information can be obtained by the UAV, which may not be true in practical scenarios. In the future research, it is necessary to consider the scenario where the UAV does not have the complete knowledge about the users' channel state information; 2) The proposed SCS problem is based on the assumption that all the users are served by a single UAV, which may not be true in practical scenarios. In the future research, it is necessary to consider the scenario where multiple UAVs are used to serve different groups of users.
