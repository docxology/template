**Overview/Summary**
Resonating Minds: Emergent Collaboration Through Hierarchical Active Inference is a research paper published in the journal NeurIPS 2021. The authors propose an emergent collaboration approach that enables multiple agents to work together without explicit communication, by using a hierarchical generative model with two central layers: possible goals and intentions. They show that this simple framework can be used to implement different mentalizing strategies for other agents' actions in the same way as it is done for one's own actions. The authors evaluate their proposed approach on the challenging task of multi-agent navigation, by using a simulated 3D environment with 10 objects and 4 goals. They show that the emergent collaboration can be used to implement different mentalizing strategies for other agents' actions in the same way as it is done for one's own actions.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The key contributions of this paper are:
- The authors propose an emergent collaboration approach, which enables multiple agents to work together without explicit communication. This is achieved by using a hierarchical generative model with two central layers: possible goals and intentions.
- They show that the emergent collaboration can be used to implement different mentalizing strategies for other agents' actions in the same way as it is done for one's own actions.

**Methodology/Approach**
The proposed approach uses a Baysian inference framework, which is based on the generative model. The authors use this framework to infer the other agent's mental states from its own observations and action selection capabilities. They also propose an approximate but "satisfying" solution for the problem of inferring the other agent's mental states. This is achieved by approximating the likelihood P(a| i, g, o) with α if a = a∗, where a∗ is the action the agent would take in the situation o if it had intention i and goal g. They use this approximation to model how similar we are assuming the other agent to be. Low values ofα will lead to more random actions, different from what the agent would do itself.

**Results/Data**
The authors evaluate their proposed approach on a simulated 3D environment with 10 objects and 4 goals. The results show that the emergent collaboration can be used to implement different mentalizing strategies for other agents' actions in the same way as it is done for one's own actions. They also compare the performance of the proposed approach with the common soft-max approach, which models an agent's action likelihoods to correlate with "rational" behavior (usually regulated by the "rationality" parameter).
