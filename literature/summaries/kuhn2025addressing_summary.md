**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Addressing the Subsumption Thesis: A Formal Analysis" by Simon Lovegrove and David Leslie Phillips addresses the subsumption thesis in the context of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and Partially Observable MDPs (POMDPs). The authors provide a formal analysis that shows the expected utility agent is not always a special case of an active inference agent. This is in contrast to previous work that has suggested the two are equivalent, which would be a major simplification for the field. In this paper, the authors show that the subsumption thesis does not hold by providing counterexamples and proving a formal result that shows the expected utility agent is not always a special case of an active inference agent.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions are two-fold. The first is to provide a new proof for the divergence objective in MDPs, which is based on the Gibbs distribution. This is useful because it provides a way to use the free energy function as a measure of uncertainty and to get bounds on the expected utility that can be used in planning. The second is to show that the subsumption thesis does not hold by providing counterexamples.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors are able to prove the divergence objective for MDPs (5) using the Gibbs distribution, which is a result of independent interest. They also provide a new proof for the free energy function in POMDPs (10), which is another useful result that can be used in planning.

**Results/Data**

The main results are the counterexamples and the formal analysis that shows the expected utility agent is not always a special case of an active inference agent. The authors show that the subsumption thesis does not hold by providing two counterexamples, one for MDPs and one for POMDPs. The first example is the "Paraglider" MDP (B), which is a single-step MDP with three states and two actions. In this case, the expected utility agent prefers a subset of the optimal active inference agency. For the second counterexample, the authors consider an MDP that has a preference distribution that is a softmax on the rewards. The subsumption thesis does not hold in this case because the active inference agent is indifferent between two actions while the expected utility agent will choose one action.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The main weakness of the paper is its lack of discussion about the implications for the field. In particular, there are no references to previous work that has suggested the subsumption thesis and how this new result can be used in planning. The authors also do not discuss what the divergence objective could be used for.

**Limitations/Weaknesses**

The main weakness is the lack of discussion about the implications for the field. This is because the paper does not provide any examples that show the usefulness of the results, which would have been useful to the reader and would have provided a clearer understanding of what the divergence objective could be used for.
