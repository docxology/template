**Overview/Summary**
The paper "Object-Object Active Inference" by van Bergen and Lanillos (2021) is a novel contribution to the field of active inference in machine learning. The authors propose an approach that allows for more flexible and expressive object-based representations in this framework, which they call "object-object active inference." They do so by extending the original active inference model from [1] to allow for multiple objects with different types of dynamics. This is a key advance because it enables the use of object-based models in a variety of real-world scenarios where there are many interacting objects. The authors also show that their approach can be used to solve problems that were previously not possible in this framework.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The main contributions of the paper are threefold. First, they introduce an extension of the active inference model [1] that allows for multiple objects with different types of dynamics. This is a key advance because it enables the use of object-based models in a variety of real-world scenarios where there are many interacting objects. Second, they show how this approach can be used to solve problems that were previously not possible in this framework. Third, they provide an empirical evaluation of their new model.

**Methodology/Approach**
The authors begin by reviewing the original active inference model [1]. This is a probabilistic generative model where the goal is to infer the state of the world based on observations and prior knowledge. The key insight in this approach is that the posterior distribution over all possible states can be computed exactly, which is not true for most other models. They then describe their new extension of the active inference model, which they call "object-object" (OOAI). This is a probabilistic generative model where the goal is to infer the state of the world based on observations and prior knowledge. The key insight in this approach is that the posterior distribution over all possible states can be computed exactly, which is not true for most other models.

**Results/Data**
The authors provide an empirical evaluation of their new OOAI model. They use a simple simulation to demonstrate the ability of their model to solve problems that were previously not possible in this framework. The results show that their approach can be used to solve these problems and that it is more flexible than the original active inference model.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The authors do not discuss any limitations or future work in the paper, but they suggest a number of potential avenues for further research.
