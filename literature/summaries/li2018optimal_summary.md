**Optimal Distributed Generation Planning in Active Distribution Networks Considering Uncertainty of Wind Power Distributed Generation**

**Overview/Summary**
The increasing penetration of renewable energy sources (RES) in the power grid has made the optimal planning of distributed generation (DG) a crucial problem to be solved. The uncertainty of RES is one of the main factors that affect the DG planning, and the traditional methods are not suitable for this kind of problem. In order to solve this problem, an improved multi-objective harmony search (MOPSO) algorithm is proposed in this paper. The MOPSO is a new optimization method which combines the advantages of the Pareto optimality and the diversity of the population. And it can be used to solve the complex problems with multiple objectives. In order to verify the effectiveness of the improved MOPSO, an optimal DG planning problem in active distribution networks considering the uncertainty of wind power distributed generation is solved by using this algorithm. The results show that the proposed method can obtain a better solution than the traditional methods.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The main contribution of this paper is the application of the improved MOPSO to the optimal DG planning in the active distribution network. This problem is different from the existing problems, and it is more complex than the existing ones. The uncertainty of RES is one of the main factors that affect the DG planning. The traditional methods are not suitable for this kind of problem. In order to solve this problem, an improved MOPSO algorithm is proposed in this paper. This method can obtain a better solution than the traditional methods.

**Methodology/Approach**
The MOPSO is a new optimization method which combines the advantages of the Pareto optimality and the diversity of the population. The main steps to solve the problem by using the improved MOPSO are as follows: First, the improved MOPSO algorithm is proposed. Then, the optimal DG planning in active distribution networks considering the uncertainty of wind power distributed generation is solved by using this algorithm. This method can obtain a better solution than the traditional methods.

**Results/Data**
The results show that the proposed method can obtain a better solution than the traditional methods. The improved MOPSO algorithm can be used to solve the complex problems with multiple objectives, and it has a good application prospect in the field of the optimal DG planning. The uncertainty of RES is one of the main factors that affect the DG planning. The traditional methods are not suitable for this kind of problem.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The main limitation of this paper is the complexity of the problem. This paper only studies the optimal DG planning in active distribution networks considering the uncertainty of wind power distributed generation, and it does not consider other factors that affect the DG planning. In order to solve this problem, a better method should be proposed. The improved MOPSO algorithm can be used to solve the complex problems with multiple objectives, but it is not suitable for solving the high-dimensional problems. The future work will focus on how to improve the MOPSO and how to apply the MOPSO to the more complex problems.
