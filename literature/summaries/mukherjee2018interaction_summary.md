**Overview/Summary**

The paper presents a theoretical study to investigate the interaction of light and semiconductor systems in generating quantum states. The authors demonstrate that the dynamics of the system can be controlled by the initial state of the light field and the nonlinearity of the semiconductor, leading to the generation of various quantum states. In particular, they show that the interaction of light with a two-level atom (TLA) in the presence of an external driving field in the strong coupling regime leads to the generation of a squeezed vacuum state. This is achieved by using a second order nonlinearity of the TLA and the time dependent phase shift due to the external driving field. The authors also show that the interaction of light with a two-level atom (TLA) in the presence of an external driving field in the weak coupling regime leads to the generation of a thermal state, which is different from the vacuum state. In this case, the nonlinearity of the TLA and the time dependent phase shift due to the external driving field are not important for the generation of the thermal state. The authors also show that the interaction of light with an optical parametric oscillator (OPO) in the presence of a second order nonlinearity leads to the generation of a Fock state, which is different from the coherent state. This is achieved by using the first and second order nonlinearity of the OPO and the time dependent phase shift due to the external driving field. The authors also show that the interaction of light with an optical parametric oscillator (OPO) in the presence of a third order nonlinearity leads to the generation of a superposition state, which is different from the Fock state. This is achieved by using the first and second order nonlinearity of the OPO and the time dependent phase shift due to the external driving field.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use the Jaynes-Cummings model for the TLA and the OPO. The Hamiltonian in the rotating wave approximation (RWA) is used to describe the dynamics of the system. The first order nonlinearity is the Kerr effect, which is a second order nonlinearity. The second order nonlinearity is the self-phase modulation (SPM), which is also a second order nonlinearity. The third order nonlinearity is the cross phase modulation (XPM). The authors use the time dependent phase shift due to the external driving field and the nonlinearity of the OPO for the generation of various quantum states.
