**Overview/Summary**
The paper "Inference-Time Scaling for Flow Models via Stochastic Differential Equations" by Song et al. (2022) presents a new inference-time scaling method for flow models that is based on the stochastic differential equations (SDEs). The authors first introduce the concept of inference-time scaling and its importance in the context of generative modeling, which refers to the time complexity of the forward pass during sampling. They then present an SDE-based approach that can be used to scale the inference-time of flow models. This is achieved by introducing a new parameter called "inference-time" (IT) into the original SDE and using it as the scaling factor for the original parameters in the SDE. The authors show that this method can be applied to any flow model, which includes both continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) and discrete normalizing flows (DNFs). The authors also provide a theoretical analysis of the proposed method based on the theory of stochastic differential equations. Finally, the authors conduct experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The main contributions of this paper are twofold. First, the authors introduce an inference-time scaling approach that can be used for flow models. Second, the authors show that the proposed method is effective in practice. The first contribution is a theoretical one, which provides a new perspective on the inference-time and its relationship with the original parameters in the SDEs. This helps to understand how the inference-time affects the performance of the SDE-based generative models. The second finding is an empirical one, which shows that the proposed method can be used to improve the inference-time of flow models. The authors also compare their approach with the existing methods and show that it is more effective.

**Methodology/Approach**
The authors first introduce the concept of inference-time scaling for generative modeling. Then, they present a new SDE-based approach that can be used to scale the inference-time of flow models. This is achieved by introducing an IT into the original SDE and using it as the scaling factor for the original parameters in the SDE. The authors show that this method can be applied to any flow model, which includes both CNFs and DNFS. The authors also provide a theoretical analysis of the proposed method based on the theory of stochastic differential equations.
