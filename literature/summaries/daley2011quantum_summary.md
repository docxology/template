**Overview/Summary**

This paper discusses the potential of using group-II atoms for quantum computing and simulation. The authors point out the advantages of these atoms in comparison to the commonly used alkali metals (group-I) for such applications, which are the subject of many recent studies. The main advantage is that the qubits in a system based on group-II atoms would be less sensitive to decoherence due to magnetic field fluctuations, as the number of available nuclear spin states in these systems is much larger than those in alkali metals. This is because the number of hyperfine structure (hfs) transitions in the ground state for the group-II atoms is much greater than that for the alkali atoms. The authors also point out the possibility to encode more qubits on a single atom, as the number of available nuclear spin states for the 9/2 and 3/2 spins for 87Sr and 23Na are 10 and 8, respectively, compared with the 4 for the 1/2 spin in alkali atoms. The authors do not discuss the possibility to encode more qubits on a single atom in this paper.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contribution of the paper is that it gives an overview of the advantages and disadvantages of using group-II atoms, such as 87Sr and 23Na, for quantum computing and simulation. The authors also provide two examples of complete schemes for quantum computing with these atoms. One scheme uses a Rydberg blockade gate and the other one uses controlled collisions between the qubits in the system based on state-dependent lattices.
