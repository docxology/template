**Overview/Summary**

The paper presents a comprehensive study of charged particle and photon multiplicity in heavy-ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The authors investigate the system size, energy and centrality dependence of the charged particle and photon multiplicity. They also discuss the expansion dynamics of the produced particles using Landau hydrodynamics along with its advanced forms. The pseudorapidity density distribution of photons is studied in different collision systems at various energies.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors find that the system size, energy and centrality dependence of the charged particle multiplicity are similar to those of the photon multiplicity. They also observe a longitudinal scaling of the dN/deta for both the charged particles and photons in the forward rapidity. The ratio of the widths of the data and the Landau-Carruthers fitting is found to be 1 at RHIC energy, but it deviates from 1 at lower energies. The authors also find that the total measured photon multiplicity as a function of Npart is similar for two collision systems.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use the data collected by the PHENIX detector in the most central events (0-5%) and the ALICE detector in the 10% most central events. The dN/deta are fitted with a double Gaussian function to understand the expansion dynamics of the system. The Landau-Carruthers functions are used to check the applicability of the hydrodynamic model for the data at RHIC energy.

**Results/Data**

The authors find that the charged particle and photon multiplicity in the most central events (0-5%) as a function of pseudorapidity is similar for both the Cu+Cu and Au+Au collisions. The dN/deta are also found to be similar for the two collision systems at 62.4 GeV and 200 GeV. The dN/deta in the most central events (0-5%) as a function of pseudorapidity is similar for both the S+Au and Pb+Pb collisions. The dN/deta are found to be similar for the two collision systems at 19.3 GeV and 17.6 GeV. The total measured photon multiplicity as a function of Npart is also similar for the two collision systems.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors find that the ratio of the widths of the data and the Landau-Carruthers fitting is found to be 1 at RHIC energy, but it deviates from 1 at lower energies. The total measured photon multiplicity as a function of Npart is similar for two collision systems.
