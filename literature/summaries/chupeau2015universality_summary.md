**Overview/Summary**

The authors of this paper investigate the universality classes of foraging with resource renewal in a one-dimensional model where an individual can only eat at a single site and the resource is replenished after a certain number of time steps, $R$. The main result of the paper is that there are three different universality classes depending on the value of $R$, which is the same as the number of sites visited by the forager. In the first class (immortal regime), the forager can survive forever if the renewal happens after a certain time, and in the second class (mortal regime), the forager starves to death if the renewal does not happen before this time. The third class is a transition region between the two universality classes. In this paper, the authors provide a general mathematical framework for the problem of foraging with resource renewal and use it to study the three different universality classes.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this paper are the following:
1. The authors show that there is a transition region between the immortal regime and the mortal regime, which is not a single point but an interval in $R$. In the transition region, the forager starves to death if the renewal happens before a certain time, and survives forever if it does not happen before this time.
2. The authors show that the three different universality classes are determined by the value of $R$ only, which is the same as the number of sites visited by the forager.
3. The authors provide a general mathematical framework for the problem of foraging with resource renewal and use it to study the three different universality classes.

**Methodology/Approach**

The main approach of this paper is to introduce a new parameter $R^{\prime}$, which is the same as the number of sites visited by the forager. The authors show that the value of $R$ only determines the universality class of the foraging process with resource renewal in the one-dimensional model.

**Results/Data**

The main results of this paper are the following:
1. The authors determine the maximal value $R^{\prime}$ of the renewal time such that the forager can survive forever if the renewal happens after this time, and show that the forager starves to death if the renewal does not happen before this time.
2. The authors determine the minimal value $R^{\prime\prime}$ of the renewal time such that the forager is sure to eat when the renewal happens on a most unfavorable trajectory.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The main limitation of this paper is that it only studies the one-dimensional model, and does not study the higher dimensional models. The authors do not discuss the universality classes of the foraging process with resource renewal in the higher dimensional models. It would be interesting to see whether there are three different universality classes or a single point in $R$.
