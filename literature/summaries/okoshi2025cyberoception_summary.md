**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Cyberoception: Finding a Painlessly- Measurable New Sense in the Cyberworld Towards Emotion-Awareness in Computing" proposes an innovative approach to measure human cyberoception by using mobile devices and machine learning techniques. The authors argue that traditional methods for measuring human perception, such as self-reporting or physiological signals, are not suitable for real-world applications because they are invasive, expensive, or time-consuming. They also claim that the current approaches of collecting data from mobile devices do not take into account the user's emotional state and context, which is essential to understand cyberoception. The paper presents an approach to measure human cyberoception by using a machine learning model trained with a dataset collected in a real-world setting.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors first discuss the concept of cyberoception, its relationship with emotion awareness, and the importance of measuring it. They then present their data collection method and the challenges they faced when collecting the data. The paper also presents the results of an experiment that was conducted to measure the accuracy of a machine learning model in predicting human cyberoception. Finally, the authors discuss the limitations of the current work and future research directions.
