**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Simple subvector inference on sharp identified set in affine" by [Authors] (Year) is a contribution to the field of econometrics that provides new and useful results for the analysis of the identified set. The authors' main goal is to provide a general method for making valid statistical inferences about the support function of the identified set, which is the set of values that are not ruled out by the data. This paper is organized as follows: In Section 1, we introduce the problem and the main contributions. In Section 2, we discuss the methodology and approach used to obtain the results. The results are presented in Section 3, and limitations and discussion follow in Section 4.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors' main contribution is a new method for making valid statistical inferences about the support function of the identified set. In particular, they show that if the sharp identified set is a singleton, then the regularized value function (which is the value function with an added regularization term) can be consistently estimated at the parametric rate 1/√n. This result holds even when the true parameter vector does not lie in the interior of the identified set. The authors also show that if the sharp identified set is not a singleton, then the regularized value function can be consistently estimated at the nonparametric rate n^r for some r > 0. The authors' results are useful for making valid statistical inferences about the support function of the identified set because they provide an explicit and consistent estimator of this quantity that does not require the true parameter vector to lie in the interior of the identified set. The authors also show that their method can be used to make valid one-sided confidence sets.

**Methodology/Approach**

The paper is based on a general framework for making statistical inferences about the support function of the identified set, which was introduced by [Authors] (Year). In this paper, the authors provide new and useful results for the analysis of the identified set. The authors' main goal is to provide a general method for making valid statistical inferences about the support function of the identified set. The authors' approach is based on the idea that the value function with a regularization term can be used as an estimator of the support function, and they show that if the sharp identified set is not a singleton, then the regularized value function can be consistently estimated at the nonparametric rate n^r for some r > 0. The authors' results are useful for making valid statistical inferences about the support function of the identified set because they provide an explicit and consistent estimator of this quantity that does not require the true parameter vector to lie in the interior of the identified set.

**Results/Data**
