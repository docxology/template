**Overview/Summary**

The GTSP (Generalized Traveling Salesman Problem) is a well-known NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization. The authors of the paper propose an algorithm for solving this problem by using a colony of artificial ants, which is called CAACS (Carbon Aware Ant Colony System). This algorithm can solve the GTSP to the best known approximation ratio 3/2, and it also has a good performance on the instances with small number of clusters. The authors use a new heuristic method for generating an initial solution in the CAACS, which is called the carbon aware ant (CA) model. In this paper, the authors first propose a new pheromone updating rule based on the carbon aware ant model and then use it to design the CAACS algorithm. This algorithm can be used to solve the GTSP with different number of clusters.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of the paper are as follows: 1) The authors propose a new heuristic method for generating an initial solution in the CAACS, which is called the carbon aware ant (CA) model. This algorithm can be used to generate an initial feasible solution for the GTSP. In this paper, the authors first use the CA model to design the CAACS algorithm. 2) The authors propose a new pheromone updating rule based on the CA model and then use it to design the CAACS algorithm. The CAACS algorithm can solve the GTSP to the best known approximation ratio 3/2, and it also has a good performance on the instances with small number of clusters.

**Methodology/Approach**
