**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Active and sparse methods in smoothed model checking" by Bortolussi et al. (2016) [4] introduces two new statistical approaches for the problem of smoothed model checking (SMC), which is a method to check whether a given continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) satisfies a temporal logic property, and it is uncertain what the probability of satisfying this property is. The first approach, called active SMC, is based on an active learning algorithm that uses a query strategy in order to minimize the number of queries needed to achieve a desired level of confidence for the property. The second one, called sparse SMC, is based on a sparse approximation of the CTMC and it can be used with any query strategy. Both approaches are designed to improve the efficiency of SMC by reducing the number of queries.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this paper are two new statistical methods for the problem of smoothed model checking (SMC). The first one, called active SMC, is based on an active learning algorithm that uses a query strategy in order to minimize the number of queries needed to achieve a desired level of confidence for the property. The second one, called sparse SMC, is based on a sparse approximation of the CTMC and it can be used with any query strategy. Both approaches are designed to improve the efficiency of SMC by reducing the number of queries.

**Methodology/Approach**

The paper starts with an overview of the existing work in model checking for temporal logic properties. The authors then introduce the problem of smoothed model checking, which is a method to check whether a given continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) satisfies a temporal logic property, and it is uncertain what the probability of satisfying this property is. The first approach, called active SMC, is based on an active learning algorithm that uses a query strategy in order to minimize the number of queries needed to achieve a desired level of confidence for the property. The second one, called sparse SMC, is based on a sparse approximation of the CTMC and it can be used with any query strategy. Both approaches are designed to improve the efficiency of SMC by reducing the number of queries.

**Results/Data**

The paper first shows that the existing work in model checking for temporal logic properties has two main limitations: the method is not efficient enough, and the method may not be applicable to all temporal logic properties. The authors then introduce a new approach to solve this problem. In the new approach, the probability of satisfying the property is unknown in advance, but it can be estimated by an active learning algorithm. This algorithm uses a query strategy that is designed to minimize the number of queries needed to achieve a desired level of confidence for the property. The authors also introduce another new approach called sparse SMC. In this approach, the probability of satisfying the property is unknown in advance, but it can be estimated by a sparse approximation of the CTMC and any query strategy. Both approaches are designed to improve the efficiency of SMC by reducing the number of queries.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The paper also discusses some limitations of the existing work in model checking for temporal logic properties. The authors then discuss some possible future research directions based on the new approach. For example, it is not clear whether the active and sparse approaches can be used to solve the problem of statistical parameter synthesis.
