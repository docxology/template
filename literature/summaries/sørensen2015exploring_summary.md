**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Exploring the Quantum Speed Limit with Computer Games" presents a new approach to understanding the quantum speed limit (QSL) in the context of the Bohnenstel-Halperin-Wilczek (BHW) process. The authors use computer games, specifically the citizen science game Quantum Moves, as a platform for exploring the QSL. In this paper, they explore the relationship between the QSL and the optimal control of quantum processes. The QSL is the minimum time required to achieve a given fidelity in a quantum process. The BHW process is a general framework that can be used to describe various quantum processes, including the adiabatic evolution of a closed system from an initial state to a target state. In this paper, the authors use the BHW process as a paradigm for studying the QSL and its relation to the optimal control of quantum processes. The authors show that the BHW process is equivalent to the Krotov algorithm, which is widely used in the study of open systems. The authors then use the BHW process to study the relationship between the QSL and the direct Hilbert velocity. They also compare the results for the different strategies: the optimal control (CHOP), the tunneling strategy, and the shoveling strategy.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this paper are as follows:

1. **Equivalence to the Krotov algorithm**: The authors show that the BHW process is equivalent to the Krotov algorithm. This result is important for understanding the relationship between the QSL and the optimal control of quantum processes.

2. **Relationship with the direct Hilbert velocity**: The authors find a non-constant time average of the direct Hilbert speed (Q) in the different clans, which explains the deviation from the sin2(π/2TQSL) behavior in the paper. They also show that the QSL is not a universal limit for all quantum processes.

3. **Comparison with the traditional sin2(π/2TQSL) behaviour**: The authors observe that the BHW process can be used to study the relationship between the QSL and the direct Hilbert velocity. The time average of the direct Hilbert speed (Q) is not constant in the different clans, which explains the deviation from the traditional sin2(π/2TQSL) behaviour.

**Extended Data Figures**

Extended Data figure 1: Deviations from sin2 - behaviour. Colouring as in Fig. 1. Panel a shows the fidelity as a function of duration for the optimal families rescaled by the apparent QSL. The TQSL is found for each solution by fitting sin2(aT + b). The black line shows sin2(π/2T) for reference. Panel b shows the direct Hilbert speed  for the best solutions found by HILO, tunneling and shoveling clans respectively. Note that  is only deﬁned for durations with F  <1 so the curves end at different durations. The varying direct Hilbert speed explains the deviation from sin2(π/2TQSL) on the a.

Extended Data figure 2: The reachability plot for Fig. 3b. The distance between subsequent solutions as calculated by Eq. 1. Valleys identify closely spaced solutions, denoted clans. The valleys corresponding to tunneling and shoveling clans are marked with yellow and blue respectively. The black line marks the threshold for the distance between consecutive solutions in a clan at 0.05.

Extended Data figure 3: Solutions from CHOP and HILO. The amplitude and the position of the tweezer as a function of time for the best player solutions in the tunneling (yellow) and shoveling (blue) clans and the best HILO (purple). The dashed purple line shows the initial seed used by the best HILO solution  (note that the dashed and solid purple lines in the top panel overlap). The total duration is T = 0.15.
