**Overview/Summary**

The authors of this study present a multi-source thermal model for the production of final-state neutral pions and identified charged hadrons in high-energy heavy-ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The model is based on the assumption that the transverse momentum spectra of the produced particles can be described by the superposition of two or three components, which are related to the contributions from different parton sources. In this framework, each source is characterized by a given kinetic freeze-out temperature and average transverse flow velocity. The authors use this model to study the production of pions and charged hadrons in Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV and d+Au collisions at 200 GeV, as well as in pp collisions at 200 GeV. They find that the first component is dominant for all particles in the low transverse momentum region, while the second and third components are relatively small but not negligible. The authors also study the dependence of the kinetic freeze-out temperature and average transverse flow velocity on the centrality of the collision. In this paper, the authors use a standard distribution to be the baseline in comparing with other experiments and simulation studies.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main findings of this work are that the first component is dominant for all particles in the low transverse momentum region, while the second and third components are relatively small but not negligible. The authors also find that the kinetic freeze-out temperature and average transverse flow velocity for each component do not change significantly with the decrease in centrality from central to peripheral collisions. Due to the very small contribution fractions of the second and third components, the main parameters are determined by the first component in the low transverse momentum region. The result corresponding to the isotropic azimuthal angles is similar to that of the identical azimuthal angles. The kinetic freeze-out temperature decreases with the decrease in centrality for the production of the charged massive hadrons.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use a multi-source thermal model, which is based on the assumption that the transverse momentum spectra of the final-state neutral pions and identified charged hadrons can be described by the superposition of two or three components. The number of the components is related to the width of the transverse momentum region. In this framework, each source is characterized by a given kinetic freeze-out temperature and average transverse flow velocity. The authors use this model to study the production of pions and charged hadrons in Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV and d+Au collisions at 200 GeV, as well as in pp collisions at 200 GeV. They find that the first component is dominant for all particles in the low transverse momentum region, while the second and third components are relatively small but not negligible. The authors also study the dependence of the kinetic freeze-out temperature and average transverse flow velocity on the centrality of the collision. In this paper, the authors use a standard distribution to be the baseline in comparing with other experiments and simulation studies.

**Results/Data**

The results calculated by the Monte Carlo method fit satisfactorily the experimental data measured by the PHENIX and STAR Collaborations. With the decrease in centrality from central to peripheral collisions, the kinetic freeze-out temperature and average transverse flow velocity for each component in pion production do not change significantly. Due to the very small contribution fractions of the second and third components, the main parameters are determined by the first component in the low transverse momentum region. The result corresponding to the isotropic azimuthal angles is similar to that of the identical azimuthal angles. The kinetic freeze-out temperature decreases with the decrease in centrality for the production of the charged massive hadrons.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The work based on the standard distribution is suitable to be the baseline in comparing with other experiments and simulation studies.
