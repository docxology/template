**Overview/Summary**
The paper "On Kalman-Bucy filters, linear quadratic methods and active inference" by Manuel Baltieri and Christopher L Buckley is a mathematical review of the free energy principle for action and perception. The authors provide an in-depth analysis of the relationship between the free energy principle (FEP) and the stochastic control theory, which is used to derive the Kalman-Bucy filter. The FEP is a framework that provides a probabilistic explanation for the emergence of the brain's function based on the concept of active inference. This paper focuses on the linear case where the generative model is Gaussian. The authors discuss how the FEP can be viewed as an implementation of the Kalman-Bucy filter, which is a well-known optimal control strategy in the context of stochastic control theory. They also provide a comparison between the value function and the free energy functional that are used to derive the Kalman-Bucy filter and the FEP respectively. The authors' main contribution is to show how the FEP can be viewed as an implementation of the Kalman-Bucy filter, which is a well-known optimal control strategy in the context of stochastic control theory. The paper also provides a comparison between the value function and the free energy functional that are used to derive the Kalman-Bucy filter and the FEP respectively.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The authors show how the FEP can be viewed as an implementation of the Kalman-Bucy filter, which is a well-known optimal control strategy in the context of stochastic control theory. The main contribution is that the FEP is not only a probabilistic explanation for the emergence of the brain's function but also a mathematical framework to derive the Kalman-Bucy filter. This paper provides an alternative perspective on the relationship between the value function and the free energy functional, which are used to derive the Kalman-Bucy filter and the FEP respectively.

**Methodology/Approach**
The authors' approach is based on the stochastic control theory. The authors use the linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) problem as a starting point for the derivation of the Kalman-Bucy filter. They also discuss how the LQG problem can be viewed as an implementation of the FEP. The authors provide a comparison between the value function and the free energy functional that are used to derive the Kalman-Bucy filter and the FEP respectively.

**Results/Data**
The main results in this paper are about the relationship between the FEP and the stochastic control theory. The authors show how the FEP can be viewed as an implementation of the Kalman-Bucy filter, which is a well-known optimal control strategy in the context of stochastic control theory. The authors also provide a comparison between the value function and the free energy functional that are used to derive the Kalman-Bucy filter and the FEP respectively.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The main weakness of this paper is that it only focuses on the linear case where the generative model is Gaussian. It would be interesting if the authors could provide a comparison between the value function and the free energy functional in the non-linear case, which may lead to more insights about the relationship between the FEP and the stochastic control theory.
