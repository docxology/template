=== OVERVIEW ===
The present work is a preliminary attempt to parameterize the transverse momentum spectra of lepton pairs (ℓ¯) in Drell-Yan process with two simple functions and to study the statistical behavior of their parameters. The two functions are used to describe the ℓ¯ spectrum in Drell-Yan process, which can be considered as an initial step for the purpose of parameterization with simple expressions. The first function is the Gaussian function, which has been widely used in the literature. The second function is a new one proposed by us and it also has the same number of parameters as the Gaussian function. The two functions are compared to each other. The statistical behavior of the parameters of the two functions is studied by using the data from the LEP experiment. The results show that the parameters of the two functions have similar small values, but they have different trends. The first function has a clear peak at pT = 0 and its value decreases as pT increases. The second function has no peak and it is almost constant in the whole region of pT. The results also indicate that the parameters of the two functions are not very sensitive to the center-of-mass energy. The two functions have similar small values, but they have different trends. The first function has a clear peak at pT = 0 and its value decreases as pT increases. The second function has no peak and it is almost constant in the whole region of pT. The results also indicate that the parameters of the two functions are not very sensitive to the center-of-mass energy.
