**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Successor Representation Active Inference" by Beric M. [et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.03904.pdf) presents a new perspective on the relationship between control and inference in the context of reinforcement learning (RL). The authors provide an extensive mathematical walkthrough, which is followed by a discussion of the free energy principle. They then describe how the expected free energy can be used to define a family of probabilistic objectives for RL that are closely related to the classical Bellman-Hamilton-Jacobi equation and the maximum entropy objective. The paper also provides a step-by-step tutorial on active inference, which is applied to empirical data.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors show that the expected free energy can be used to define a family of probabilistic objectives for RL that are closely related to the classical Bellman-Hamilton-Jacobi equation and the maximum entropy objective. The paper also provides a step-by-step tutorial on active inference, which is applied to empirical data.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors first provide an extensive mathematical walkthrough of the free energy principle. They then describe how the expected free energy can be used to define a family of probabilistic objectives for RL that are closely related to the classical Bellman-Hamilton-Jacobi equation and the maximum entropy objective. The paper also provides a step-by-step tutorial on active inference, which is applied to empirical data.

**Results/Data**

The authors show that the expected free energy can be used to define a family of probabilistic objectives for RL that are closely related to the classical Bellman-Hamilton-Jacobi equation and the maximum entropy objective. The paper also provides a step-by-step tutorial on active inference, which is applied to empirical data.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors discuss the relationship between active inference and control as inference. They also discuss the origin of information-seeking exploration in probabilistic objectives for control. The authors also discuss the limitations of their work and future directions.
