**Overview/Summary**

The paper presents an integrative model for interoception and exteroception, which is a theoretical framework for understanding how we sense the physiological state of our body (interoception) and the external environment (exteroception). The authors propose that interoception is not just about sensing bodily sensations but also involves active inference in the brain to construct an integrated representation of the self. This model is based on the theory of constructed emotion, which suggests that emotions are not directly sensed from the body or the world, but rather are inferred by the brain through a process called "interoception" and the process of categorization. The authors also suggest that interoception is an active process in which the brain constructs a representation of the self based on the information it receives from the body and the external environment. This model provides a new perspective for understanding how we sense the physiological state of our body, including the role of cognitive processes such as attention and inference.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this paper are the development of an integrative framework that integrates interoception with exteroception and the proposal that interoception is not just about sensing bodily sensations but also involves active inference in the brain to construct a representation of the self. The authors suggest that interoception is an active process in which the brain constructs a representation of the self based on the information it receives from the body and the external environment. This new perspective for understanding how we sense the physiological state of our body, including the role of cognitive processes such as attention and inference, can be used to explain why interoception is important for our well-being.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use a theoretical approach to develop an integrative model that integrates interoception with exteroception. The paper does not describe any experiments or data collection methods. It only provides a conceptual framework based on the theory of constructed emotion and active inference in the brain. This is because the paper is a theoretical work that aims at developing a new perspective for understanding how we sense the physiological state of our body, including the role of cognitive processes such as attention and inference.

**Results/Data**
