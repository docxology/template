**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Activity induced by Gravitational Interaction in Galaxy Pairs" is a study of the activity in the spiral component of mixed-morphology galaxy pairs, where one member is an elliptical and the other is a late-type (Sd or Sc) galaxy. The main goal of this research is to investigate whether the activity in the spiral component is induced by the gravitational interaction between the two galaxies. This is done by comparing the distribution of the projected distance between the spiral and the early-type (elliptical) companion for the "normal" (star-forming) and active (AGN) nuclei, as well as the distribution of the projected distance between the spiral and the late-type (Sd or Sc) companion. The main result is that the activity in the spiral component tends to be closer to its early-type (elliptical) companion than for the "normal" (star-forming) nucleus.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The most striking finding of this study is that only 1 out of 39 active nuclei can be classified as type 1. Even if in the present analysis we cannot separate LINERs from Seyferts, this result is very much at odds with the expectation of the so-called Uniﬁed Model (UM). A frequency of 2.6% for the presence of type 1 activity is too low to be explained by an obscuration-inclination eﬀect alone. The most important contribution of this study is that only 1 out of the 39 active nuclei can be classiﬁed as type 1.

The above evolutionary scenario explains in a straight forward way the results found in this work for the spiral component of the mixed-morphology pairs. This implies that interactions play a key role in triggering nuclear activity.

**Methodology/Approach**

The sample used in this study is based on the 1995 ﬁnal release of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) snapshot survey, which contains 108 galaxy pairs with a projected distance between the two galaxies less than or equal to 500 kpc. The main selection criterion for the sample is that one member of the pair is an elliptical and the other is a late-type (Sd or Sc) galaxy.

The authors use the HST F814W filter in order to select the "normal" (star-forming) nuclei, with the 25th magnitude being about 23.5. The authors also use the HST F606W filter for the active (AGN) nuclei, with the 25th magnitude being about 22.5. The authors use the HST images to determine the activity in the spiral component of the mixed-morphology galaxy pairs.
