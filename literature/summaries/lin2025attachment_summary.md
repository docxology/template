**Overview/Summary**
The paper "Attachment: a predictive coding approach" proposes a new theoretical framework for understanding attachment and its relation to allostasis in the context of predictive processing. The authors argue that attachment is not just an early experience, but also a long-term process that continues throughout life. In this process, the brain's ability to make predictions about the environment is shaped by the accuracy of the prediction errors it has learned from past experiences. This framework is based on the idea that the brain is always trying to minimize its energy expenditure and maximize its allostasis. The authors suggest that attachment issues in early childhood can lead to biases in attention that are maladaptive later in life, preventing important concepts from being learned and jeopardizing allostasis.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The paper's main findings are based on the idea of a predictive coding approach, which is an extension of the free energy principle. The authors argue that the brain is always trying to minimize its energy expenditure and maximize its allostasis. This means that the brain will tend to reduce the precision of prediction errors in order to avoid the high cost of processing them. In this paper, the authors propose a new hypothesis about the type A and C strategies described by the DMM (Crittenden 2016). According to the authors' framework, early experiences shape the development of attention, which is biased towards learning the most relevant concepts for allostasis in the short-term. The youngest infants are almost entirely dependent on caregivers in maintaining their allostasis, and thus they prioritize encoding the prediction errors that their caregivers help them to resolve. In this paper, the authors propose new hypotheses about the type A and C strategies described by the DMM (Crittenden 2016). Unless otherwise mentioned, every claim in this section is merely a hypothesis entailed by the framework which would require further evidence to confirm.

**Methodology/Approach**
The authors' approach is based on the idea of a predictive coding approach. The authors suggest that early experiences shape the development of attention and future learning. Initially, bottom-up processing is dominant, and the youngest infants attend to stimuli in a relatively unbiased manner. However, as more and more concepts are learned, this shifts to a more self-fulfilling, top-down mode of processing. This means that the brain will tend to reduce the precision of prediction errors in order to avoid the high cost of processing them. In this paper, the authors propose new hypotheses about the type A and C strategies described by the DMM (Crittenden 2016). Unless otherwise mentioned, every claim in this section is merely a hypothesis entailed by the framework which would require further evidence to confirm.

**Results/Data**
The main results of the paper are based on the idea that the brain is always trying to minimize its energy expenditure and maximize its allostasis. This means that the brain will tend to reduce the precision of prediction errors in order to avoid the high cost of processing them. The authors suggest that early experiences shape the development of attention, which is biased towards learning the most relevant concepts for allostasis in the short-term. The youngest infants are almost entirely dependent on caregivers in maintaining their allostasis, and thus they prioritize encoding the prediction errors that their caregivers help them to resolve.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The authors' framework suggests that early attachment experiences can lead to biases in attention that are maladaptive later in life, preventing important concepts from being learned and jeopardizing allostasis. The paper does not discuss any specific limitations or future work.
