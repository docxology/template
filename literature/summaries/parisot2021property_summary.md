**Overview/Summary**
The paper "Property Inference Attacks on Convolutional Neural Networks" is a research study in the field of computer science that focuses on the privacy risks of deep learning systems. The authors investigate the inference attacks on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and propose a new attack method to infer user attributes from a pre-trained model. They show that the property information can be inferred from the gradients of the target model, which is an important finding in the field of machine learning. In this paper, the authors first review the existing attacks on CNNs and then introduce their new inference attack based on the gradient-based approach. The key contributions of this study are to propose a new inference attack that can infer user attributes from a pre-trained model and show that the property information can be inferred from the gradients of the target model. In the following sections, we will summarize the paper's main findings and methodology.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The authors first review the existing attacks on CNNs. They find that the previous inference attack methods are not practical for real-world applications because they require a large number of queries to the target model. Then, they propose a new inference attack method based on the gradient-based approach. The key finding is that the property information can be inferred from the gradients of the target model.
