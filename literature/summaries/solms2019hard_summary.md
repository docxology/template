**Overview/Summary**

The Hard Problem of Consciousness and the Free Energy Principle

Consciousness is a fundamental problem in philosophy of mind that has been debated for centuries. The authors argue that this problem can be addressed by the free energy principle, which is an important concept in the field of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. The free energy principle states that all physical systems will tend to evolve towards the state with the lowest free energy. This is a general principle and applies to all physical systems including living organisms. In order to explain the hard problem of consciousness, the authors propose that the brain can be considered as an open system in which the free energy is the difference between the internal and external energies. The internal energy is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies of the neurons. The external energy is the energy from the environment. The free energy principle states that the brain will tend to evolve towards a state with the lowest free energy, i.e., the state where the internal energy is equal to the external energy. This means that the brain is in a steady state when it has the same amount of kinetic and potential energies. The authors argue that this is the case for the normal functioning of the brain. However, if the brain is not functioning normally, then there will be an imbalance between the internal and the external energies. In this case, the free energy principle states that the brain will tend to evolve towards a state with the lowest free energy. The authors also argue that the free energy principle can explain the hard problem of consciousness in terms of the free energy. This is because the free energy principle states that all physical systems will tend to evolve towards the state where the internal and the external energies are equal, i.e., the state where the brain is not functioning normally. The authors propose that this is the case for the normal functioning of the brain.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The free energy principle can explain the hard problem of consciousness in terms of the free energy. This is because the free energy principle states that all physical systems will tend to evolve towards a state where the internal and the external energies are equal, i.e., the state where the brain is not functioning normally. The authors propose that this is the case for the normal functioning of the brain. The authors also argue that the free energy principle can explain the hard problem of consciousness in terms of the free energy.

The authors propose that the brain can be considered as an open system in which the free energy is the difference between the internal and the external energies. The internal energy is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies of the neurons. The external energy is the energy from the environment.
