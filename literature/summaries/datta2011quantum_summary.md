**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Quantum Discord and Quantum Computing - An Appraisal" by A. Datta et al. (2011) is a comprehensive review of the concept of quantum discord, which is a measure of the quantumness of a bipartite state. The authors discuss the role of entanglement in mixed-state quantum computation, with a focus on the relationship between the quantum discord and the power of one-way classical information processing. They also provide an appraisal of the current status of the field, highlighting both recent advances and open problems.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this paper are to (i) give a detailed review of the concept of quantum discord, (ii) discuss its role in mixed-state quantum computation, and (iii) highlight the current state of the field. The authors start with a discussion of the original definition of quantum discord by Ozu et al. (2002), which is the difference between the relative entropy of the bipartite state and the relative entropy of the reduced states. They argue that this quantity is not a measure of entanglement, but rather it is a measure of the power of one-way classical information processing. The authors then discuss the relationship between the quantum discord and the power of one-way classical information processing in terms of the ability to perform a certain type of measurement on the bipartite state. They also discuss the role of the relative entropy of the reduced states, which is the difference between the von Neumann entropy of the bipartite state and the sum of the two individual von Neumann entropies. The authors argue that this quantity is not a measure of quantumness, but rather it is a measure of the power of one-way classical information processing. The authors also discuss the relationship between the relative entropy of the reduced states and the ability to perform a certain type of measurement on the bipartite state. They then provide an appraisal of the current status of the field, highlighting both recent advances and open problems.

**Methodology/Approach**

The approach taken by the authors is to give a detailed review of the concept of quantum discord, with a focus on its role in mixed-state quantum computation. The authors first discuss the original definition of quantum discord by Ozu et al. (2002), which is the difference between the relative entropy of the bipartite state and the relative entropy of the reduced states. They then argue that this quantity is not a measure of entanglement, but rather it is a measure of the power of one-way classical information processing. The authors also discuss the relationship between the quantum discord and the power of one-way classical information processing in terms of the ability to perform a certain type of measurement on the bipartite state. They then provide an appraisal of the current status of the field, highlighting both recent advances and open problems.

**Results/Data**

The main results of this paper are that (i) quantum discord is not a measure of entanglement, but rather it is a measure of the power of one-way classical information processing, (ii) the relative entropy of the reduced states is not a measure of quantumness, but rather it is a measure of the power of one-way classical information processing, and (iii) the current status of the field. The authors also discuss the role of the relative entropy of the reduced states in terms of the ability to perform a certain type of measurement on the bipartite state.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The main limitations of this paper are that it is a review article, and therefore it does not contain any new results. The authors do not discuss the current status of the field in detail, but rather they give an overview of the current status of the field. The authors also do not provide a comprehensive discussion of all the recent advances in the field.
