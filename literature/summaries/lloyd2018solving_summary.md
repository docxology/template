**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Solving Sudoku with Ant Colony Optimisation" presents a novel approach to solving the classic puzzle game of Sudoku using the ant colony optimisation (ACO) algorithm. The authors first present an overview of the ACO algorithm and its application in combinatorial optimisation, then describe how it can be used to solve the Sudoku problem. They compare their results with those obtained by other methods.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this paper are the use of the ACO algorithm for solving Sudoku puzzles and the comparison of the performance of the proposed algorithm with that of others. The authors show that the ACO is a good optimisation technique to solve the Sudoku problem, especially in terms of the quality of the solutions found.

**Methodology/Approach**

The ACO algorithm is an iterative process, which starts from an initial solution and then iteratively improves it until no further improvement can be made. The authors describe how the ACO works for solving the Sudoku problem. In this paper, they use the original ACO to solve the Sudoku problem. The proposed approach is compared with the results of other methods.

**Results/Data**

The authors compare the performance of their algorithm with that of others. The experimental results show that the ACO is a good optimisation technique for solving the Sudoku problem. In this paper, they use the original ACO to solve the Sudoku problem. The proposed approach is compared with the results of other methods.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors discuss the limitations and future work in the last section of the paper. They mention that the ACO algorithm may not be suitable for solving all types of Sudoku puzzles, especially those which are very difficult to solve. In this paper, they use the original ACO to solve the Sudoku problem. The proposed approach is compared with the results of other methods.
