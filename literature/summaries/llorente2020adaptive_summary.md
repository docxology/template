**Overview/Summary**
The paper proposes a new adaptive quadrature scheme for Bayesian inference via active learning. The authors consider the problem of approximating expectations with respect to a target distribution that is unknown in advance but has a finite number of possible values. They propose an algorithm which, at each step, chooses the next value based on the current best estimate and the current worst estimate, and show that this strategy leads to the optimal solution for the case where the target distribution is discrete. The authors also provide a numerical comparison with other adaptive quadrature rules.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The main contributions of the paper are:
- A new adaptive quadrature scheme for Bayesian inference which chooses the next value based on the current best and worst estimates, and show that this strategy leads to the optimal solution in the case where the target distribution is discrete.
- The authors provide a numerical comparison with other adaptive quadrature rules.

**Methodology/Approach**
The paper considers the problem of approximating expectations with respect to a target distribution that is unknown in advance but has a finite number of possible values. The authors propose an algorithm which, at each step, chooses the next value based on the current best estimate and the current worst estimate, and show that this strategy leads to the optimal solution for the case where the target distribution is discrete.

**Results/Data**
The results are numerical comparisons with other adaptive quadrature rules. The paper does not report any experimental data or statistical analysis.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The main weakness of the paper is the lack of a theoretical comparison with the existing methods, which may be due to the fact that the authors only compare their method with some simple adaptive quadrature rules and do not consider the more sophisticated adaptive quadrature schemes. The authors also mention the case where the target distribution is continuous but this is just an aside comment without any further discussion.
