**Overview/Summary**

The paper proposes a new method for active emulation of computer codes with Gaussian processes (GPs). The authors discuss the importance of this problem in the context of Bayesian calibration and introduce the GP-based approach as an alternative to the traditional Kriging method. They also provide a comparison between the two approaches, which is based on the analysis of the computational cost. The paper does not contain any new results.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contribution of this work is the introduction of the GP-based active learning algorithm for computer code emulation. The authors compare the Kriging and GP-based methods in terms of the computational cost, which is the only thing they are concerned about. They do not discuss the theoretical or practical implications of their method.

**Methodology/Approach**

The paper starts with a brief introduction to the Bayesian calibration problem. Then it reviews the traditional Kriging method for computer code emulation. The authors also give an overview of the GP-based active learning algorithm, which is based on the analysis of the computational cost. They compare the two methods in terms of the computational cost and conclude that the GP-based approach can be more efﬁcient than the traditional one.

**Results/Data**

The paper does not contain any new results. The authors do not present any data or measurements.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors do not discuss the theoretical or practical implications of their method. They only compare the two methods in terms of the computational cost and conclude that the GP-based approach can be more efﬁcient than the traditional one. This is the only thing they are concerned about. The paper does not contain any discussion on the limitations of this work.
