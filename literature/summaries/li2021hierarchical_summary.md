Title: Hierarchical Stochastic Scheduling of Multi-Community Integrated Energy Systems Based on Stackelberg Game

Abstract:

With the goal of investigating a situation involving multi-energy interaction and co-supply by a multi-community integrated energy system, this study investigated a hierarchical stochastic scheduling method based on the Stackelberg game in an uncertain environment. A generative adversarial network (GAN) was used to generate renewable energy output scenarios, and clustering with Kmeans++ was used to obtain typical scenarios. With the multi-community integrated energy system operator as the leader and each building user as each follower, a single-master multiple-slave hierarchical stochastic scheduling model is established,  and determined a balanced interaction strategy using the proposed distributed solution algorithm. Finally, an actual calculation example verified the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Overview/Summary:
The paper proposes a novel approach for the multi-community integrated energy system (MCIES) to deal with the uncertainty of renewable energy output in the presence of multiple-energy interactions. The main contributions are as follows: 1) In view of the impact of renewable energy output uncertainty on optimal scheduling, this study used a data-driven scenario analysis method and a generative adversarial network (GAN) to conduct an in-depth exploration of wind and solar output characteristics to generate wind and solar output scenarios, which avoided the assumption that the output obeyed a specific probability distribution,  and thereby improved the practicality of the method. 2) In the established single-master multiple-slave game model, an MCIES operator guided users to adjust their energy consumption plans through energy sales prices, which achieved peak-shaving and valley-filling effects, smoothed the load curve, and reduced user costs while ensuring user comfort.  In addition, through the introduction of multi-energy interaction, the economy of the MCIES was further improved. 3) A theoretical analysis proved that the proposed Stackelberg game model had a unique S E solution, which was found using the proposed distributed iterative solution method based on a metaheuristic. The results showed that the proposed algorithm had good convergence.

Methodology/Approach:
The paper proposes a hierarchical stochastic scheduling approach for the MCIES in an uncertain environment.  A generative adversarial network (GAN) is used to generate renewable energy output scenarios, and clustering with Kmeans++ was used to obtain typical scenarios. With the multi-community integrated energy system operator as the leader and each building user as each follower, a single-master multiple-slave hierarchical stochastic scheduling model is established,  and determined a balanced interaction strategy using the proposed distributed solution algorithm. Finally, an actual calculation example verified the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Results/Data:
The paper proposes a novel approach for the MCIES to deal with the uncertainty of renewable energy output in the presence of multiple-energy interactions.  The main contributions are as follows: 1) In view of the impact of renewable energy output uncertainty on optimal scheduling, this study used a data-driven scenario analysis method and a GAN to conduct an in-depth exploration of wind and solar output characteristics to generate wind and solar output scenarios, which avoided the assumption that the output obeyed a specific probability distribution,  and thereby improved the practicality of the method. 2) In the established single-master multiple-slave game model, an MCIES operator guided users to adjust their energy consumption plans through energy sales prices, which achieved peak-shaving and valley-filling effects, smoothed the load curve, and reduced user costs while ensuring user comfort.

The results showed that the proposed algorithm had good convergence.

Limitations/Discussion:
The paper does not consider the situations in which different community integrates.  The study of this paper can be extended by considering the internal energy interaction between CIESs and the demand response capability of building users,  and the relationship between building users and MCIES through a Stackelberg game.  In addition, the paper only considered the situation that the MCIES operator had the same energy price in different scenarios,  but the actual situation is that the energy prices may be different in different scenarios.  The study of this paper can also be extended by considering the demand response capability of building users and the relationship between building users and MCIES through a Stackelberg game.
