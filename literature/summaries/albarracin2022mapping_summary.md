**Overview/Summary**
The paper "Mapping Husserlian phenomenology onto active inference" by Albarracin et al. (2022) is a thought-provoking work that bridges the gap between two seemingly disparate research traditions, namely, the philosophical framework of Edmund Husserl's phenomenology and the neurocomputational theory of predictive coding. The authors' primary goal is to provide an account of how the former can be mapped onto the latter by using the active inference (AI) framework, which is a statistical model that has been widely used in recent years to understand brain function. To this end, they first present a general AI model and then describe its application to a specific example from Husserl's phenomenology, namely, his concept of protention. The authors' primary motivation for the paper is not only to provide an account of how the two frameworks can be mapped onto each other but also to show that this mapping provides a new perspective on understanding the nature of consciousness and the mind-body problem.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The main contribution of the paper is the development of a general AI model. The authors' first step in this direction is to provide an account of how Husserl's concept of protention can be understood within the framework of AI. This is achieved by using the AI model and its application to the example of protention as the primary means for understanding the nature of consciousness and the mind-body problem. The authors' second contribution is that this mapping provides a new perspective on understanding these issues, which is not only an account of how the two frameworks can be mapped onto each other but also a demonstration of the potential for this to provide new insights into the nature of consciousness and the mind-body problem.

**Methodology/Approach**
The authors' approach in the paper is to use the AI model as the primary means for understanding the nature of consciousness and the mind-body problem. The first step in this direction is to develop a general AI model, which is then used to provide an account of how Husserl's concept of protention can be understood within the framework of AI. The authors' second approach is that this mapping provides a new perspective on understanding these issues.

**Results/Data**
The results section of the paper is the description of the application of the general AI model to the example of protention. This includes the explanation of how the AI model is used to understand the nature of protention and the mind-body problem. The authors' primary finding from this mapping is that it provides a new perspective on understanding these issues.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The authors' discussion section of the paper is primarily focused on the potential for the mapping between the two frameworks to provide new insights into the nature of consciousness and the mind-body problem. This includes the explanation of how this mapping can be used to understand the nature of protention, which is a central concept in Husserl's phenomenology.

**References**
The references section of the paper contains the list of all the papers cited in the text. The authors' primary reference is the book "Cartesian meditations: An introduction to phenomenology" by Edmund Husserl (2013). The other references are the books and articles that are used as a basis for the authors' discussion of the nature of protention, which is the central concept in this paper.

**Limitations/Weaknesses**
The primary weakness of the paper is that it does not provide an account of how the two frameworks can be mapped onto each other. The authors do not explain why the AI model should be used to understand the nature of consciousness and the mind-body problem, which is a central question in this paper.

**Future Work/Recommendations**
The primary recommendation for future work is that the authors' mapping between the two frameworks provides new insights into the nature of protention. This includes the explanation of how the AI model can be used to understand the nature of consciousness and the mind-body problem, which are central issues in this paper.
