**Overview/Summary**
The paper proposes a data-driven distributionally robust scheduling (DRO) model for coordinating the energy storage system and electric boiler in a community building with renewable generation (RG). The DRO model is designed to minimize the total cost of the CIES, which includes the costs of electricity purchase, grid sales, MTG output, ESS charging and discharging. A data-driven approach is used to obtain the distributionally robust optimal scheduling strategy for the CIES in typical RG scenarios. First, a two-stage optimization framework is proposed based on the scenario-based chance-constrained programming (SCCP). The first stage is to determine the probability of each scenario and the second one is to find the optimal scheduling scheme for each scenario. Then, the distributionally robust optimal scheduling strategy is obtained by using the distributionally robust optimization model. Finally, the DRO model is used to analyze the results of CIES in typical scenarios.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The main contributions of this paper are two-fold. The first one is that a data-driven approach is introduced to obtain the distributionally robust optimal scheduling strategy for the CIES in typical RG scenarios. Second, the DRO model is used to analyze the results of CIES in typical scenarios.

**Methodology/Approach**
The proposed DRO model is based on the scenario-based chance-constrained programming (SCCP). The first stage is to determine the probability of each scenario and the second one is to find the optimal scheduling scheme for each scenario. Then, the distributionally robust optimal scheduling strategy is obtained by using the distributionally robust optimization model.

**Results/Data**
The results of CIES in typical scenarios are analyzed. It can be seen from Fig. 8 that, in terms of electric energy, in the periods when the RG outputs were sufficient, the electric load was entirely supplied by renewable energy (e.g., the 9:00-16:00 periods in Scenarios 1 and 4). During peak lo ad periods, such as 8:00 -10:00 and 20:00-21:00, the ESS gave priority to release electric energy, but its capacity was limited, so the power vacancy also need ed to be satisfied by the MTG and grid. According to the scheduling results, the power generation and purchase costs of the CIES were reduced on the basis of prioritizing RGs consumption, and the bidirectional energy flow of the ESS also reduced the power supply pressure, which in turn decreased the electricity curtailment rate, thereby effectively achieving a more economical system operation. It can be seen from Fig. 9 that, in terms of heat energy, the total heat load was satisfied by the MTG and EB. During most of the daytime, the MTG was put into operation to compensate for the power gap of RG. The heat load was mainly borne by the MTG power-supply waste heat in co-generation mode. During the night time, the heat load was basically supplied by the EB. Given that the electric load was in the valley period but the heat load was at the peak period, the heat supply of the MTG was insufficient, and the heat load could only be borne by the EB. In addition, HSD, as a buffer device, also plays an important role in the balance of heat supply and demand.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The DRO model is used to analyze the results of CIES in typical scenarios. It can be seen that, in terms of electric energy, in the periods when the RG outputs were sufficient, the electric load was entirely supplied by renewable energy (e.g., the 9:00-16:00 periods in Scenarios 1 and 4).
