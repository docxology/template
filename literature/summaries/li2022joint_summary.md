**Overview/Summary**
The paper proposes a joint planning model for distributed generations (DGs) and energy storage in smart grids. The DGs include wind power generation, photovoltaic (PV) generation, and combined heat and power (CHP) units. The energy storage is represented by the battery energy storage system. The objective of this study is to minimize the total cost of the distributed generations, energy storage, and the electricity purchase. The optimization problem is formulated as a bi-level model with the upper level being the planning of the DGs and the lower level being the operation planning in different time periods. The proposed model considers the hourly active power loss of the system. The objective function of the lower level is to minimize the total cost of the distributed generations, energy storage, and the electricity purchase. The optimization problem is solved by using the iterative algorithm based on the Benders decomposition (BD) method. The authors use the iterative BD algorithm to solve the model. The results show that the proposed joint planning model can reduce the total cost compared with the centralized version of the model. The paper also analyzes the impact of the energy storage access capacity and the operation planning in different time periods on the optimization results.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The main contributions of this study are as follows:
1) A joint planning model for DGs and energy storage is proposed, which considers the hourly active power loss of the system. The objective function of the lower level is to minimize the total cost of the distributed generations, energy storage, and the electricity purchase.
2) The optimization problem is solved by using the iterative algorithm based on the Benders decomposition (BD) method. The results show that the proposed joint planning model can reduce the total cost compared with the centralized version of the model.

**Methodology/Approach**
The authors propose a bi-level model for the DGs and energy storage in smart grids. The upper level is the planning of the DGs, which is to determine the capacity and location of the DGs. The lower level is the operation planning in different time periods, which is to minimize the total cost of the distributed generations, energy storage, and the electricity purchase. The authors use the iterative algorithm based on the Benders decomposition (BD) method to solve the model.

**Results/Data**
The results show that the proposed joint planning model can reduce the total cost compared with the centralized version of the model. The paper also analyzes the impact of the energy storage access capacity and the operation planning in different time periods on the optimization results. The authors use the iterative BD algorithm to solve the model. The results are as follows:
1) Wind turbines are available throughout the day, while photovoltaic units are only available at 7-16 pm. 8:00-16:00 is the common period of wind turbine output peak and photovoltaic unit output when the active power network loss of the system is lower than other periods.
2) The energy storage device is charged or keep still in period 0:00-17:00 and discharged in period 18:00-23:00. This shows that the energy storage device, as a controllable power supply, charges in the period of low electricity price and discharges in the period of high electricity price, which conforms to the optimization direction of the lower economic objective function.
3) The active power loss decreases with the increase of the output of DGs.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The authors use the iterative algorithm based on the Benders decomposition (BD) method to solve the model. The results show that the total cost of Tabu search and BPSO are higher than the IBPSO in this paper, and the IBPSO has decreased the duration of calculation by 6~10% compared to other two algorithms, so the IBPSO is adopted in this paper.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The authors compare the different models. The results show that the bi-level optimization model is better than the centralized version of the model in terms of both the cost of each part and the total cost. The authors also analyze the impact of the energy storage access capacity on the optimization results. This study can provide a reference for the planning of DGs and energy storage in smart grids.
