**Overview/Summary**

The paper proposes a self-supervised method for path planning in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided networks. The authors learn a world model from expert demonstrations and employ active inference to enable the UAV to make real-time autonomous decisions and engage in online planning. This means considering future observations, scoring policies based on expected surprises, and anticipating outcomes to empower the UAV to take more effective actions. Simulation results have shown that this method provides quicker adaptation to new situations and better performance than traditional Q-learning, leading to broader generalizability.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors' main contributions are as follows:
- The proposed self-supervised approach is able to learn a world model from expert demonstrations.
- The active inference framework is employed for the UAV to make real-time autonomous decisions and engage in online planning.
- The simulation results show that this method provides quicker adaptation to new situations and better performance than traditional Q-learning, leading to broader generalizability.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors' approach can be summarized as follows:
- The proposed self-supervised method is able to learn a world model from expert demonstrations.
- The active inference framework is employed for the UAV to make real-time autonomous decisions and engage in online planning. This means considering future observations, scoring policies based on expected surprises, and anticipating outcomes to empower the UAV to take more effective actions.

**Results/Data**

The authors' simulation results show that this method provides quicker adaptation to new situations and better performance than traditional Q-learning, leading to broader generalizability. The proposed approach is able to produce words that are more similar to those produced by the optimizer than those 

**Limitations/Discussion**
