**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Human visual exploration reduces uncertainty about the sensed world" by Kiyoshi Nakahara, et al., investigates how human vision works in a complex environment where there are many possible sources of sensory input and the brain is not able to know which one is correct. In this situation, the authors propose that the brain uses an "epistemic affordance" or "salience" (i.e., what is useful for knowing) as a cue to decide which source of information to use. This paper presents a new approach to understanding how people make decisions in complex situations and it can be applied to various fields such as psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, education, economics, etc.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors show that the human visual system is able to reduce uncertainty about the world by using an "epistemic affordance" (i.e., what is useful for knowing) in a complex environment where there are many possible sources of sensory input. The paper presents the first experimental evidence for this idea and it can be applied to various fields such as psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, education, economics, etc.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors used an eye-tracking device to measure how people look at a visual display that contains multiple objects. They manipulated the amount of information available about the location of each object in order to test whether the human visual system is able to reduce uncertainty by using an "epistemic affordance" as a cue. The results show that when there are many possible sources of sensory input, the human visual system uses the most informative source and it can be applied to various fields such as psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, education, economics, etc.

**Results/Data**

The authors found that the human visual system is able to reduce uncertainty about the world by using an "epistemic affordance" (i.e., what is useful for knowing) in a complex environment where there are many possible sources of sensory input. The results show that when there are many possible sources of sensory input, the human visual system uses the most informative source and it can be applied to various fields such as psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, education, economics, etc.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors point out that this paper is the first experimental evidence for the idea that the brain uses an "epistemic affordance" (i.e., what is useful for knowing) and it can be applied to various fields such as psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, education, economics, etc. The authors also mention that there are some limitations in their study. For example, they only used a simple visual display with two objects and the amount of information available about each object was manipulated by using a binary variable (i.e., either 0 or 1). They did not use a continuous variable to manipulate the amount of information. The authors also mention that there are some other limitations in their study.
