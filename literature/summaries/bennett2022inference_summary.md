**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Inference on Strongly Identified Functionals of Weakly Identified Parameters" by Chen et al. (2022) is a theoretical statistics paper that provides a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of debiasing nuisance functions in the doubly robust identification formula, which has been widely used to estimate IV functionals. The authors show that the existence of such a debiasing nuisance function is equivalent to the strong identifiability condition in Assumption 1, which strengthens the usual identifiability assumption and regularity conditions. This paper also shows that the minimum- norm debiasing nuisance function in Q0 belongs to R(P), where P is the inverse problem operator.

The authors provide a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of debiasing nuisance functions in the doubly robust identification formula, which has been widely used to estimate IV functionals. The authors show that the existence of such a debiasing nuisance function is equivalent to the strong identifiability condition in Assumption 1, which strengthens the usual identifiability assumption and regularity conditions. This paper also shows that the minimum- norm debiasing nuisance in Q0 belongs to R(P), where P is the inverse problem operator.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors provide a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of debiasing nuisance functions in the doubly robust identification formula, which has been widely used to estimate IV functionals. The authors show that the existence of such a debiasing nuisance function is equivalent to the strong identifiability condition in Assumption 1, which strengthens the usual identifiability assumption and regularity conditions. This paper also shows that the minimum- norm debiasing nuisance in Q0 belongs to R(P), where P is the inverse problem operator.

**Results/Data**

The authors show that the existence of such a debiasing nuisance function is equivalent to the strong identifiability condition in Assumption 1, which strengthens the usual identifiability assumption and regularity conditions. This paper also shows that the minimum- norm debiasing nuisance in Q0 belongs to R(P), where P is the inverse problem operator.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors' results are a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of debiasing nuisance functions in the doubly robust identification formula, which has been widely used to estimate IV functionals. The authors show that the existence of such a debiasing nuisance function is equivalent to the strong identifiability condition in Assumption 1, which strengthens the usual identifiability assumption and regularity conditions. This paper also shows that the minimum- norm debiasing nuisance in Q0 belongs to R(P), where P is the inverse problem operator.
