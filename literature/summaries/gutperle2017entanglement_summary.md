**Overview/Summary**

The paper is a theoretical work in the context of AdS/CFT correspondence. The authors discuss the free energy and entanglement entropy for IIB theory on an AdS6 background with a quiver gauge group G, where the latter is a sub-group of the SU(N) R-symmetry. The main results are the expressions for the free energy F and the entanglement entropy S in terms of the volume V of the AdS6 space. These quantities are calculated in the large N limit by using the matrix model that arises from the supersymmetric localization. In this paper, the authors consider the cases where G is a maximal parabolic subgroup of SU(N) (the "trivial" case), and also the cases where G is a non-maximal parabolic subgroup of SU(N). The main result in the latter case is the formula for the free energy F which is not known before. In this paper, the authors use the matrix model to calculate the free energy F and the entanglement entropy S. They compare these two quantities and find that they are different. This difference is a new feature of the IIB theory.
