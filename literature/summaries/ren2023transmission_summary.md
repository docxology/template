**Overview/Summary**

The paper is concerned with the design of a transmission scheme for active RIS (Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface)-aided MISO (Multiple-Input Single-Output) communications. The authors consider an MISO system where the transmitter and the receiver are equipped with one antenna each, while the RIS has $N$ antennas. In this paper, the authors propose a transmission design for the active RIS-aided MISO systems based on the statistical channel state information (CSI). The authors first analyze the optimal SWIPT (Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer) in the RIS-aided MISO system with perfect CSI. Then, they consider the case where the RIS has imperfect cascaded channels. In this case, the authors propose a transmission design for the active RIS-aided MISO systems based on the statistical CSI. The authors also compare the performance of the active and passive RIS in terms of the same power budget. Simulation results demonstrate that the active RIS-aided SWIPT system can achieve better performance than the passive RIS/AF relay-aided SWIPT system.
