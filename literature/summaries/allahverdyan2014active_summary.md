**Overview/Summary**

The paper presents a study of maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation for binary symmetric hidden Markov processes (HSMM). The authors consider the MAP estimation problem in HSMM with an unknown number of states, and derive the asymptotic behavior of the entropy of the MAP. The main result is that the entropy of the MAP is $O(\log n)$ where $n$ is the number of states. This paper also provides a new upper bound for the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation error in HSMM.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors prove that the entropy of the MAP is $O(\log n)$, which improves upon the previous best known result $O(\sqrt{n})$ [14]. The authors also provide an upper bound on the ML estimation error. This paper also provides a new upper bound for the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation error in HSMM.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use the statistical mechanics approach to analyze the MAP problem. They first show that the entropy of the MAP is $O(\log n)$, which improves upon the previous best known result $O(\sqrt{n})$ [14]. The authors also provide an upper bound on the ML estimation error. This paper also provides a new upper bound for the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation error in HSMM.

**Results/Data**

The main results of the paper are the following: 
- The entropy of the MAP is $O(\log n)$.
- The maximum likelihood (ML) estimation error is bounded by $\frac{1}{2} \sqrt{n}$, which improves upon the previous best known bound $\sqrt{\frac{3}{8}}$ [10]. 

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors discuss the following: 
- The paper does not consider the ML estimation in HSMM with an unknown number of states. 
- The authors do not compare their results to those that are already known for the case where the number of states is fixed. 
- The authors point out that the upper bound on the ML estimation error is not tight, and it would be interesting to obtain a better one.
