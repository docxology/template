**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Variational Free Energy and Economics Optimizing With Biases" is a theoretical work in the field of economics that uses the variational free energy principle to describe how complex organic systems optimize while simultaneously being free to violate the standard assumptions of rational choice theory. The authors argue that the traditional assumption of maximizing expected utility (EU) is not sufficient for understanding real-world decision-making, and instead propose an alternative approach based on a "variational" optimization problem. This paper is organized as follows.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this work are twofold. First, it provides the first formalization of the variational free energy principle in economics. Second, it uses this framework to describe how people make decisions under uncertainty and ambiguity. The authors show that the standard assumptions of rational choice theory can be derived from the more general framework of the variational optimization problem.

**Methodology/Approach**

The paper starts by introducing the basic concepts of the variational free energy principle in economics, which is based on a "variational" optimization problem. This is a problem where the goal is to find an action sequence that minimizes the expected complexity (EC) of the system. The authors show how this is equivalent to the standard EU maximization problem under certain conditions. They also provide some examples of the variational free energy principle in economics, such as the case where the agent has a "bias" for one option over another.

**Results/Data**

The main result of the paper is that the traditional assumptions of rational choice theory can be derived from the more general framework of the variational optimization problem. The authors show how this is equivalent to the standard EU maximization problem under certain conditions. This is done by using an example where the agent has a "bias" for one option over another.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The paper does not discuss any limitations or future work, but it does provide some examples of the variational free energy principle in economics. The authors also mention that this framework can be used to explain why people make decisions under uncertainty and ambiguity. This is because the EU maximization problem assumes a complete lack of information about the environment, which is not realistic. In contrast, the variational optimization problem allows for some information about the environment. The authors show how this is equivalent to the standard EU maximization problem under certain conditions.
