**Overview/Summary**

The paper presents a novel dual-layer Active Inference (AIF) framework for building community energy management. The AIF is an inference-based approach that infers the underlying causes of observations and ensures that the performance targets are tracked. Two distinct AIF models were developed: a continuous model to control HVAC operations at the building level and a discrete model to coordinate power flows, battery usage, and external market interactions at the community level. The first layer tries to infer its respective hidden states from observations and ensure that the performance targets are tracked and achieved. At the community level, the ambiguity term plays a significant role in balancing uncertainties with achieving short-term benefits. The results show the same or superior performance by the AIF framework compared to exact optimization under full observations and with RL under similar partial observations.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The first layer of the AIF is designed for HVAC control at the building level, which tries to infer its respective hidden states from observations and ensure that the performance targets are tracked and achieved. The second layer of the AIF is designed for community energy management, which coordinates power flows, battery usage, and external market interactions. It also infers its respective hidden states from observations and ensures that the performance targets are tracked and achieved. The first layer tries to infer its respective hidden states from observations and ensure that the performance targets are tracked and achieved. At the community level, the ambiguity term plays a significant role in balancing uncertainties with achieving short-term benefits. The results show the same or superior performance by the AIF framework compared to exact optimization under full observations and with RL under similar partial observations.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The formulation is quite generic and, under some mild assumptions, can be extended to communities with a larger number of buildings and zones within buildings.
