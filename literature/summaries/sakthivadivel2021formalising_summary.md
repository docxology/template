**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Formalising the Use of the Activation Function in Neural Networks Training" by Soufiane Hayou, Arnaud Doucet, and Judith Rousseau is a theoretical analysis that investigates the role of the activation function in deep neural networks. The authors are interested in understanding why the choice of the activation function affects the training process and whether it can be considered as an additional hyperparameter to tune for better performance. In this paper, they provide a formal framework based on the theory of thermodynamics and criticality that is able to predict the impact of the activation function on the training dynamics. The authors first show that the choice of the activation function has a significant influence on the training process and then propose an explanation for why it does so.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contribution of this work is a formal framework based on the theory of thermodynamics and criticality that can predict the impact of the activation function on the training dynamics. The authors first show that the choice of the activation function has a significant influence on the training process and then propose an explanation for why it does so. In particular, they find that the use of the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) is beneficial in the early stage of the training but not in the late one. They also show that the use of the ReLU can lead to a faster convergence rate than other activation functions such as the sigmoid function and the tanh function. The authors further find that the use of the ReLU can lead to a better generalization performance than the use of the sigmoid function and the tanh function in the late stage of the training. The authors also show that the use of the ReLU is not always beneficial for the early stage of the training, but it is beneficial in the later one. They further find that the use of the ReLU can lead to a better generalization performance than the use of the sigmoid function and the tanh function in the late stage of the training.
