**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Deep Active Learning for Dialogue Generation" by Li et al. (2017) is a seminal work in the field of deep learning and dialogue generation. The authors propose an end-to-end trainable neural network approach to generate responses that are coherent, natural, and engaging. They argue that current approaches to dialogue generation do not use the full capacity of the available data for training because they are based on hand-crafted rules or templates. In this paper, the authors introduce a novel deep learning framework called Deep Active Learning (DAL) that can learn from the entire dataset without any human intervention. The main idea is to train a neural network in an online manner by asking questions and answering them. The training process is conducted in two stages: first, the model learns to generate responses based on the input context; second, it learns to ask follow-up questions based on the generated response. The authors show that this approach can be used for both task-oriented dialogue generation and open-domain conversation.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this paper are:

1. **Deep Active Learning (DAL)**: The proposed DAL is a novel training framework that can learn from the entire dataset without any human intervention. It is based on an online learning process by asking questions and answering them.
2. **Two-stage Training**: The authors propose a two-stage training approach for the DAL, where the first stage is to train a neural network in generating responses based on the input context; the second stage is to train the model to ask follow-up questions based on the generated response. The training process of the first stage is conducted by using the entire dataset as the training set and the validation set. The training process of the second stage is conducted by using the validation set as the training set, and the test set as the validation set.
3. **Diverse Beam Search**: A new beam search algorithm called Diverse Beam Search (DBS) is proposed to generate diverse responses from a neural network. It can be used for both task-oriented dialogue generation and open-domain conversation.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors propose an end-to-end trainable neural network approach that can learn from the entire dataset without any human intervention. The training process of the first stage is conducted by using the entire dataset as the training set and the validation set. The training process of the second stage is conducted by using the validation set as the training set, and the test set as the validation set.

**Results/Data**

* **Task-Oriented Dialogue Generation**: The authors conduct experiments on the Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus. They compare their approach with the baseline approaches, including the sequence-to-sequence model, the neural conversational model, and the reinforcement learning based approach. The results show that the proposed approach outperforms the baselines in terms of the task-oriented dialogue generation.
* **Open-Domain Conversation**: The authors conduct experiments on the Cornell Movie Dialog Corpus (CMU). They compare their approach with the baseline approaches, including the sequence-to-sequence model and the reinforcement learning based approach. The results show that the proposed approach outperforms the baselines in terms of the open-domain conversation.
