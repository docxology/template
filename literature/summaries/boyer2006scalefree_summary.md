**Overview/Summary**
The authors of this paper investigate the foraging behavior of primates and find that it is scale-free, meaning that the frequency distribution of the sojourn time at a tree (the time spent by an animal before moving to another) is independent of the size of the target. The authors also show that the mean displacement of the primate as a function of time follows a power law with an exponent of 3/2, which is the same value found in the Lévy walk model. This paper uses a simple random walk model to explain these results. A sojourn time distribution is given for the different variants of the model and the mean displacement of the model walker as a function of time is also provided.

**Key Contributions/Findings**
The authors find that the frequency distribution of the size of the target visited by the primate (or the random walk) and the waiting time at each tree are both power laws with exponents 3 and 2, respectively. The mean displacement of the model walker as a function of time is also given for different variants of the model. These results are compared to the Lévy walk model which has the same value of the exponent for the sojourn time distribution (2) and the mean displacement (3/2). The authors find that the waiting time at each tree follows an inverse power law with an exponent 1.7, while the size of the target visited by the primate is a power law with an exponent 3.0. This paper also provides the frequency distribution of the sojourn length and the mean displacement as a function of time for the different variants of the model.

**Methodology/Approach**
The authors use a simple random walk model to explain the results from the field observations of the primate. The size of the target visited by the primate is given by the probability distribution P(k) where k is the size of the target. The waiting time at each tree is given by the probability distribution w(τ). The authors also give the mean displacement R(t) as a function of time t, which is the average distance traveled by the random walk from its starting point to the end of the walk at time t. The authors compare the results from the model with the Lévy walk model and find that they are the same.

**Results/Data**
The size distribution of the target visited by the primate (or the random walk) is given in Figure 3a, which shows a power law with an exponent 3.0. The waiting time at each tree is also a power law with an exponent 1.7 as shown in Figure 3(a). The mean displacement R(t) of the model walker as a function of time t is given in Figure 4 for different variants of the model, which are described in the Appendix. The authors find that the waiting time at each tree follows an inverse power law with an exponent 1.7, while the size of the target visited by the primate is a power law with an exponent 3.0. This paper also provides the frequency distribution of the sojourn length and the mean displacement as a function of time for the different variants of the model.

**Limitations/Discussion**
The authors find that the waiting time at each tree follows an inverse power law with an exponent 1.7, while the size of the target visited by the primate is a power law with an exponent 3.0. The authors also provide the frequency distribution of the sojourn length and the mean displacement as a function of time for the different variants of the model. This paper does not discuss the limitations or future work.
