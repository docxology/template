**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Fighting seizures with seizures: diffusion and stability in neural networks" by S. P. et al. (2022) investigates the role of the excitatory-inhibitory balance in the development of seizure-like activity in a model of a cortical network, where the activity is represented as a mean-field field theory. The authors show that the onset of the seizure-like activity is associated with an imbalance between excitation and inhibition, which is corrected by the same mechanism that causes the seizure-like activity. This is reminiscent of the "fighting fire with fire" paradox in the context of the Kuramoto model for the collective dynamics of a population of coupled phase oscillators. The authors also show that the onset of the seizure-like activity is associated with an increase in the mean-field value, which is not the case for the Kuramoto model. This paper provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying the development and correction of seizure-like activity, and may be useful for understanding the role of the excitatory-inhibitory balance in the brain.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The authors show that the onset of the seizure-like activity is associated with an increase in the mean-field value. The authors also provide a new explanation for the "fighting fire with fire" paradox, which has been observed in the Kuramoto model. This paper may be useful for understanding the role of the excitatory-inhibitory balance in the brain.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors use the mean-field field theory to study the collective behavior of a population of coupled phase oscillators. The authors show that the onset of the seizure-like activity is associated with an increase in the mean-field value, which is not the case for the Kuramoto model. This paper may be useful for understanding the role of the excitatory-inhibitory balance in the brain.

**Results/Data**

The authors use the mean-field field theory to study the collective behavior of a population of coupled phase oscillators. The authors show that the onset of the seizure-like activity is associated with an increase in the mean-field value, which is not the case for the Kuramoto model. This paper may be useful for understanding the role of the excitatory-inhibitory balance in the brain.

**Limitations/Discussion**

The authors discuss the limitations and future work of their research. The authors also provide a new explanation for the "fighting fire with fire" paradox, which has been observed in the Kuramoto model. This paper may be useful for understanding the role of the excitatory-inhibitory balance in the brain.
