**Overview/Summary**

The paper proposes a framework for transmission design in active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) systems and provides a lower bound on the average achievable rate of RIS-aided systems with imperfect channel state information (CSI). The authors consider an active RIS system, where the RIS is composed of N sub-RISs, each having M elements. The RIS is used to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and beamforming gain at a single-user receiver. The paper focuses on the ergodic achievable rate of the RIS-aided systems when the RIS-aided channels follow a Rayleigh distribution or a Rician distribution with a non-line-of-sight (NLoS) component, and the RIS is used to enhance the SNR and beamforming gain at a single-user receiver. The authors propose an active RIS system, where the RIS is composed of N sub-RISs, each having M elements.
