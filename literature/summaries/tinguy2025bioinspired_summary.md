**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Bio-Insipired Topological Autonomous Navigation with Active Inference" presents a novel approach to autonomous navigation in large-scale environments by exploiting the structure of the environment and the agent's goal. The authors propose an active inference framework for exploration, which is based on the idea that the agent can use its own uncertainty as a source of information about the environment. The proposed method is tested in the Minigrid environment, where the agent must explore to find a target location. The results show that the active inference approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methods and achieves higher efficiency than the baseline.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The main contributions of this paper are:

1. **A novel exploration strategy based on an active inference framework**: The authors propose a new method for autonomous navigation, which is based on the idea that the agent can use its own uncertainty as a source of information about the environment. This approach is different from previous works that rely on the structure of the environment or the goal.
2. **An efficient exploration strategy in Minigrid environment**: The authors test their proposed method in the Minigrid environment, where the agent must explore to find a target location. The results show that the active inference approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methods and achieves higher efficiency than the baseline.

**Methodology/Approach**

The authors first introduce the concept of topological autonomous navigation (TAN), which is based on the idea that the agent can use its own uncertainty as a source of information about the environment. The TAN framework consists of two main components: the **goal-oriented semantic exploration** and the **goal-directed path planning**. The goal-oriented semantic exploration is to find the most informative subgraph in the graph, which is used to represent the environment. In this step, the authors use a graph-based representation of the environment, where each node represents a state and the edges represent the transition between two states. Then, the agent can choose an action based on its current belief about the environment. The goal-directed path planning is to find a path from the current state to the target location. In this step, the authors use the **Voxblox** algorithm for 3D mapping and the **Fael** algorithm for fast autonomous exploration.
