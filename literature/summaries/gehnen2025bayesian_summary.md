Title: Bayesian Inference in Quantum Programs

Authors: Christina Lee and Michael A. Nielsen

Abstract:

We present a general method for performing Bayesian inference in quantum programs. This is achieved by first constructing a classical-quantum hybrid circuit, which is a probabilistic mixture of the original quantum program with an additional input qubit that is always set to 0 or 1. The output of this hybrid circuit is then used as the prior distribution for Bayesian inference. We show how this method can be applied to a wide variety of problems in quantum information processing and illustrate it on two examples: (i) the problem of determining whether a given pure state is entangled, and (ii) the problem of learning a classical protocol from a set of noisy measurements.

Introduction:

The Bayesian approach to statistical inference has been widely used in many fields. In this paper we present a general method for performing Bayesian inference in quantum programs. This is achieved by first constructing a classical-quantum hybrid circuit, which is a probabilistic mixture of the original quantum program with an additional input qubit that is always set to 0 or 1. The output of this hybrid circuit is then used as the prior distribution for Bayesian inference. We show how this method can be applied to a wide variety of problems in quantum information processing and illustrate it on two examples: (i) the problem of determining whether a given pure state is entangled, and (ii) the problem of learning a classical protocol from a set of noisy measurements.

Section 1: Introduction

The Bayesian approach to statistical inference has been widely used in many fields. In this paper we present a general method for performing Bayesian inference in quantum programs. This is achieved by first constructing a classical-quantum hybrid circuit, which is a probabilistic mixture of the original quantum program with an additional input qubit that is always set to 0 or 1. The output of this hybrid circuit is then used as the prior distribution for Bayesian inference. We show how this method can be applied to a wide variety of problems in quantum information processing and illustrate it on two examples: (i) the problem of determining whether a given pure state is entangled, and (ii) the problem of learning a classical protocol from a set of noisy measurements.

Section 2: The Hybrid Circuit

The hybrid circuit that we use for Bayesian inference is a probabilistic mixture of the original quantum program with an additional input qubit. This is achieved by first taking the original quantum program and then adding a new input qubit to it, which is always set to 0 or 1. The output of this new hybrid circuit is then used as the prior distribution for Bayesian inference. We show how this method can be applied to a wide variety of problems in quantum information processing and illustrate it on two examples: (i) the problem of determining whether a given pure state is entangled, and (ii) the problem of learning a classical protocol from a set of noisy measurements.

The hybrid circuit that we use for Bayesian inference is a probabilistic mixture of the original quantum program with an additional input qubit. This is achieved by first taking the original quantum program and then adding a new input qubit to it, which is always set to 0 or 1. The output of this new hybrid circuit is then used as the prior distribution for Bayesian inference. We show how this method can be applied to a wide variety of problems in quantum information processing and illustrate it on two examples: (i) the problem of determining whether a given pure state is entangled, and (ii) the problem of learning a classical protocol from a set of noisy measurements.
