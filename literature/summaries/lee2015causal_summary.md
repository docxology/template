**Overview/Summary**

The paper "Causal inference via algebraic geometry: feasibility tests" by Kockanath Sreekumar and Michael Cade addresses the problem of testing whether a given set of observational data is compatible with a particular functional causal structure, where the number of observed variables is two. The authors' main contribution is to provide a general framework for this problem that can be applied in any dimension. This paper provides an overview of the main results and ideas from the original work.

**Key Contributions/Findings**

The key contributions are the feasibility tests for different functional causal structures, which are the main results of the paper. The authors' approach is to consider a set of conditional independence statements that must be true if the data are 

**Methodology/Approach**

**Results/Data**

The main results of the paper are the feasibility tests for different functional causal structures. These are the minimal ones in the sense that if the data are 

**Limitations/Discussion**
