      "abstract": "Active inference (AI) is a persuasive theoretical framework from computational neuroscience that seeks to describe action and perception as inference-based computation. However, this framework has yet to provide practical sensorimotor control algorithms that are competitive with alternative approaches. In this work, we frame active inference through the lens of control as inference (CaI), a body of work that presents trajectory optimization as inference. From the wider view of `probabilistic numerics', CaI offers principled, numerically robust optimal control solvers that provide uncertainty quantification, and can scale to nonlinear problems with approximate inference. We show that AI may be framed as partially-observed CaI when the cost function is defined specifically in the observation states.",

      "abstract": "Active inference offers a principled account of behavior as minimizing average sensory surprise over time. Applications of active inference to control problems have heretofore tended to focus on finite-horizon or discounted-surprise problems, despite deriving from the infinite-horizon, average-surprise imperative of the free-energy principle. Here we derive an infinite-horizon, average-surprise formulation of active inference from optimal control principles. Our formulation returns to the roots of active inference in neuroanatomy and neurophysiology, formally reconnecting active inference to optimal feedback control. Our formulation provides a unified objective functional for sensorimotor control and allows for reference states to vary over time.",

      "abstract": "An open question in the study of emergent behaviour in multi-agent Bayesian systems is the relationship, if any, between individual and collective inference. In this paper we explore the correspondence between generative models that exist at two distinct scales, using spin glass models as a sandbox system to investigate this question. We show that the collective dynamics of a specific type of active inference agent is equivalent to sampling from the stationary distribution of a spin glass system. A collective of specifically-designed active inference agents can thus be described as implementing a form of sampling-based inference (namely, from a Boltzmann machine) at the higher level. However, this equivalence is very fragile, breaking upon simple modifications to the generative models of the individual agents or the nature of their interactions. We discuss the implications of this correspondence and its fragility for the study of multiscale systems composed of Bayesian agents.",

Although significant progress has been made in each of these areas independently, the best way to integrate them is an open research question. In this paper, we propose the integration of a statistical model of cognitive map formation within an active inference agent that supports planning under uncertainty. Specifically, we examine the clone-structured cognitive graph (CSCG) model of cognitive map formation and compare a naive clone graph agent with an active inference-driven clone graph agent, in three spatial navigation scenarios. Our findings demonstrate that while both agents are effective in simple scenarios, the active inference agent is more effective when planning in challenging scenarios, in which sensory observations provide ambiguous information about location.",

The survey data will allow us to measure the dark energy and dark matter densities and the dark energy equation of state through four independent methods: galaxy clusters, weak gravitational lensing tomography, galaxy angular clustering, and supernova distances. These methods are doubly complementary: they constrain different combinations of cosmological model parameters and are subject to different systematic errors. By deriving the four sets of measurements from the same data set with a common analysis framework, we will obtain important cross checks of the systematic errors and thereby make a substantial and robust advance in the precision of dark energy measurements.",

It provides an overview of dark energy science and describes the current and anticipated state of the field. It makes the case for the DESC by laying out a robust analytical framework for dark energy science that has been defined by its members and the comprehensive three-year work plan they have developed for implementing that framework. The analysis working groups cover five key probes of dark energy: weak lensing, large scale structure, galaxy clusters, Type Ia supernovae, and strong lensing. The computing working groups span cosmological simulations, galaxy catalogs, photon simulations and a systematic software and computational framework for LSST dark energy data analysis. The technical working groups make the connection between dark energy science and the LSST system. The working groups have close linkages, especially through the use of the photon simulations to study the impact of instrument design and survey strategy on analysis methodology and cosmological parameter estimation. The white paper describes several high priority tasks identified by each of the 16 working groups. Over the next three years these tasks will help prepare for LSST analysis, make synergistic connections with ongoing cosmological surveys and provide the dark energy community with state of the art analysis tools. Members of the community are invited to join the LSST DESC, according to the membership policies described in the white paper. Applications to sign up for associate membership may be made by submitting the Web form at http://www.slac.stanford.edu/exp/lsst/desc/signup.html with a short statement of the work they wish to pursue that is relevant to the LSST DESC.",

In this basic model we will separate how we learn from Ignorance, and how we anticipate the world using Bayes formula, both should however be more entangled to best reflect reality. In fact, as we have seen after achieving this work, applying Ignorance on the system constituting a person finally turns out to be the global approach of its local counterpart on systems like neurons, cells and other complex probabilistic systems, described using the free energy principle, a much more complex and detailed approach. The aim of this article is therefore to show, as seen from a person, another aspect of the application of the free energy principle which represents the constrained Shannon's entropy, and leads to Bayes'formula. We show that, using only ignorance as a single quantity, and its minimization as the main process, we can take into account his understandings, assertions, doubts and assumptions about how he perceives the world, by describing them mathematically.",

      "abstract": "An open problem in artificial intelligence is how systems can flexibly learn discrete abstractions that are useful for solving inherently continuous problems. Previous work in computational neuroscience has considered this functional integration of discrete and continuous variables during decision-making under the formalism of active inference (Parr, Friston & de Vries, 2017; Parr & Friston, 2018). However, their focus is on the expressive physical implementation of categorical decisions and the hierarchical mixed generative model is assumed to be known. As a consequence, it is unclear how this framework might be extended to learning. We therefore present a novel hierarchical hybrid active inference agent in which a high-level discrete active inference planner sits above a low-level continuous active inference controller. We make use of recent work in recurrent switching linear dynamical systems (rSLDS) which implement end-to-end learning of meaningful discrete representations via the piecewise linear decomposition of complex continuous dynamics (Linderman et al., 2016). The representations learned by the rSLDS inform the structure of the hybrid decision-making agent and allow us to (1) specify temporally-abstracted sub-goals in a method reminiscent of the options framework, (2) lift the exploration into discrete space allowing us to exploit information-theoretic exploration bonuses and (3) `cache' the approximate solutions to low-level problems in the discrete planner. We apply our model to the sparse Continuous Mountain Car task, demonstrating fast system identification via enhanced exploration and successful planning through the delineation of abstract sub-goals.",

      "abstract": "This work presents a fault-tolerant control scheme for sensory faults in robotic manipulators based on active inference. In the majority of existing schemes, a binary decision of whether a sensor is healthy (functional) or faulty is made based on measured data. The decision boundary is called a threshold and it is usually deterministic. Following a faulty decision, fault recovery is obtained by excluding the malfunctioning sensor. We propose a stochastic fault-tolerant scheme based on active inference and precision learning which does not require a priori threshold definitions to trigger fault recovery. Instead, the sensor precision, which represents its health status, is learned online in a model-free way allowing the system to gradually, and not abruptly exclude a failing unit. Experiments on a robotic manipulator show promising results and directions for future work are discussed.",

The aim is to reconnoiter a geographical area to maintain a common operational picture. To achieve this, we construct an evidence map that reflects our current understanding of the situation, incorporating both positive and \"negative\" sensor observations of possible target objects collected over time, and diffusing the evidence across the map as time progresses. The generative model of active inference uses Dempster-Shafer theory and a Gaussian sensor model, which provides input to the agent. The generative process employs a Bayesian approach to update a posterior probability distribution. We calculate the variational free energy for all positions within the area by assessing the divergence between a pignistic probability distribution of the evidence map and a posterior probability distribution of a target object based on the observations, including the level of surprise associated with receiving new observations. Using the free energy, we direct the agents' movements in a simulation by taking an incremental step toward a position that minimizes the free energy. This approach addresses the challenge of exploration and exploitation, allowing agents to balance searching extensive areas of the geographical map while tracking identified target objects.",

However, existing DRL solutions suffer from data inefficiency, insensitivity to latency requirements, and non-adaptability to task load variations, which will degrade the performance of LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on active inference for LLMs inference task offloading and resource allocation in cloud-edge computing.

This model generalises partially observed Markov decision processes to include paths as latent variables, rendering it suitable for active inference and learning in a dynamic setting. Specifically, we consider deep or hierarchical forms using the renormalisation group. The ensuing renormalising generative models (RGM) can be regarded as discrete homologues of deep convolutional neural networks or continuous state-space models in generalised coordinates of motion. By construction, these scale-invariant models can be used to learn compositionality over space and time, furnishing models of paths or orbits; i.e., events of increasing temporal depth and itinerancy. This technical note illustrates the automatic discovery, learning and deployment of RGMs using a series of applications. We start with image classification and then consider the compression and generation of movies and music. Finally, we apply the same variational principles to the learning of Atari-like games.",

Research has identified several cognitive and social functions of narratives that are conducive to well-being and adaptation as well as to coordinated social practices and enculturation. In this paper, we characterize the cognitive and social functions of narratives in terms of active inference, to support the claim that one of the main adaptive functions of narrative is to generate more useful (i.e., accurate, parsimonious) predictions for the individual, as well as to coordinate group action (over multiple timescales) through shared predictions about collective behavior. Active inference is a theory that depicts the fundamental tendency of living organisms to adapt by proactively inferring the causes of their sensations (including their own actions). We review narrative research on identity, event segmentation, episodic memory, future projections, storytelling practices, enculturation, and master narratives. We show how this research dovetails with the active inference framework and propose an account of the cognitive and social functions of narrative that emphasizes that narratives are for the future—even when they are focused on recollecting or recounting the past. Understanding narratives as cognitive and cultural tools for mutual prediction in social contexts can guide research on narrative in adaptive behavior and psychopathology, based on a parsimonious mechanistic model of some of the basic adaptive functions of narrative.",

In this paper, we propose an active inference account of self-esteem, casting it as a sociometer or an inferential capacity to interpret one’s standing within a social group. This approach allows us to explore the interaction between an individual’s self-perception and the expectations of their social environment.When there is a mismatch between these perceptions and expectations, the individual needs to adjust their actions or update their self-perception to better align with their current experiences. We also consider this hypothesis in relation with recent research on affective inference, suggesting that self-esteem enables the individual to track and respond to this discrepancy through affective states such as anxiety or positive affect. By acting as an inferential sociometer, self-esteem allows individuals to navigate and adapt to their social environment, ultimately impacting their psychological well-being and mental health.",

In engineering, the physics behind sensors is often known reasonably accurately and measurement functions can be incorporated into generative models. When a measurement function is non-linear, the transformed variable is typically approximated with a Gaussian distribution to ensure tractable inference. We show that Gaussian approximations that are sensitive to the curvature of the measurement function, such as a second-order Taylor approximation, produce a state-dependent ambiguity term. This induces a preference over states, based on how accurately the state can be inferred from the observation.

This accommodates shifts in the self-other boundary, allowing affect to emerge at individual and dyadic levels. We propose a novel method termed geometric hyperscanning, based on the Forman-Ricci curvature, to empirically operationalize these processes: it tracks topological reconfigurations in inter-brain networks, with its entro-py serving as a proxy for affective phase transitions such as rupture, co-regulation, and re-attunement.",

In contrast to previous optimal feedback control-based models, the agent's actions are selected by minimizing Expected Free Energy, solely based on preference distributions over percepts, such as observing clicking a button correctly. Our results show that the agent creates plausible pointing movements and clicks when the cursor is over the target, with similar end-point variance to human users. In contrast to other models of pointing, we incorporate fully probabilistic, predictive delay compensation into the agent.

In parallel, evidence accumulator models (EAMs) provide a mechanistic account of how effort arises from competition between the subjective values of available options. Although EAMs have been combined with frameworks like Reinforcement Learning to bridge the gap between high-level theories and process-level mechanisms, relatively less attention has been paid to their implications for a unified notion of cognitive effort. Here, we combine Active Inference (AIF) with the Drift-Diffusion Model (DDM) to investigate whether the resulting AIF-DDM can simultaneously account for effort arising from both habit violation and value discriminability. To our knowledge, this is the first time AIF has been combined with an EAM. We tested the AIF-DDM on a behavioral dataset from the two-step task and compared its predictions to an information-theoretic definition of cognitive effort based on AIF. The model's predictions successfully accounted for second-stage reaction times but failed to capture the dynamics of the first stage. We argue the latter discrepancy likely stems from the experimental design rather than a fundamental flaw in the model's assumptions about cognitive effort. Accordingly, we propose several modifications of the two-step task to better measure and isolate cognitive effort. Finally, we found that integrating the DDM significantly improved parameter recovery, which could help future studies to obtain more reliable parameter estimates.",

In this paper, (1) we articulate the distinction between tool discovery and tool innovation by providing a minimal description of the two concepts under the formalism of active inference. We then (2) apply this description to construct a toy model of tool innovation by introducing the notion of tool affordances into the hidden states of the agent's probabilistic generative model.

      "abstract": "Ultrasound (US) has the unique potential to offer access to medical imaging to anyone, everywhere. Devices have become ultra-portable and cost-effective, akin to the stethoscope. Nevertheless US image quality and diagnostic efficacy are still highly operator- and patient-dependent. In difficult-to-image patients, image quality is often insufficient for reliable diagnosis. In this paper, we put forth that US imaging systems can be recast as information-seeking agents that engage in reciprocal interactions with their anatomical environment. Such agents autonomously adapt their transmit-receive sequences to fully personalize imaging and actively maximize information gain in-situ. To that end, we will show that the sequence of pulse-echo experiments that a US system performs can be interpreted as a perception-action loop: the action is the data acquisition, probing tissue with acoustic waves and recording reflections at the detection array, and perception is the inference of the anatomical and or functional state, potentially including associated diagnostic quantities. We then equip systems with a mechanism to actively reduce uncertainty and maximize diagnostic value across a sequence of experiments, treating action and perception jointly using Bayesian inference given generative models of the environment and action-conditional pulse-echo observations. Since the representation capacity of the generative models dictates both the quality of inferred anatomical states and the effectiveness of inferred sequences of future imaging actions, we will be greatly leveraging the enormous advances in deep generative modelling that are currently disrupting many fields and society at large. Finally, we show some examples of cognitive, closed-loop, US systems that perform active beamsteering and adaptive scanline selection, based on deep generative models that track anatomical belief states.",

      "abstract": "Semi-supervised (SS) inference has received much attention in recent years. Apart from a moderate-sized labeled data, L, the SS setting is characterized by an additional, much larger sized, unlabeled data, U. The setting of |U| >> |L|, makes SS inference unique and different from the standard missing data problems, owing to natural violation of the so-called \"positivity\" or \"overlap\" assumption. However, most of the SS literature implicitly assumes L and U to be equally distributed, i.e., no selection bias in the labeling. Inferential challenges in missing at random (MAR) type labeling allowing for selection bias, are inevitably exacerbated by the decaying nature of the propensity score (PS). We address this gap for a prototype problem, the estimation of the response's mean. We propose a double robust SS (DRSS) mean estimator and give a complete characterization of its asymptotic properties. The proposed estimator is consistent as long as either the outcome or the PS model is correctly specified. When both models are correctly specified, we provide inference results with a non-standard consistency rate that depends on the smaller size |L|. The results are also extended to causal inference with imbalanced treatment groups. Further, we provide several novel choices of models and estimators of the decaying PS, including a novel offset logistic model and a stratified labeling model. We present their properties under both high and low dimensional settings. These may be of independent interest. Lastly, we present extensive simulations and also a real data application.",

The question arises why some sets of observables are distinguished by a discontinuity in an inference method which is still discussed as a universal inference method.

      "abstract": "Sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, while outperforming dense Large Language Models (LLMs) in terms of performance, face significant deployment challenges during inference due to their high memory demands. Existing offloading techniques, which involve swapping activated and idle experts between the GPU and CPU, often suffer from rigid expert caching mechanisms. These mechanisms fail to adapt to dynamic routing, leading to inefficient cache utilization, or incur prohibitive costs for prediction training. To tackle these inference-specific challenges, we introduce ExpertFlow, a comprehensive system specifically designed to enhance inference efficiency by accommodating flexible routing and enabling efficient expert scheduling between CPU and GPU. This reduces overhead and boosts system performance. Central to our approach is a predictive routing path-based offloading mechanism that utilizes a lightweight predictor to accurately forecast routing paths before computation begins. This proactive strategy allows for real-time error correction in expert caching, significantly increasing cache hit ratios and reducing the frequency of expert transfers, thereby minimizing I/O overhead. Additionally, we implement a dynamic token scheduling strategy that optimizes MoE inference by rearranging input tokens across different batches. This method not only reduces the number of activated experts per batch but also improves computational efficiency. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that ExpertFlow achieves up to 93.72\\% GPU memory savings and enhances inference speed by 2 to 10 times compared to baseline methods, highlighting its effectiveness and utility as a robust solution for resource-constrained inference scenarios.",

The nodes of the quadrature are sequentially chosen by maximizing a suitable acquisition function, which takes into account the current approximation of the posterior and the positions of the nodes. This maximization does not require additional evaluations of the true posterior. We introduce two specific schemes based on Gaussian and Nearest Neighbors (NN) bases. For the Gaussian case, we also provide a novel procedure for fitting the bandwidth parameter, in order to build a suitable emulator of a density function. With both techniques, we always obtain a positive estimation of the marginal likelihood (a.k.a., Bayesian evidence). An equivalent importance sampling interpretation is also described, which allows the design of extended schemes. Several theoretical results are provided and discussed. Numerical results show the advantage of the proposed approach, including a challenging inference problem in an astronomic dynamical model, with the goal of revealing the number of planets orbiting a star.",

      "abstract": "Active vision, also known as active perception, refers to the process of actively selecting where and how to look in order to gather task-relevant information. It is a critical component of efficient perception and decision-making in humans and advanced embodied agents. Recently, the use of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as central planning and decision-making modules in robotic systems has gained extensive attention. However, despite the importance of active perception in embodied intelligence, there is little to no exploration of how MLLMs can be equipped with or learn active perception capabilities. In this paper, we first provide a systematic definition of MLLM-based active perception tasks. We point out that the recently proposed GPT-o3 model's zoom-in search strategy can be regarded as a special case of active perception; however, it still suffers from low search efficiency and inaccurate region selection. To address these issues, we propose ACTIVE-O3, a purely reinforcement learning based training framework built on top of GRPO, designed to equip MLLMs with active perception capabilities. We further establish a comprehensive benchmark suite to evaluate ACTIVE-O3 across both general open-world tasks, such as small-object and dense object grounding, and domain-specific scenarios, including small object detection in remote sensing and autonomous driving, as well as fine-grained interactive segmentation. In addition, ACTIVE-O3 also demonstrates strong zero-shot reasoning abilities on the V* Benchmark, without relying on any explicit reasoning data. We hope that our work can provide a simple codebase and evaluation protocol to facilitate future research on active perception in MLLMs.",

We present the active neural sensing approach that generates the kinematically feasible viewpoint sequences for the robot manipulator with an in-hand camera to gather the minimum number of observations needed to reconstruct the underlying environment. Our framework actively collects the visual RGBD observations, aggregates them into scene representation, and performs object shape inference to avoid unnecessary robot interactions with the environment. We train our approach on synthetic data with domain randomization and demonstrate its successful execution via sim-to-real transfer in reconstructing narrow, covered, real-world cabinet environments cluttered with unknown objects. The natural cabinet scenarios impose significant challenges for robot motion and scene reconstruction due to surrounding obstacles and low ambient lighting conditions.

Advances in next-generation sequencing enable detailed yet destructive gene expression assays at the single-cell level, resulting in the loss of cell evolutionary trajectories. Due to technological and cost constraints, single-cell experiments often feature cells sampled at irregular and sparse time points with a small sample size. Although trajectory-based structural inference models can accurately reveal the underlying interaction graph from observed data, their efficacy depends on the inputs of thousands of regularly sampled trajectories. The irregularly-sampled nature of single-cell data precludes the direct use of these powerful models for reconstructing GRNs. Optimal transport, a classical mathematical framework that minimize transportation costs between distributions, has shown promise in multi-omics data integration and cell fate prediction. Utilizing OT, our method constructs mappings between consecutively sampled cells to form cell-level trajectories, which are given as input to a structural inference model that recovers the GRN from single-cell data. Through case studies in two synthetic datasets, we demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed method and its promising performance over eight state-of-the-art GRN inference methods.",

Here, we introduce a minimal model that integrates self-propulsion into the active nematic framework. Our linear stability analyses reveal how self-propulsion shifts the onset of instability, fundamentally altering the dynamical landscape. Numerical simulations confirm these predictions, showing that self-propulsion induces anti-hyperuniform fluctuations, anomalous long-range order in vorticity, and non-universal self-similar energy cascades. Notably, these long-range ordered states emerge within the active turbulence regime well before the transition to a flocking state. Additionally, our analyses highlight a non-monotonic dependence of self-organization on self-propulsion, with optimal states characterized by a peak in correlation length. These findings are relevant for understanding of active nematic systems that self-propel, such as migrating cell layers or swarming bacteria, and offer new avenues for designing synthetic systems with tailored collective behaviours, bridging the gap between active nematics and self-propulsive systems.",

With these features, the challenge of kind inference for datatype declarations has presented itself and become a worthy research problem on its own.   This paper studies kind inference for datatypes. Inspired by previous research on type-inference, we offer declarative specifications for what datatype declarations should be accepted, both for Haskell98 and for a more advanced system we call PolyKinds, based on the extensions in modern Haskell, including a limited form of dependent types. We believe these formulations to be novel and without precedent, even for Haskell98. These specifications are complemented with implementable algorithmic versions. We study soundness, completeness and the existence of principal kinds in these systems, proving the properties where they hold. This work can serve as a guide both to language designers who wish to formalize their datatype declarations and also to implementors keen to have principled inference of principal types.   This technical supplement to Kind Inference for Datatypes serves to expand upon the text in the main paper. It contains detailed typing rules, proofs, and connections to the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC).",

However, in real-world applications, users are often presented with a set of multiple images (e.g., 4-8) for each prompt, where independent sampling tends to lead to redundant results, limiting user choices and hindering idea exploration. In this work, we introduce a scalable group inference method that improves both the diversity and quality of a group of samples. We formulate group inference as a quadratic integer assignment problem: candidate outputs are modeled as graph nodes, and a subset is selected to optimize sample quality (unary term) while maximizing group diversity (binary term). To substantially improve runtime efficiency, we progressively prune the candidate set using intermediate predictions, allowing our method to scale up to large candidate sets. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly improves group diversity and quality compared to independent sampling baselines and recent inference algorithms. Our framework generalizes across a wide range of tasks, including text-to-image, image-to-image, image prompting, and video generation, enabling generative models to treat multiple outputs as cohesive groups rather than independent samples.",

      "abstract": "Active reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have recently been proposed to compensate for the severe multiplicative fading effect of conventional passive RIS-aided systems. Each reflecting element of active RISs is assisted by an amplifier such that the incident signal can be reflected and amplified instead of only being reflected as in passive RIS-aided systems. This work addresses the practical challenge that, on the one hand, in active RIS-aided systems the perfect individual CSI of the RIS-aided channels cannot be acquired due to the lack of signal processing power at the active RISs, but, on the other hand, this CSI is required to calculate the expected system data rate and RIS transmit power needed for transceiver design. To address this issue, we first derive closed-form expressions for the average achievable rate and the average RIS transmit power based on partial CSI of the RIS-aided channels. Then, we formulate an average achievable rate maximization problem for jointly optimizing the active beamforming at both the base station (BS) and the RIS. This problem is then tackled using the majorization--minimization (MM) algorithm framework, and, for each iteration, semi-closed-form solutions for the BS and RIS beamforming are derived based on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. To ensure the quality of service (QoS) of each user, we further formulate a rate outage constrained beamforming problem, which is solved using the Bernstein-Type inequality (BTI) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) techniques. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithms can efficiently overcome the challenges imposed by imperfect CSI in active RIS-aided wireless systems.",

      "abstract": "As a revolutionary paradigm for controlling wireless channels, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have emerged as a candidate technology for future 6G networks. However, due to the \"multiplicative fading\" effect, the existing passive RISs only achieve limited capacity gains in many scenarios with strong direct links. In this paper, the concept of active RISs is proposed to overcome this fundamental limitation. Unlike passive RISs that reflect signals without amplification, active RISs can amplify the reflected signals via amplifiers integrated into their elements. To characterize the signal amplification and incorporate the noise introduced by the active components, we develop and verify the signal model of active RISs through the experimental measurements based on a fabricated active RIS element. Based on the verified signal model, we further analyze the asymptotic performance of active RISs to reveal the substantial capacity gain they provide for wireless communications. Finally, we formulate the sum-rate maximization problem for an active RIS aided multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) system and a joint transmit beamforming and reflect precoding scheme is proposed to solve this problem. Simulation results show that, in a typical wireless system, passive RISs can realize only a limited sum-rate gain of 22%, while active RISs can achieve a significant sum-rate gain of 130%, thus overcoming the \"multiplicative fading\" effect.",

Here, we show that states of MIPS coexistence are in fact only metastable for three-dimensional active Brownian particles over a very broad range of conditions, decaying at long times through an ordering transition we call active crystallization. At an activity just above the MIPS critical point, the liquid-gas binodal is superseded by the crystal-fluid coexistence curve, with solid, liquid, and gas all coexisting at the triple point where the two curves intersect. Nucleating an active crystal from a disordered fluid, however, requires a rare fluctuation that exhibits the nearly close-packed density of the solid phase. The corresponding barrier to crystallization is surmountable on a feasible timescale only at high activity, and only at fluid densities near maximal packing. The glassiness expected for such dense liquids at equilibrium is strongly mitigated by active forces, so that the lifetime of liquid-gas coexistence declines steadily with increasing activity, manifesting in simulations as a facile spontaneous crystallization at extremely high activity.",

      "abstract": "This work combines the free energy principle from cognitive neuroscience and the ensuing active inference dynamics with recent advances in variational inference in deep generative models, and evolution strategies to introduce the \"deep active inference\" agent. This agent minimises a variational free energy bound on the average surprise of its sensations, which is motivated by a homeostatic argument. It does so by optimising the parameters of a generative latent variable model of its sensory inputs, together with a variational density approximating the posterior distribution over the latent variables, given its observations, and by acting on its environment to actively sample input that is likely under this generative model. The internal dynamics of the agent are implemented using deep and recurrent neural networks, as used in machine learning, making the deep active inference agent a scalable and very flexible class of active inference agent. Using the mountain car problem, we show how goal directed behaviour can be implemented by defining appropriate priors on the latent states in the agent's model. Furthermore, we show that the deep active inference agent can learn a generative model of the environment, which can be sampled from to understand the agent's beliefs about the environment and its interaction therewith.",

However, the traditional active learning process often demands extensive computational resources, hindering scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we address this critical issue by presenting a novel method designed to alleviate the computational burden associated with active learning on massive datasets. To achieve this goal, we introduce a simple, yet effective method-agnostic framework that outlines how to strategically choose and annotate data points, optimizing the process for efficiency while maintaining model performance.

In this paper, we show that any type of behaviour complying with physically sound assumptions about how macroscopic biological agents interact with the world canonically integrates exploration and exploitation in the sense of minimising risk and ambiguity about states of the world. This description, known as active inference, refines the free energy principle, a popular descriptive framework for action and perception originating in neuroscience. Active inference provides a normative Bayesian framework to simulate and model agency that is widely used in behavioural neuroscience, reinforcement learning (RL) and robotics. The usefulness of active inference for RL is three-fold. \\emph{a}) Active inference provides a principled solution to the exploration-exploitation dilemma that usefully simulates biological agency. \\emph{b}) It provides an explainable recipe to simulate behaviour, whence behaviour follows as an explainable mixture of exploration and exploitation under a generative world model, and all differences in behaviour are explicit in differences in world model. \\emph{c}) This framework is universal in the sense that it is theoretically possible to rewrite any RL algorithm conforming to the descriptive assumptions of active inference as an active inference algorithm. Thus, active inference can be used as a tool to uncover and compare the commitments and assumptions of more specific models of agency.",

      "abstract": "Active inference is a first principle account of how autonomous agents operate in dynamic, non-stationary environments. This problem is also considered in reinforcement learning (RL), but limited work exists on comparing the two approaches on the same discrete-state environments. In this paper, we provide: 1) an accessible overview of the discrete-state formulation of active inference, highlighting natural behaviors in active inference that are generally engineered in RL; 2) an explicit discrete-state comparison between active inference and RL on an OpenAI gym baseline. We begin by providing a condensed overview of the active inference literature, in particular viewing the various natural behaviors of active inference agents through the lens of RL. We show that by operating in a pure belief-based setting, active inference agents can carry out epistemic exploration, and account for uncertainty about their environment in a Bayes-optimal fashion. Furthermore, we show that the reliance on an explicit reward signal in RL is removed in active inference, where reward can simply be treated as another observation; even in the total absence of rewards, agent behaviors are learned through preference learning. We make these properties explicit by showing two scenarios in which active inference agents can infer behaviors in reward-free environments compared to both Q-learning and Bayesian model-based RL agents; by placing zero prior preferences over rewards and by learning the prior preferences over the observations corresponding to reward. We conclude by noting that this formalism can be applied to more complex settings if appropriate generative models can be formulated. In short, we aim to demystify the behavior of active inference agents by presenting an accessible discrete state-space and time formulation, and demonstrate these behaviors in a OpenAI gym environment, alongside RL agents.",

Assuming a budget on the number of labels that can be collected, the methodology uses a machine learning model to identify which data points would be most beneficial to label, thus effectively utilizing the budget. It operates on a simple yet powerful intuition: prioritize the collection of labels for data points where the model exhibits uncertainty, and rely on the model's predictions where it is confident. Active inference constructs provably valid confidence intervals and hypothesis tests while leveraging any black-box machine learning model and handling any data distribution. The key point is that it achieves the same level of accuracy with far fewer samples than existing baselines relying on non-adaptively-collected data. This means that for the same number of collected samples, active inference enables smaller confidence intervals and more powerful p-values.

However, decisions in medical domain are a resultant of attributes within medical diagnostic scans and electronic medical records (EMR).

We focus on reducing this insufficiency by designing a deployable clinical active learning (DECAL) framework within a bi-modal interface so as to add practicality to the paradigm. Our approach is a \"plug-in\" method that makes natural image based active learning algorithms generalize better and faster. We find that on two medical datasets on three architectures and five learning strategies, DECAL increases generalization across 20 rounds by approximately 4.81%. DECAL leads to a 5.59% and 7.02% increase in average accuracy as an initialization strategy for optical coherence tomography (OCT) and X-Ray respectively. Our active learning results were achieved using 3000 (5%) and 2000 (38%) samples of OCT and X-Ray data respectively.",

      "abstract": "Active inference is a unifying theory for perception and action resting upon the idea that the brain maintains an internal model of the world by minimizing free energy. From a behavioral perspective, active inference agents can be seen as self-evidencing beings that act to fulfill their optimistic predictions, namely preferred outcomes or goals. In contrast, reinforcement learning requires human-designed rewards to accomplish any desired outcome. Although active inference could provide a more natural self-supervised objective for control, its applicability has been limited because of the shortcomings in scaling the approach to complex environments. In this work, we propose a contrastive objective for active inference that strongly reduces the computational burden in learning the agent's generative model and planning future actions. Our method performs notably better than likelihood-based active inference in image-based tasks, while also being computationally cheaper and easier to train. We compare to reinforcement learning agents that have access to human-designed reward functions, showing that our approach closely matches their performance. Finally, we also show that contrastive methods perform significantly better in the case of distractors in the environment and that our method is able to generalize goals to variations in the background.

This result was reported recently to facilitate model-based supervised learning but it can be interpreted in a causality context as follows. One can compile a non-parametric causal graph into an arithmetic circuit that supports inference in time linear in the circuit size. The circuit is also non-parametric so it can be used to estimate parameters from data and to further reason (in linear time) about the causal graph parametrized by these estimates. Moreover, the circuit size can sometimes be bounded even when the treewidth of the causal graph is not, leading to tractable inference on models that have been deemed intractable previously. This has been enabled by a new technique that can exploit causal mechanisms computationally but without needing to know their identities (the classical setup in causal inference). Our goal is to provide a causality-oriented exposure to these new results and to speculate on how they may potentially contribute to more scalable and versatile causal inference.",

Our results hold for log-smooth posterior densities with and without strong log-concavity and the location-scale variational family. Also, our analysis reveals that certain algorithm design choices commonly employed in practice, particularly, nonlinear parameterizations of the scale of the variational approximation, can result in suboptimal convergence rates. Fortunately, running BBVI with proximal stochastic gradient descent fixes these limitations, and thus achieves the strongest known convergence rate guarantees. We evaluate this theoretical insight by comparing proximal SGD against other standard implementations of BBVI on large-scale Bayesian inference problems.",

We show that the active IRS should be deployed closer to the receiver with the IRS's decreasing amplification power; while in contrast, the passive IRS should be deployed near either the transmitter or receiver. Moreover, with optimized IRS placement, the passive IRS is shown to outperform its active counterpart when the number of reflecting elements is sufficiently large and/or the active-IRS amplification power is too small. Next, we optimize the IRS placement for both active and passive IRSs to maximize the weighted sum-rate of uplink and downlink communications. We show that in this case, the passive IRS is more likely to achieve superior rate performance. This is because the optimal active-IRS placement needs to balance the rate performance in the uplink and downlink, while deploying the passive IRS near the transmitter or receiver is optimal regardless of the uplink or downlink.",

Also, apart from algorithmic innovations, we account for more specific and powerful hardware (leading to higher FLOPS) that is usually accompanied with important energy efficiency optimisations. We also move the focus from the first implementation of a breakthrough paper towards the consolidated version of the techniques one or two year later. Under this distinctive and comprehensive perspective, we study relevant models in the areas of computer vision and natural language processing: for a sustained increase in performance we see a much softer growth in energy consumption than previously anticipated.

      "abstract": "Cardiac digital twins (CDTs) have the potential to offer individualized evaluation of cardiac function in a non-invasive manner, making them a promising approach for personalized diagnosis and treatment planning of my-ocardial infarction (MI). The inference of accurate myocardial tissue properties is crucial in creating a reliable CDT of MI. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of inferring myocardial tissue properties from the electrocardiogram (ECG) within a CDT platform. The platform integrates multi-modal data, such as cardiac MRI and ECG, to enhance the accuracy and reliability of the inferred tissue properties. We perform a sensitivity analysis based on computer simulations, systematically exploring the effects of infarct location, size, degree of transmurality, and electrical ac-tivity alteration on the simulated QRS complex of ECG, to establish the limits of the approach. We subsequently present a novel deep computational model, comprising a dual-branch variational autoencoder and an inference model, to infer infarct location and distribution from the simulated QRS. The proposed model achieves mean Dice scores of 0.457 \\pm 0.317 and 0.302 \\pm 0.273 for the inference of left ventricle scars and border zone, respectively. The sensitivity analysis enhances our understanding of the complex relationship between infarct characteristics and electrophysiological features. The in silico experimental results show that the model can effectively capture the relationship for the inverse inference, with promising potential for clinical application in the future. The code will be released publicly once the manuscript is accepted for publication.",

      "abstract": "Active particle systems of interacting self-propelled particles offer a versatile framework for modeling complex systems. When employed to describe aspects of animal behavior, the complexity of animal movement and decision-making often requires the use of unique types of effective interactions between the particles -- notably nonreciprocal effective forces that do not obey the usual conservation laws of Newtonian mechanics. Here we review two recent empirically-motivated models, of two very different types of animal behavior, where the behavior is described in terms of active particles which interact through nonreciprocal effective forces. The first model describes the dynamics of animal contests, wherein typically two rivals fight over a localized resource. The uniquely shaped effective potentials between the model's 'contestant particles' manifest the adversarial nature of contest interactions and capture the dynamical essence of contest behavior in space and time. The second model describes the stabilization of cohesive swarms through long-range and adaptive gravity-like attraction. This 'adaptive gravity' model explains the observed mass and velocity profiles of laboratory midge swarms. These examples demonstrate that theoretical models that use the framework of active particles to describe animal behavior can expand the scope of active-particle research, as well as explain complex phenomena in animal behavior.",

      "abstract": "In multiple instance multiple label learning, each sample, a bag, consists of multiple instances. To alleviate labeling complexity, each sample is associated with a set of bag-level labels leaving instances within the bag unlabeled. This setting is more convenient and natural for representing complicated objects, which have multiple semantic meanings. Compared to single instance labeling, this approach allows for labeling larger datasets at an equivalent labeling cost. However, for sufficiently large datasets, labeling all bags may become prohibitively costly. Active learning uses an iterative labeling and retraining approach aiming to provide reasonable classification performance using a small number of labeled samples. To our knowledge, only a few works in the area of active learning in the MIML setting are available. These approaches can provide practical solutions to reduce labeling cost but their efficacy remains unclear. In this paper, we propose a novel bag-class pair based approach for active learning in the MIML setting. Due to the partial availability of bag-level labels, we focus on the incomplete-label MIML setting for the proposed active learning approach. Our approach is based on a discriminative graphical model with efficient and exact inference. For the query process, we adapt active learning criteria to the novel bag-class pair selection strategy. Additionally, we introduce an online stochastic gradient descent algorithm to provide an efficient model update after each query. Numerical experiments on benchmark datasets illustrate the robustness of the proposed approach.",

      "abstract": "The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven the need for increasingly sophisticated inference pipelines and hardware platforms. Modern LLM serving extends beyond traditional prefill-decode workflows, incorporating multi-stage processes such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), key-value (KV) cache retrieval, dynamic model routing, and multi step reasoning. These stages exhibit diverse computational demands, requiring distributed systems that integrate GPUs, ASICs, CPUs, and memory-centric architectures. However, existing simulators lack the fidelity to model these heterogeneous, multi-engine workflows, limiting their ability to inform architectural decisions.   To address this gap, we introduce HERMES, a Heterogeneous Multi-stage LLM inference Execution Simulator. HERMES models diverse request stages; including RAG, KV retrieval, reasoning, prefill, and decode across complex hardware hierarchies. HERMES supports heterogeneous clients executing multiple models concurrently unlike prior frameworks while incorporating advanced batching strategies and multi-level memory hierarchies. By integrating real hardware traces with analytical modeling, HERMES captures critical trade-offs such as memory bandwidth contention, inter-cluster communication latency, and batching efficiency in hybrid CPU-accelerator deployments. Through case studies, we explore the impact of reasoning stages on end-to-end latency, optimal batching strategies for hybrid pipelines, and the architectural implications of remote KV cache retrieval. HERMES empowers system designers to navigate the evolving landscape of LLM inference, providing actionable insights into optimizing hardware-software co-design for next-generation AI workloads.",

Causal inference is widely studied and used to estimate the downstream impact of individual's interactions with products and features.

In this context, well-established algorithms for efficiently computing the set of pairs of interacting particles have established excellent open-source packages to efficiently simulate large systems over long time scales -- a crucial consideration given the separation in time- and length-scales often observed in soft matter. What happens, though, when we think more broadly about what it means to construct a neighbor list? What if interactions are non-reciprocal, or if the \"range\" of an interaction is determined not by a distance scale but according to some other consideration? As the field of soft and active matter increasingly considers the properties of living matter -- from the cellular to the super-organismal scale -- these questions become increasingly relevant, and encourage us to think about new physical and computational paradigms in the modeling of active matter.

Model-based RL suggests that this is best achieved by learning and exploiting a probabilistic model of the world. 'Active inference' is an emerging normative framework in cognitive and computational neuroscience that offers a unifying account of how biological agents achieve this. On this framework, inference, learning and action emerge from a single imperative to maximize the Bayesian evidence for a niched model of the world. However, implementations of this process have thus far been restricted to low-dimensional and idealized situations. Here, we present a working implementation of active inference that applies to high-dimensional tasks, with proof-of-principle results demonstrating efficient exploration and an order of magnitude increase in sample efficiency over strong model-free baselines. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of applying active inference at scale and highlight the operational homologies between active inference and current model-based approaches to RL.",

Likewise, if you are not using your sonar at all. In between those two extremes there is an optimum. We will find that optimum. Or said more precisely and general: In the same two dimensional region two platforms are present. One platform, the searcher, equipped with one active sensor (sonar, radar, lidar etc.), is trying to detect the other platform, the target, by means of its active sensor. The target tries to avoid detection using only a passive sensor to detect the searcher. The target can detect the active sensor before the searcher can detect the target (forestalling). The active sensor is therefore used intermittently to surprise the target. The aim of this study is to quantify the passive period of the active sensor by minimizing missed detection opportunities. The active period is subsequently found by maximizing the average detection width of the searcher sensor over time.",

However, conventional digital twins rely primarily on passive data assimilation, which limits their adaptability in uncertain and dynamic environments. This paper introduces the active digital twin paradigm, based on active inference. Active inference is a neuroscience-inspired, Bayesian framework for probabilistic reasoning and predictive modeling that unifies inference, decision-making, and learning under a unique, free energy minimization objective. By formulating the evolution of the active digital twin as a partially observable Markov decision process, the active inference agent continuously refines its generative model through Bayesian updates and forecasts future states and observations. Decision-making emerges from an optimization process that balances pragmatic exploitation (maximizing goal-directed utility) and epistemic exploration or information gain (actively resolving uncertainty). Actions are dynamically planned to minimize expected free energy, which quantifies both the divergence between predicted and preferred future observations, and the epistemic value of expected information gain about hidden states. This approach enables a new level of autonomy and resilience in digital twins, offering superior spontaneous exploration capabilities. The proposed framework is assessed on the health monitoring and predictive maintenance of a railway bridge.",

In recent years, this framework has successfully been applied to a variety of situations where the goal was to maximise reward, offering comparable and sometimes superior performance to alternative approaches. In this paper, we clarify the connection between reward maximisation and active inference by demonstrating how and when active inference agents perform actions that are optimal for maximising reward. Precisely, we show the conditions under which active inference produces the optimal solution to the Bellman equation--a formulation that underlies several approaches to model-based reinforcement learning and control. On partially observed Markov decision processes, the standard active inference scheme can produce Bellman optimal actions for planning horizons of 1, but not beyond. In contrast, a recently developed recursive active inference scheme (sophisticated inference) can produce Bellman optimal actions on any finite temporal horizon. We append the analysis with a discussion of the broader relationship between active inference and reinforcement learning.",

      "abstract": "We develop a generalized active contour formalism for image segmentation based on shape templates. The shape template is subjected to a restricted affine transformation (RAT) in order to segment the object of interest. RAT allows for translation, rotation, and scaling, which give a total of five degrees of freedom. The proposed active contour comprises an inner and outer contour pair, which are closed and concentric. The active contour energy is a contrast function defined based on the intensities of pixels that lie inside the inner contour and those that lie in the annulus between the inner and outer contours. We show that the contrast energy functional is optimal under certain conditions. The optimal RAT parameters are computed by maximizing the contrast function using a gradient descent optimizer. We show that the calculations are made efficient through use of Green's theorem. The proposed formalism is capable of handling a variety of shapes because for a chosen template, optimization is carried with respect to the RAT parameters only. The proposed formalism is validated on multiple images to show robustness to Gaussian and Poisson noise, to initialization, and to partial loss of structure in the object to be segmented.",

      "abstract": "Active learning aims to obtain a classifier of high accuracy by using fewer label requests in comparison to passive learning by selecting effective queries. Many active learning methods have been developed in the past two decades, which sample queries based on informativeness or representativeness of unlabeled data points. In this work, we explore a novel querying criterion based on statistical leverage scores. The statistical leverage scores of a row in a matrix are the squared row-norms of the matrix containing its (top) left singular vectors and is a measure of influence of the row on the matrix. Leverage scores have been used for detecting high influential points in regression diagnostics and have been recently shown to be useful for data analysis and randomized low-rank matrix approximation algorithms. We explore how sampling data instances with high statistical leverage scores perform in active learning. Our empirical comparison on several binary classification datasets indicate that querying high leverage points is an effective strategy.",

An alternative, but less explored, model-free RL algorithm is the successor representation, which expresses the value function in terms of a successor matrix of expected future state occupancies. In this paper, we derive the probabilistic interpretation of the successor representation in terms of Bayesian filtering and thus design a novel active inference agent architecture utilizing successor representations instead of model-based planning. We demonstrate that active inference successor representations have significant advantages over current active inference agents in terms of planning horizon and computational cost.

      "abstract": "Existing safety assurance research has primarily focused on training-phase alignment to instill safe behaviors into LLMs. However, recent studies have exposed these methods' susceptibility to diverse jailbreak attacks. Concurrently, inference scaling has significantly advanced LLM reasoning capabilities but remains unexplored in the context of safety assurance. Addressing this gap, our work pioneers inference scaling for robust and effective LLM safety against emerging threats. We reveal that conventional inference scaling techniques, despite their success in reasoning tasks, perform poorly in safety contexts, even falling short of basic approaches like Best-of-N Sampling. We attribute this inefficiency to a newly identified challenge, the exploration--efficiency dilemma, arising from the high computational overhead associated with frequent process reward model (PRM) evaluations. To overcome this dilemma, we propose SAFFRON, a novel inference scaling paradigm tailored explicitly for safety assurance. Central to our approach is the introduction of a multifurcation reward model (MRM) that significantly reduces the required number of reward model evaluations. To operationalize this paradigm, we further propose: (i) a partial supervision training objective for MRM, (ii) a conservative exploration constraint to prevent out-of-distribution explorations, and (iii) a Trie-based key--value caching strategy that facilitates cache sharing across sequences during tree search. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method. Additionally, we publicly release our trained multifurcation reward model (Saffron-1) and the accompanying token-level safety reward dataset (Safety4M) to accelerate future research in LLM safety.

We propose Active Domain Randomization, a novel algorithm that learns a parameter sampling strategy. Our method looks for the most informative environment variations within the given randomization ranges by leveraging the discrepancies of policy rollouts in randomized and reference environment instances. We find that training more frequently on these instances leads to better overall agent generalization.

However, perhaps because of inadequate tools for matrix exponentiation in programming languages commonly used amongst statisticians or a belief that the necessary calculations are prohibitively expensive, statistical inference for continuous-time Markov chains with a large but finite state space is typically conducted via particle MCMC or other relatively complex inference schemes.   When, as in many applications $\\mathsf{Q}$ arises from a reaction network, it is usually sparse. We describe variations on known algorithms which allow fast, robust and accurate evaluation of the product of a non-negative vector with the exponential of a large, sparse rate matrix. Our implementation uses relatively recently developed, efficient, linear algebra tools that take advantage of such sparsity. We demonstrate the straightforward statistical application of the key algorithm on a model for the mixing of two alleles in a population and on the Susceptible-Infectious-Removed epidemic model.",

Active inference has seen growing applications in academic research, especially in fields that seek to model human or animal behavior. While in recent years, some of the code arising from the active inference literature has been written in open source languages like Python and Julia, to-date, the most popular software for simulating active inference agents is the DEM toolbox of SPM, a MATLAB library originally developed for the statistical analysis and modelling of neuroimaging data. Increasing interest in active inference, manifested both in terms of sheer number as well as diversifying applications across scientific disciplines, has thus created a need for generic, widely-available, and user-friendly code for simulating active inference in open-source scientific computing languages like Python. The Python package we present here, pymdp (see https://github.com/infer-actively/pymdp), represents a significant step in this direction: namely, we provide the first open-source package for simulating active inference with partially-observable Markov Decision Processes or POMDPs. We review the package's structure and explain its advantages like modular design and customizability, while providing in-text code blocks along the way to demonstrate how it can be used to build and run active inference processes with ease. We developed pymdp to increase the accessibility and exposure of the active inference framework to researchers, engineers, and developers with diverse disciplinary backgrounds. In the spirit of open-source software, we also hope that it spurs new innovation, development, and collaboration in the growing active inference community.",

      "abstract": "The convergence of edge computing and AI gives rise to Edge-AI, which enables the deployment of real-time AI applications and services at the network edge. One of the fundamental research issues in Edge-AI is edge inference acceleration, which aims to realize low-latency high-accuracy DNN inference services by leveraging the fine-grained offloading of partitioned inference tasks from end devices to edge servers. However, existing research has yet to adopt a practical Edge-AI market perspective, which would systematically explore the personalized inference needs of AI users (e.g., inference accuracy, latency, and task complexity), the revenue incentives for AI service providers that offer edge inference services, and multi-stakeholder governance within a market-oriented context. To bridge this gap, we propose an Auction-based Edge Inference Pricing Mechanism (AERIA) for revenue maximization to tackle the multi-dimensional optimization problem of DNN model partition, edge inference pricing, and resource allocation. We investigate the multi-exit device-edge synergistic inference scheme for on-demand DNN inference acceleration, and analyse the auction dynamics amongst the AI service providers, AI users and edge infrastructure provider. Owing to the strategic mechanism design via randomized consensus estimate and cost sharing techniques, the Edge-AI market attains several desirable properties, including competitiveness in revenue maximization, incentive compatibility, and envy-freeness, which are crucial to maintain the effectiveness, truthfulness, and fairness of our auction outcomes. The extensive simulation experiments based on four representative DNN inference workloads demonstrate that our AERIA mechanism significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches in revenue maximization, demonstrating the efficacy of AERIA for on-demand DNN inference in the Edge-AI market.",

We formalize this issue by deriving a necessary and sufficient condition for its validity, and show that this condition is frequently violated in practice: specifications from 77% of empirical research articles in American Economic Review and Econometrica during 2020-2021 appear not to meet it. To address this limitation, we propose a genuinely robust inference procedure based on a new cluster score bootstrap. We establish its validity and size control across broad classes of data-generating processes where conventional methods break down. Simulation studies corroborate our theoretical findings, and empirical applications illustrate that employing the proposed method can substantially alter conventional statistical conclusions.",

      "abstract": "Active search is the process of identifying high-value data points in a large and often high-dimensional parameter space that can be expensive to evaluate. Traditional active search techniques like Bayesian optimization trade off exploration and exploitation over consecutive evaluations, and have historically focused on single or small (<5) numbers of examples evaluated per round. As modern data sets grow, so does the need to scale active search to large data sets and batch sizes. In this paper, we present a general hierarchical framework based on bandit algorithms to scale active search to large batch sizes by maximizing information derived from the unique structure of each dataset. Our hierarchical framework, Hierarchical Batch Bandit Search (HBBS), strategically distributes batch selection across a learned embedding space by facilitating wide exploration of different structural elements within a dataset. We focus our application of HBBS on modern biology, where large batch experimentation is often fundamental to the research process, and demonstrate batch design of biological sequences (protein and DNA). We also present a new Gym environment to easily simulate diverse biological sequences and to enable more comprehensive evaluation of active search methods across heterogeneous data sets. The HBBS framework improves upon standard performance, wall-clock, and scalability benchmarks for batch search by using a broad exploration strategy across coarse partitions and fine-grained exploitation within each partition of structured data.",

At its core, active inference is based on the principle that the brain is an approximate Bayesian inference engine, building an internal generative model to drive agents towards minimal surprise.

In this paper, we leverage recent advances in deep learning to build more complex generative models that can work without a predefined states space. State representations are learned end-to-end from real-world, high-dimensional sensory data such as camera frames. We also show that these generative models can be used to engage in active inference.

In normal active inference, the Markov Blanket is defined starting from the agent. That is, first the agent was defined as the entity that performs the \"action\" such as a robot or a person, then the environment was defined as other people or objects that are directly affected by the agent's \"action,\" and the boundary between the agent and the environment was defined as the Markov Blanket. This agent-centric definition does not allow the agent to respond to unintended changes in the environment caused by factors outside of the defined environment. In the proposed EC-AIF, there is no entity corresponding to an agent. The environment includes all observable things, including people and things conventionally considered to be the environment, as well as entities that perform \"actions\" such as robots and people. Accordingly, all states, including robots and people, are included in inference targets, eliminating unintended changes in the environment. The EC-AIF was applied to a robot arm and validated with an object transport task by the robot arm. The results showed that the robot arm successfully transported objects while responding to changes in the target position of the object and to changes in the orientation of another robot arm.",

      "abstract": "The deployment of Deep Learning (DL) models is still precluded in those contexts where the amount of supervised data is limited. To answer this issue, active learning strategies aim at minimizing the amount of labelled data required to train a DL model. Most active strategies are based on uncertain sample selection, and even often restricted to samples lying close to the decision boundary. These techniques are theoretically sound, but an understanding of the selected samples based on their content is not straightforward, further driving non-experts to consider DL as a black-box. For the first time, here we propose to take into consideration common domain-knowledge and enable non-expert users to train a model with fewer samples. In our Knowledge-driven Active Learning (KAL) framework, rule-based knowledge is converted into logic constraints and their violation is checked as a natural guide for sample selection. We show that even simple relationships among data and output classes offer a way to spot predictions for which the model need supervision. We empirically show that KAL (i) outperforms many active learning strategies, particularly in those contexts where domain knowledge is rich, (ii) it discovers data distribution lying far from the initial training data, (iii) it ensures domain experts that the provided knowledge is acquired by the model, (iv) it is suitable for regression and object recognition tasks unlike uncertainty-based strategies, and (v) its computational demand is low.",

Given a budget on the number of labeled data points that can be collected and assuming access to an AI predictive model, the basic idea is to improve estimation accuracy by prioritizing the collection of labels where the model is most uncertain. The drawback, however, is that inaccurate uncertainty estimates can make active sampling produce highly noisy results, potentially worse than those from naive uniform sampling. In this work, we present robust sampling strategies for active statistical inference. Robust sampling ensures that the resulting estimator is never worse than the estimator using uniform sampling. Furthermore, with reliable uncertainty estimates, the estimator usually outperforms standard active inference. This is achieved by optimally interpolating between uniform and active sampling, depending on the quality of the uncertainty scores, and by using ideas from robust optimization. We demonstrate the utility of the method on a series of real datasets from computational social science and survey research.",

We cast generative models formally as systems \"on an interface\", with the latter being a compositional abstraction of the usual notion of Markov blanket; agents are then 'controllers' for their generative models, formally dual to them. This opens the active inference landscape to new horizons, such as: agents with structured interfaces (e.g. with 'mode-dependence', or that interact with computer APIs); agents that can manage other agents; and 'meta-agents', that use active inference to change their (internal or external) structure. With structured interfaces, we also gain structured ('typed') policies, which are amenable to formal verification, an important step towards safe artificial agents. Moreover, we can make use of categorical logic to describe express agents' goals as formal predicates, whose satisfaction may be dependent on the interaction context. This points towards powerful compositional tools to constrain and control self-organizing ensembles of agents.",

Each player can communicate $\\ell$ bits to a central referee in a simultaneous message passing model of communication to help the referee infer a property of the unknown $\\bf p$. What is the least number of players for inference required in the communication-starved setting of $\\ell<\\log k$? We begin by exploring a general \"simulate-and-infer\" strategy for such inference problems where the center simulates the desired number of samples from the unknown distribution and applies standard inference algorithms for the collocated setting. Our first result shows that for $\\ell<\\log k$ perfect simulation of even a single sample is not possible. Nonetheless, we present a Las Vegas algorithm that simulates a single sample from the unknown distribution using $O(k/2^\\ell)$ samples in expectation. As an immediate corollary, we get that simulate-and-infer attains the optimal sample complexity of $Θ(k^2/2^\\ellε^2)$ for learning the unknown distribution to total variation distance $ε$. For the prototypical testing problem of identity testing, simulate-and-infer works with $O(k^{3/2}/2^\\ellε^2)$ samples, a requirement that seems to be inherent for all communication protocols not using any additional resources. Interestingly, we can break this barrier using public coins. Specifically, we exhibit a public-coin communication protocol that performs identity testing using $O(k/\\sqrt{2^\\ell}ε^2)$ samples. Furthermore, we show that this is optimal up to constant factors. Our theoretically sample-optimal protocol is easy to implement in practice. Our proof of lower bound entails showing a contraction in $χ^2$ distance of product distributions due to communication constraints and may be of independent interest.",

A recent paradigm, active inference, brings fundamental insights into the adaptation of biological organisms, constantly striving to minimize prediction errors to restrict themselves to life-compatible states. Over the past years, many studies have shown how human and animal behaviors could be explained in terms of active inference - either as discrete decision-making or continuous motor control - inspiring innovative solutions in robotics and artificial intelligence. Still, the literature lacks a comprehensive outlook on effectively planning realistic actions in changing environments. Setting ourselves the goal of modeling complex tasks such as tool use, we delve into the topic of dynamic planning in active inference, keeping in mind two crucial aspects of biological behavior: the capacity to understand and exploit affordances for object manipulation, and to learn the hierarchical interactions between the self and the environment, including other agents. We start from a simple unit and gradually describe more advanced structures, comparing recently proposed design choices and providing basic examples. This study distances itself from traditional views centered on neural networks and reinforcement learning, and points toward a yet unexplored direction in active inference: hybrid representations in hierarchical models.",

The main idea in this talk is to show how the Bayesian inference can naturally give us all the necessary tools we need to solve real inverse problems: starting by simple inversion where we assume to know exactly the forward model and all the input model parameters up to more realistic advanced problems of myopic or blind inversion where we may be uncertain about the forward model and we may have noisy data. Starting by an introduction to inverse problems through a few examples and explaining their ill posedness nature, I briefly presented the main classical deterministic methods such as data matching and classical regularization methods to show their limitations. I then presented the main classical probabilistic methods based on likelihood, information theory and maximum entropy and the Bayesian inference framework for such problems. I show that the Bayesian framework, not only generalizes all these methods, but also gives us natural tools, for example, for inferring the uncertainty of the computed solutions, for the estimation of the hyperparameters or for handling myopic or blind inversion problems. Finally, through a deconvolution problem example, I presented a few state of the art methods based on Bayesian inference particularly designed for some of the mass spectrometry data processing problems.",

      "abstract": "A key feature of sequential decision making under uncertainty is a need to balance between exploiting--choosing the best action according to the current knowledge, and exploring--obtaining information about values of other actions. The multi-armed bandit problem, a classical task that captures this trade-off, served as a vehicle in machine learning for developing bandit algorithms that proved to be useful in numerous industrial applications. The active inference framework, an approach to sequential decision making recently developed in neuroscience for understanding human and animal behaviour, is distinguished by its sophisticated strategy for resolving the exploration-exploitation trade-off. This makes active inference an exciting alternative to already established bandit algorithms. Here we derive an efficient and scalable approximate active inference algorithm and compare it to two state-of-the-art bandit algorithms: Bayesian upper confidence bound and optimistic Thompson sampling. This comparison is done on two types of bandit problems: a stationary and a dynamic switching bandit. Our empirical evaluation shows that the active inference algorithm does not produce efficient long-term behaviour in stationary bandits. However, in the more challenging switching bandit problem active inference performs substantially better than the two state-of-the-art bandit algorithms. The results open exciting venues for further research in theoretical and applied machine learning, as well as lend additional credibility to active inference as a general framework for studying human and animal behaviour.",

However, despite its theoretical utility, computational implementations have largely been restricted to low-dimensional, deterministic settings. This paper highlights that this is a consequence of the inability to adequately model stochastic transition dynamics, particularly when an extensive policy (i.e., action trajectory) space must be evaluated during planning. Fortunately, recent advancements propose a modified planning algorithm for finite temporal horizons. We build upon this work to assess the utility of active inference for a stochastic control setting. For this, we simulate the classic windy grid-world task with additional complexities, namely: 1) environment stochasticity; 2) learning of transition dynamics; and 3) partial observability. Our results demonstrate the advantage of using active inference, compared to reinforcement learning, in both deterministic and stochastic settings.",

In this paper, we claim that active inference can be interpreted using reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms and find a theoretical connection between them. We extend the concept of expected free energy (EFE), which is a core quantity in active inference, and claim that EFE can be treated as a negative value function. Motivated by the concept of prior preference and a theoretical connection, we propose a simple but novel method for learning a prior preference from experts. This illustrates that the problem with inverse RL can be approached with a new perspective of active inference. Experimental results of prior preference learning show the possibility of active inference with EFE-based rewards and its application to an inverse RL problem.",

      "abstract": "Robotic manipulation stands as a largely unsolved problem despite significant advances in robotics and machine learning in the last decades. One of the central challenges of manipulation is partial observability, as the agent usually does not know all physical properties of the environment and the objects it is manipulating in advance. A recently emerging theory that deals with partial observability in an explicit manner is Active Inference. It does so by driving the agent to act in a way that is not only goal-directed but also informative about the environment. In this work, we apply Active Inference to a hard-to-explore simulated robotic manipulation tasks, in which the agent has to balance a ball into a target zone. Since the reward of this task is sparse, in order to explore this environment, the agent has to learn to balance the ball without any extrinsic feedback, purely driven by its own curiosity. We show that the information-seeking behavior induced by Active Inference allows the agent to explore these challenging, sparse environments systematically. Finally, we conclude that using an information-seeking objective is beneficial in sparse environments and allows the agent to solve tasks in which methods that do not exhibit directed exploration fail.",

In this chapter, we describe how active inference combines Bayesian decision theory and optimal Bayesian design principles under a single imperative to minimize expected free energy. It is this aspect of active inference that allows for the natural emergence of information-seeking behavior. When removing prior outcomes preferences from expected free energy, active inference reduces to optimal Bayesian design, i.e., information gain maximization. Conversely, active inference reduces to Bayesian decision theory in the absence of ambiguity and relative risk, i.e., expected utility maximization. Using these limiting cases, we illustrate how behaviors differ when agents select actions that optimize expected utility, expected information gain, and expected free energy. Our T-maze simulations show optimizing expected free energy produces goal-directed information-seeking behavior while optimizing expected utility induces purely exploitive behavior and maximizing information gain engenders intrinsically motivated behavior.",

      "abstract": "Contextualized or discourse aware commonsense inference is the task of generating coherent commonsense assertions (i.e., facts) from a given story, and a particular sentence from that story. Some problems with the task are: lack of controllability for topics of the inferred facts; lack of commonsense knowledge during training; and, possibly, hallucinated or false facts. In this work, we utilize a transformer model for this task and develop techniques to address the aforementioned problems in the task. We control the inference by introducing a new technique we call \"hinting\". Hinting is a kind of language model prompting, that utilizes both hard prompts (specific words) and soft prompts (virtual learnable templates). This serves as a control signal to advise the language model \"what to talk about\". Next, we establish a methodology for performing joint inference with multiple commonsense knowledge bases. Joint inference of commonsense requires care, because it is imprecise and the level of generality is more flexible. You want to be sure that the results \"still make sense\" for the context. To this end, we align the textual version of assertions from three knowledge graphs (ConceptNet, ATOMIC2020, and GLUCOSE) with a story and a target sentence. This combination allows us to train a single model to perform joint inference with multiple knowledge graphs. We show experimental results for the three knowledge graphs on joint inference. Our final contribution is exploring a GAN architecture that generates the contextualized commonsense assertions and scores them as to their plausibility through a discriminator. The result is an integrated system for contextual commonsense inference in stories, that can controllably generate plausible commonsense assertions, and takes advantage of joint inference between multiple commonsense knowledge bases.",

A brief qualitative description of these algorithms namely meta-cognitive fuzzy inference system (McFIS), sequential adaptive fuzzy inference system (SAFIS) and evolving Takagi-Sugeno (ETS) model provide a comprehensive comparison of their working principle, especially their unique characteristics are discussed. These algorithms are then simulated with dataset collected at one of the academic buildings at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. The performance are compared by means of the root mean squared error (RMSE) and non-destructive error index (NDEI) of the predicted output.

However, a major obstacle to the widespread use of variational methods is the lack of post-hoc accuracy measures that are both theoretically justified and computationally efficient. In this paper, we provide rigorous bounds on the error of posterior mean and uncertainty estimates that arise from full-distribution approximations, as in variational inference. Our bounds are widely applicable, as they require only that the approximating and exact posteriors have polynomial moments. Our bounds are also computationally efficient for variational inference because they require only standard values from variational objectives, straightforward analytic calculations, and simple Monte Carlo estimates. We show that our analysis naturally leads to a new and improved workflow for validated variational inference. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our proposed workflow and error bounds on a robust regression problem and on a real-data example with a widely used multilevel hierarchical model.",

      "abstract": "Active inference is a normative principle underwriting perception, action, planning, decision-making and learning in biological or artificial agents. From its inception, its associated process theory has grown to incorporate complex generative models, enabling simulation of a wide range of complex behaviours. Due to successive developments in active inference, it is often difficult to see how its underlying principle relates to process theories and practical implementation. In this paper, we try to bridge this gap by providing a complete mathematical synthesis of active inference on discrete state-space models. This technical summary provides an overview of the theory, derives neuronal dynamics from first principles and relates this dynamics to biological processes. Furthermore, this paper provides a fundamental building block needed to understand active inference for mixed generative models; allowing continuous sensations to inform discrete representations. This paper may be used as follows: to guide research towards outstanding challenges, a practical guide on how to implement active inference to simulate experimental behaviour, or a pointer towards various in-silico neurophysiological responses that may be used to make empirical predictions.",

Recently, it has been demonstrated as a promising approach for constructing goal-driven behavior in robotics. Specifically, the active inference controller (AIC) has been successful on several continuous control and state-estimation tasks. Despite its relative success, some established design choices lead to a number of practical limitations for robot control. These include having a biased estimate of the state, and only an implicit model of control actions. In this paper, we highlight these limitations and propose an extended version of the unbiased active inference controller (u-AIC). The u-AIC maintains all the compelling benefits of the AIC and removes its limitations. Simulation results on a 2-DOF arm and experiments on a real 7-DOF manipulator show the improved performance of the u-AIC with respect to the standard AIC.

Although this possibility has been ruled out, there are strong evidences that solar variability has an influence on Earth's climate, in regional scales.   Here we review some of these evidences, focusing in a particular aspect of climate: atmospheric moisture and related quantities like precipitation. In particular, we studied the influence of activity on South American precipitations during centuries. First, we analyzed the stream flow of the Paraná and other rivers of the region, and found a very strong correlation with Sunspot Number in decadal time scales. We found a similar correlation between Sunspot Number and tree-ring chronologies, which allows us to extend our study to cover the last two centuries.",

When training for a given variable scene, i.e., changing objects, materials, lights and viewpoint, the space D of possible training data instances quickly becomes unmanageable as the dimensions of variable parameters increase. We introduce a novel Active Exploration method using Markov Chain Monte Carlo, which explores D, generating samples (i.e., ground truth renderings) that best help training and interleaves training and on-the-fly sample data generation. We introduce a self-tuning sample reuse strategy to minimize the expensive step of rendering training samples. We apply our approach on a neural generator that learns to render novel scene instances given an explicit parameterization of the scene configuration. Our results show that Active Exploration trains our network much more efficiently than uniformly sampling, and together with our resolution enhancement approach, achieves better quality than uniform sampling at convergence. Our method allows interactive rendering of hard light transport paths (e.g., complex caustics) -- that require very high samples counts to be captured -- and provides dynamic scene navigation and manipulation, after training for 5-18 hours depending on required quality and variations.",

Here, we take a different approach: starting with active inference, a first principles framework for modelling behaviour as (approximate) Bayesian inference, and building up to a minimal theory of consciousness, which emerges from the shared features of computational models derived under active inference.

Our inspiration for this paper is to marry these two approaches and reap the benefits of both. In order to do so we will introduce a novel approximate inference scheme inspired by the GP-LVM and the VAE. We show experimentally that the approximation allows the capacity of the generative bottle-neck (Z) of the VAE to be arbitrarily large without losing a highly interpretable representation, allowing reconstruction quality to be unlimited by Z at the same time as a low-dimensional space can be used to perform ancestral sampling from as well as a means to reason about the embedded data.",

It works by projecting virtual patterns consistent with the scene geometry onto the left and right images acquired by a conventional stereo camera, using the sparse hints obtained from a depth sensor, to facilitate the visual correspondence. Purposely, any depth sensing device can be seamlessly plugged into our framework, enabling the deployment of a virtual active stereo setup in any possible environment and overcoming the severe limitations of physical pattern projection, such as the limited working range and environmental conditions. Exhaustive experiments on indoor and outdoor datasets featuring both long and close range, including those providing raw, unfiltered depth hints from off-the-shelf depth sensors, highlight the effectiveness of our approach in notably boosting the robustness and accuracy of algorithms and deep stereo without any code modification and even without re-training. Additionally, we assess the performance of our strategy on active stereo evaluation datasets with conventional pattern projection. Indeed, in all these scenarios, our virtual pattern projection paradigm achieves state-of-the-art performance. The source code is available at: https://github.com/bartn8/vppstereo.",

      "abstract": "Active inference is emerging as a possible unifying theory of perception and action in cognitive and computational neuroscience. On this theory, perception is a process of inferring the causes of sensory data by minimising the error between actual sensations and those predicted by an inner \\emph{generative} (probabilistic) model. Action on the other hand is drawn as a process that modifies the world such that the consequent sensory input meets expectations encoded in the same internal model. These two processes, inferring properties of the world and inferring actions needed to meet expectations, close the sensory/motor loop and suggest a deep symmetry between action and perception. In this work we present a simple agent-based model inspired by this new theory that offers insights on some of its central ideas. Previous implementations of active inference have typically examined a \"perception-oriented\" view of this theory, assuming that agents are endowed with a detailed generative model of their surrounding environment. In contrast, we present an \"action-oriented\" solution showing how adaptive behaviour can emerge even when agents operate with a simple model which bears little resemblance to their environment. We examine how various parameters of this formulation allow phototaxis and present an example of a different, \"pathological\" behaviour.",

      "abstract": "The way the brain selects and controls actions is still widely debated. Mainstream approaches based on Optimal Control focus on stimulus-response mappings that optimize cost functions. Ideomotor theory and cybernetics propose a different perspective: they suggest that actions are selected and controlled by activating action effects and by continuously matching internal predictions with sensations. Active Inference offers a modern formulation of these ideas, in terms of inferential mechanisms and prediction-error-based control, which can be linked to neural mechanisms of living organisms. This article provides a technical illustration of Active Inference models in continuous time and a brief survey of Active Inference models that solve four kinds of control problems; namely, the control of goal-directed reaching movements, active sensing, the resolution of multisensory conflict during movement and the integration of decision-making and motor control. Crucially, in Active Inference, all these different facets of motor control emerge from the same optimization process - namely, the minimization of Free Energy - and do not require designing separate cost functions. Therefore, Active Inference provides a unitary perspective on various aspects of motor control that can inform both the study of biological control mechanisms and the design of artificial and robotic systems.",

For semantic segmentation, state-of-the-art models jointly use two criteria of uncertainty and diversity to select training labels, combined with a pixel-wise acquisition strategy. However, we show that such methods currently suffer from a class imbalance issue which degrades their performance for larger active learning budgets. We then introduce Class Balanced Dynamic Acquisition (CBDA), a novel active learning method that mitigates this issue, especially in high-budget regimes. The more balanced labels increase minority class performance, which in turn allows the model to outperform the previous baseline by 0.6, 1.7, and 2.4 mIoU for budgets of 5%, 10%, and 20%, respectively. Additionally, the focus on minority classes leads to improvements of the minimum class performance of 0.5, 2.9, and 4.6 IoU respectively. The top-performing model even exceeds the fully supervised baseline, showing that a more balanced label than the entire ground truth can be beneficial.",

      "abstract": "As LLMs continue to increase in parameter size, the computational resources required to run them are available to fewer parties. Therefore, third-party inference services -- where LLMs are hosted by third parties with significant computational resources -- are becoming increasingly popular. However, third party inference raises critical concerns about user data privacy. To mitigate these risks, privacy researchers have developed provably secure schemes for third-party inference, such as Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC). However, SMPC protocols have significant computational and communication overhead, and do not scale to large models. In this work, we propose a new multi-party inference protocol, Cascade, that avoids these punitive costs by leveraging sharding in the sequence dimension to maintain privacy, trading off cryptographic privacy guarantees for increased performance and scalability. We demonstrate that Cascade is resistant to a generalization of a recent attack that is highly effective against other statistical privacy schemes, and that it is further resistant to learning-based attacks. As Cascade is orders of magnitude faster than existing schemes, our findings offer practical solutions for secure deployment of modern state-of-the-art LLMs.",

In this study, we explore a hybrid vision transformer, the Convolution vision Transformer (CvT), which combines the benefits of vision transformers (ViTs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We use this approach to infer the $Ω_m$ and $σ_8$ cosmological parameters from simulated dark matter and halo fields. Our experiments indicate that the constraints on $Ω_m$ and $σ_8$ obtained using CvT are better than ViT and CNN, using either dark matter or halo fields. For CvT, pretraining on dark matter fields proves advantageous for improving constraints using halo fields compared to training a model from the beginning. However, ViT and CNN do not show these benefits. The CvT is more efficient than ViT since, despite having more parameters, it requires a training time similar to that of ViT and has similar inference times.

      "abstract": "In a variety of applications, including nonparametric instrumental variable (NPIV) analysis, proximal causal inference under unmeasured confounding, and missing-not-at-random data with shadow variables, we are interested in inference on a continuous linear functional (e.g., average causal effects) of nuisance function (e.g., NPIV regression) defined by conditional moment restrictions. These nuisance functions are generally weakly identified, in that the conditional moment restrictions can be severely ill-posed as well as admit multiple solutions. This is sometimes resolved by imposing strong conditions that imply the function can be estimated at rates that make inference on the functional possible. In this paper, we study a novel condition for the functional to be strongly identified even when the nuisance function is not; that is, the functional is amenable to asymptotically-normal estimation at $\\sqrt{n}$-rates. The condition implies the existence of debiasing nuisance functions, and we propose penalized minimax estimators for both the primary and debiasing nuisance functions. The proposed nuisance estimators can accommodate flexible function classes, and importantly they can converge to fixed limits determined by the penalization regardless of the identifiability of the nuisances. We use the penalized nuisance estimators to form a debiased estimator for the functional of interest and prove its asymptotic normality under generic high-level conditions, which provide for asymptotically valid confidence intervals. We also illustrate our method in a novel partially linear proximal causal inference problem and a partially linear instrumental variable regression problem.",

A critical challenge encountered is that of limited availability of ground truth information (e.g., labels in classification tasks) as new data are observed one-by-one online, while another significant challenge is that of class imbalance. This work introduces the novel Augmented Queues method, which addresses the dual-problem by combining in a synergistic manner online active learning, data augmentation, and a multi-queue memory to maintain separate and balanced queues for each class. We perform an extensive experimental study using image and time-series augmentations, in which we examine the roles of the active learning budget, memory size, imbalance level, and neural network type. We demonstrate two major advantages of Augmented Queues. First, it does not reserve additional memory space as the generation of synthetic data occurs only at training times. Second, learning models have access to more labelled data without the need to increase the active learning budget and / or the original memory size. Learning on-the-fly poses major challenges which, typically, hinder the deployment of learning models. Augmented Queues significantly improves the performance in terms of learning quality and speed.

We contribute by showing how valid semiparametric inference can be obtained in the presence of unobserved confounders and high-dimensional nuisance models. We propose uncertainty intervals which allow for unobserved confounding, and show that the resulting inference is valid when the amount of unobserved confounding is small relative to the sample size; the latter is formalized in terms of convergence rates. Simulation experiments illustrate the finite sample properties of the proposed intervals and investigate an alternative procedure that improves the empirical coverage of the intervals when the amount of unobserved confounding is large. Finally, a case study on the effect of smoking during pregnancy on birth weight is used to illustrate the use of the methods introduced to perform a sensitivity analysis to unobserved confounding.",

Kepler-71 is a star with 0.923Ms and 0.816Rs orbited by the hot Jupiter planet Kepler-71b with radius of 1.0452RJ. The physical parameters of the starspots are determined by fitting the data with a model that simulates planetary transits and enables the inclusion of spots on the stellar surface with different sizes, intensities, and positions. The results show that Kepler-71 is a very active star, with several spot detections, with a mean value of 6 spots per transit with size 0.6Rp and 0.5 Ic, as a function of stellar intensity at disk center (maximum value).",

These two views differs conceptually and mathematically, resulting in different sampling variances of the usual difference-in-means estimator of the average causal effect. Practically, however, these two views result in identical variance estimators. By recalling a variance decomposition and exploiting a completeness-type argument, we establish a connection between these two views in completely randomized experiments. This alternative formulation could serve as a template for bridging finite and super population causal inference in other scenarios.",

Although the absence of weight tuning prevents leakage via model parameters, it introduces the risk of inference adversaries exploiting retrieved documents in the model's context. Existing methods for membership inference and data extraction often rely on jailbreaking or carefully crafted unnatural queries, which can be easily detected or thwarted with query rewriting techniques common in RAG systems. In this work, we present Interrogation Attack (IA), a membership inference technique targeting documents in the RAG datastore. By crafting natural-text queries that are answerable only with the target document's presence, our approach demonstrates successful inference with just 30 queries while remaining stealthy; straightforward detectors identify adversarial prompts from existing methods up to ~76x more frequently than those generated by our attack. We observe a 2x improvement in TPR@1%FPR over prior inference attacks across diverse RAG configurations, all while costing less than $0.02 per document inference.",

We then describe ``externally parameterized'' statistical games, and use them to construct two approximate inference doctrines found in the computational neuroscience literature, which we call the `Laplace' and the `Hebb-Laplace' doctrines: the former produces dynamical systems which optimize the posteriors of Gaussian models; and the latter produces systems which additionally optimize the parameters (or `weights') which determine their predictions.",

      "abstract": "Active inference is an ambitious theory that treats perception, inference and action selection of autonomous agents under the heading of a single principle. It suggests biologically plausible explanations for many cognitive phenomena, including consciousness. In active inference, action selection is driven by an objective function that evaluates possible future actions with respect to current, inferred beliefs about the world. Active inference at its core is independent from extrinsic rewards, resulting in a high level of robustness across e.g.\\ different environments or agent morphologies. In the literature, paradigms that share this independence have been summarised under the notion of intrinsic motivations. In general and in contrast to active inference, these models of motivation come without a commitment to particular inference and action selection mechanisms. In this article, we study if the inference and action selection machinery of active inference can also be used by alternatives to the originally included intrinsic motivation. The perception-action loop explicitly relates inference and action selection to the environment and agent memory, and is consequently used as foundation for our analysis. We reconstruct the active inference approach, locate the original formulation within, and show how alternative intrinsic motivations can be used while keeping many of the original features intact. Furthermore, we illustrate the connection to universal reinforcement learning by means of our formalism. Active inference research may profit from comparisons of the dynamics induced by alternative intrinsic motivations. Research on intrinsic motivations may profit from an additional way to implement intrinsically motivated agents that also share the biological plausibility of active inference.",

As a result, there is an emerging need for online learning methods that train predictive models on-the-fly. A series of open challenges, however, hinder their deployment in practice. These are, learning as data arrive in real-time one-by-one, learning from data with limited ground truth information, learning from nonstationary data, and learning from severely imbalanced data, while occupying a limited amount of memory for data storage. We propose the ActiSiamese algorithm, which addresses these challenges by combining online active learning, siamese networks, and a multi-queue memory. It develops a new density-based active learning strategy which considers similarity in the latent (rather than the input) space. We conduct an extensive study that compares the role of different active learning budgets and strategies, the performance with/without memory, the performance with/without ensembling, in both synthetic and real-world datasets, under different data nonstationarity characteristics and class imbalance levels. ActiSiamese outperforms baseline and state-of-the-art algorithms, and is effective under severe imbalance, even only when a fraction of the arriving instances' labels is available.

Building on our previous work exploring the relationship between active inference, well-being, resilience, and sustainability, we present a computational model of an agent learning sustainable resource management strategies in both static and dynamic environments. The agent's behavior emerges from optimizing its own well-being, represented by prior preferences, subject to beliefs about environmental dynamics. In a static environment, the agent learns to consistently consume resources to satisfy its needs. In a dynamic environment where resources deplete and replenish based on the agent's actions, the agent adapts its behavior to balance immediate needs with long-term resource availability. This demonstrates how active inference can give rise to sustainable and resilient behaviors in the face of changing environmental conditions. We discuss the implications of our model, its limitations, and suggest future directions for integrating more complex agent-environment interactions.

The velocity or stress at the edge of the boundary layer determines the exterior fluid flow and, hence, the many-body interparticle hydrodynamic interaction. Here, we present a method to compute the many-body hydrodynamic interaction between $N$ spherical active particles induced by their exterior microhydrodynamic flow. First, we use a boundary integral representation of the Stokes equation to eliminate bulk fluid degrees of freedom. Then, we expand the boundary velocities and tractions of the integral representation in an infinite-dimensional basis of tensorial spherical harmonics and, on enforcing boundary conditions in a weak sense on the surface of each particle, obtain a system of linear algebraic equations for the unknown expansion coefficients. The truncation of the infinite series, fixed by the degree of accuracy required, yields a finite linear system that can be solved accurately and efficiently by iterative methods. The solution linearly relates the unknown rigid body motion to the known values of the expansion coefficients, motivating the introduction of propulsion matrices. These matrices completely characterize hydrodynamic interactions in active suspensions just as mobility matrices completely characterize hydrodynamic interactions in passive suspensions. The reduction in the dimensionality of the problem, from a three-dimensional partial differential equation to a two-dimensional integral equation, allows for dynamic simulations of hundreds of thousands of active particles on multi-core computational architectures.",

When secondary information about options is accessible, such problems can be framed as contextual multi-armed bandits (CMABs). Neuro-inspired active inference has gained interest for its ability to balance exploration and exploitation using the expected free energy objective function. Unlike previous studies that showed the effectiveness of active inference based strategy for CMABs using synthetic data, this study aims to apply active inference to realistic scenarios, using a simulated mineralogical survey site selection problem. Hyperspectral data from AVIRIS-NG at Cuprite, Nevada, serves as contextual information for predicting outcome probabilities, while geologists' mineral labels represent outcomes. Monte Carlo simulations assess the robustness of active inference against changing expert preferences. Results show that active inference requires fewer iterations than standard bandit approaches with real-world noisy and biased data, and performs better when outcome preferences vary online by adapting the selection strategy to align with expert shifts.",

      "abstract": "This paper serves as a starting point for machine learning researchers, engineers and students who are interested in but not yet familiar with causal inference. We start by laying out an important set of assumptions that are collectively needed for causal identification, such as exchangeability, positivity, consistency and the absence of interference. From these assumptions, we build out a set of important causal inference techniques, which we do so by categorizing them into two buckets; active and passive approaches. We describe and discuss randomized controlled trials and bandit-based approaches from the active category. We then describe classical approaches, such as matching and inverse probability weighting, in the passive category, followed by more recent deep learning based algorithms. By finishing the paper with some of the missing aspects of causal inference from this paper, such as collider biases, we expect this paper to provide readers with a diverse set of starting points for further reading and research in causal inference and discovery.",

      "abstract": "Oblivious inference is the task of outsourcing a ML model, like neural-networks, without disclosing critical and sensitive information, like the model's parameters. One of the most prominent solutions for secure oblivious inference is based on a powerful cryptographic tools, like Homomorphic Encryption (HE) and/or multi-party computation (MPC). Even though the implementation of oblivious inference systems schemes has impressively improved the last decade, there are still significant limitations on the ML models that they can practically implement. Especially when both the ML model and the input data's confidentiality must be protected. In this paper, we introduce the notion of partially oblivious inference. We empirically show that for neural network models, like CNNs, some information leakage can be acceptable. We therefore propose a novel trade-off between security and efficiency. In our research, we investigate the impact on security and inference runtime performance from the CNN model's weights partial leakage. We experimentally demonstrate that in a CIFAR-10 network we can leak up to $80\\%$ of the model's weights with practically no security impact, while the necessary HE-mutliplications are performed four times faster.",

      "abstract": "We discuss how the method of maximum entropy, MaxEnt, can be extended beyond its original scope, as a rule to assign a probability distribution, to a full-fledged method for inductive inference. The main concept is the (relative) entropy S[p|q] which is designed as a tool to update from a prior probability distribution q to a posterior probability distribution p when new information in the form of a constraint becomes available. The extended method goes beyond the mere selection of a single posterior p, but also addresses the question of how much less probable other distributions might be. Our approach clarifies how the entropy S[p|q] is used while avoiding the question of its meaning. Ultimately, entropy is a tool for induction which needs no interpretation. Finally, being a tool for generalization from special examples, we ask whether the functional form of the entropy depends on the choice of the examples and we find that it does. The conclusion is that there is no single general theory of inductive inference and that alternative expressions for the entropy are possible.",

The regression models used by these sensors often require a large number of labeled examples, yet obtaining the label information can be very expensive given the high time and cost required by quality inspections. In this context, active learning methods can be highly beneficial as they can suggest the most informative labels to query. However, most of the active learning strategies proposed for regression focus on the offline setting. In this work, we adapt some of these approaches to the stream-based scenario and show how they can be used to select the most informative data points. We also demonstrate how to use a semi-supervised architecture based on orthogonal autoencoders to learn salient features in a lower dimensional space.

We benchmark these systems across multiple dimensions including throughput performance, end-to-end latency, GPU memory utilization, and scalability characteristics using LLaMA-2 models ranging from 7B to 70B parameters. Our experiments reveal that vLLM achieves up to 24x higher throughput than TGI under high-concurrency workloads through its novel PagedAttention mechanism, while TGI demonstrates lower tail latencies for interactive single-user scenarios. We provide detailed performance profiles for different deployment scenarios and offer practical recommendations for system selection based on workload characteristics. Our findings indicate that the choice between these frameworks should be guided by specific use-case requirements: vLLM excels in high-throughput batch processing scenarios, while TGI is better suited for latency-sensitive interactive applications with moderate concurrency.",

We propose a joint computing and communication design to minimize the maximum computational latency (MCL), subject to both the phase shift constraints and the edge computing capability constraints. Specifically, the original problem is decoupled into four subproblems, and then the block coordinate descent (BCD) method and the successive convex approximation (SCA) method are applied to alternately optimize the subproblems. The simulation results show that with the same power budget, the performance gain achieved by the active RIS is much larger than that by the passive RIS.",

AL research suffers from the fact that lifts from literature generalize poorly and that only a small number of repetitions of experiments are conducted. To overcome these obstacles, we propose CDALBench, the first active learning benchmark which includes tasks in computer vision, natural language processing and tabular learning. Furthermore, by providing an efficient, greedy oracle, CDALBench can be evaluated with 50 runs for each experiment. We show, that both the cross-domain character and a large amount of repetitions are crucial for sophisticated evaluation of AL research. Concretely, we show that the superiority of specific methods varies over the different domains, making it important to evaluate Active Learning with a cross-domain benchmark. Additionally, we show that having a large amount of runs is crucial. With only conducting three runs as often done in the literature, the superiority of specific methods can strongly vary with the specific runs. This effect is so strong, that, depending on the seed, even a well-established method's performance can be significantly better and significantly worse than random for the same dataset.",

We can expect interactions between the star and the exoplanet for such systems that are similar to the tidal interactions observed in close stellar binary systems. For the exoplanet, tidal interaction can lead to circularization of its orbit and the synchronization of its rotational and orbital period. For the host star, it has long been speculated if significant angular momentum transfer can take place between the planetary orbit and the stellar rotation. In the case of the Earth-Moon system, such tidal interaction has led to an increasing distance between Earth and Moon. For stars with Hot Jupiters, where the orbital period of the exoplanet is typically shorter than the stellar rotation period, one expects a decreasing semimajor axis for the planet and enhanced stellar rotation, leading to increased stellar activity. Also excess turbulence in the stellar convective zone due to rising and subsiding tidal bulges may change the magnetic activity we observe for the host star. Here I review recent observational results on stellar activity and tidal interaction in the presence of close-in exoplanets, and discuss the effects of enhanced stellar activity on the exoplanets in such systems.",

It employs a theoretically grounded local search via annealed Langevin MCMC and performs compute-efficient global exploration using breadth-first and depth-first tree search. We evaluate our approach on a range of challenging domains, including planning, offline reinforcement learning, and image generation.

      "abstract": "Matching in observational studies faces complications when units enroll in treatment on a rolling basis. While each treated unit has a specific time of entry into the study, control units each have many possible comparison, or \"pseudo-treatment,\" times. The recent GroupMatch framework (Pimentel et al., 2020) solves this problem by searching over all possible pseudo-treatment times for each control and selecting those permitting the closest matches based on covariate histories. However, valid methods of inference have been described only for special cases of the general GroupMatch design, and these rely on strong assumptions. We provide three important innovations to address these problems. First, we introduce a new design, GroupMatch with instance replacement, that allows additional flexibility in control selection and proves more amenable to analysis. Second, we propose a block bootstrap approach for inference in GroupMatch with instance replacement and demonstrate that it accounts properly for complex correlations across matched sets. Third, we develop a permutation-based falsification test to detect possible violations of the important timepoint agnosticism assumption underpinning GroupMatch, which requires homogeneity of potential outcome means across time. Via simulation and a case study of the impact of short-term injuries on batting performance in major league baseball, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods for data analysis in practice.",

      "abstract": "Active inference is a theory of perception, learning and decision making, which can be applied to neuroscience, robotics, and machine learning. Recently, reasearch has been taking place to scale up this framework using Monte-Carlo tree search and deep learning. The goal of this activity is to solve more complicated tasks using deep active inference. First, we review the existing literature, then, we progresively build a deep active inference agent. For two agents, we have experimented with five definitions of the expected free energy and three different action selection strategies. According to our experiments, the models able to solve the dSprites environment are the ones that maximise rewards. Finally, we compare the similarity of the representation learned by the layers of various agents using centered kernel alignment. Importantly, the agent maximising reward and the agent minimising expected free energy learn very similar representations except for the last layer of the critic network (reflecting the difference in learning objective), and the variance layers of the transition and encoder networks. We found that the reward maximising agent is a lot more certain than the agent minimising expected free energy. This is because the agent minimising expected free energy always picks the action down, and does not gather enough data for the other actions. In contrast, the agent maximising reward, keeps on selecting the actions left and right, enabling it to successfully solve the task. The only difference between those two agents is the epistemic value, which aims to make the outputs of the transition and encoder networks as close as possible. Thus, the agent minimising expected free energy picks a single action (down), and becomes an expert at predicting the future when selecting this action. This makes the KL divergence between the output of the transition and encoder networks small.",

      "abstract": "The Gaussian process state-space models (GPSSMs) represent a versatile class of data-driven nonlinear dynamical system models. However, the presence of numerous latent variables in GPSSM incurs unresolved issues for existing variational inference approaches, particularly under the more realistic non-mean-field (NMF) assumption, including extensive training effort, compromised inference accuracy, and infeasibility for online applications, among others. In this paper, we tackle these challenges by incorporating the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), a well-established model-based filtering technique, into the NMF variational inference framework to approximate the posterior distribution of the latent states. This novel marriage between EnKF and GPSSM not only eliminates the need for extensive parameterization in learning variational distributions, but also enables an interpretable, closed-form approximation of the evidence lower bound (ELBO). Moreover, owing to the streamlined parameterization via the EnKF, the new GPSSM model can be easily accommodated in online learning applications. We demonstrate that the resulting EnKF-aided online algorithm embodies a principled objective function by ensuring data-fitting accuracy while incorporating model regularizations to mitigate overfitting. We also provide detailed analysis and fresh insights for the proposed algorithms. Comprehensive evaluation across diverse real and synthetic datasets corroborates the superior learning and inference performance of our EnKF-aided variational inference algorithms compared to existing methods.",

The proposed method is based on active inference, a promising neuroscientific theory of the brain, which describes a biologically plausible algorithm for perception and action. In this work, we formulate active inference from a control perspective, deriving a model-free control law which is less sensitive to unmodeled dynamics. The performance and the adaptive properties of the algorithm are compared to a state-of-the-art model reference adaptive controller (MRAC) in an experimental setup with a real 7-DOF robot arm. The results showed that the AIC outperformed the MRAC in terms of adaptability, providing a more general control law. This confirmed the relevance of active inference for robot control.",

However, unlike image classification, it is unintuitive for humans to label image patches with physical properties. Without labeled data, building a vision system that takes as input the observed terrain and predicts physical properties remains challenging. We present a method that overcomes this challenge by self-supervised labeling of images captured by robots during real-world traversal with physical property estimators trained in simulation. To ensure accurate labeling, we introduce Active Sensing Motor Policies (ASMP), which are trained to explore locomotion behaviors that increase the accuracy of estimating physical parameters. For instance, the quadruped robot learns to swipe its foot against the ground to estimate the friction coefficient accurately. We show that the visual system trained with a small amount of real-world traversal data accurately predicts physical parameters. The trained system is robust and works even with overhead images captured by a drone despite being trained on data collected by cameras attached to a quadruped robot walking on the ground.",

However, the influence of active rotations in the absence of self-propulsion i.e. spinning without walking) remains less explored. Here, we numerically and theoretically investigate the behaviour of ensembles of self-spinning dimers. We find that geometric frustration of dimer rotation by interactions yields spatiotemporal order and active melting with no equilibrium counterparts. At low density, the spinning dimers self-assemble into a triangular lattice with their orientations phase-locked into spatially periodic phases. The phase-locked patterns form dynamical analogues of the ground states of various spin models, transitioning from the 3-state Potts antiferromagnet at low densities to the striped herringbone phase of planar quadrupoles at higher densities. As the density is raised further, the competition between active rotations and interactions leads to melting of the active spinner crystal. Emergent edge currents, whose direction is set by the chirality of the active spinning, arise as a non-equilibrium signature of the transition to the active spinner liquid and vanish when the system eventually undergoes kinetic arrest at very high densities. Our findings may be realized in systems ranging from liquid crystal and colloidal experiments to tabletop realizations using macroscopic chiral grains.",

      "abstract": "Inferring topological characteristics of complex networks from observed data is critical to understand the dynamical behavior of networked systems, ranging from the Internet and the World Wide Web to biological networks and social networks. Prior studies usually focus on the structure-based estimation to infer network sizes, degree distributions, average degrees, and more. Little effort attempted to estimate the specific degree of each vertex from a sampled induced graph, which prevents us from measuring the lethality of nodes in protein networks and influencers in social networks. The current approaches dramatically fail for a tiny sampled induced graph and require a specific sampling method and a large sample size. These approaches neglect information of the vertex state, representing the dynamical behavior of the networked system, such as the biomass of species or expression of a gene, which is useful for degree estimation. We fill this gap by developing a framework to infer individual vertex degrees using both information of the sampled topology and vertex state. We combine the mean-field theory with combinatorial optimization to learn vertex degrees. Experimental results on real networks with a variety of dynamics demonstrate that our framework can produce reliable degree estimates and dramatically improve existing link prediction methods by replacing the sampled degrees with our estimated degrees.",

These object-based representations form a natural basis for planning behavior. Active inference (AIF) is an influential unifying account of perception and action, but existing AIF models have not leveraged this important inductive bias. To remedy this, we introduce 'object-based active inference' (OBAI), marrying AIF with recent deep object-based neural networks. OBAI represents distinct objects with separate variational beliefs, and uses selective attention to route inputs to their corresponding object slots. Object representations are endowed with independent action-based dynamics. The dynamics and generative model are learned from experience with a simple environment (active multi-dSprites). We show that OBAI learns to correctly segment the action-perturbed objects from video input, and to manipulate these objects towards arbitrary goals.",

To investigate this claim, we present multiple examples that challenge the subsumption thesis. To formally compare these two accounts of agency, we analyze the objective functions for MDPs and POMDPs. By imposing information-theoretic rationality bounds (ITBR) on the expected utility agent, we find that the resultant agency is equivalent to that of active inference in MDPs, but slightly different in POMDPs. Rather than being strictly resolved, the subsumption thesis motivates the construction of a formal bridge between active inference and expected utility. This highlights the necessary formal assumptions and frameworks to make these disparate accounts of agency commensurable.",

Model-based planning and prospection are widely studied in cognitive neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI), but from different perspectives--and with different desiderata in mind (biological realism versus scalability) that are difficult to reconcile. Here, we introduce a novel method to plan in POMDPs--Active Inference Tree Search (AcT)--that combines the normative character and biological realism of a leading planning theory in neuroscience (Active Inference) and the scalability of tree search methods in AI. This unification enhances both approaches. On the one hand, tree searches enable the biologically grounded, first principle method of active inference to be applied to large-scale problems. On the other hand, active inference provides a principled solution to the exploration-exploitation dilemma, which is often addressed heuristically in tree search methods. Our simulations show that AcT successfully navigates binary trees that are challenging for sampling-based methods, problems that require adaptive exploration, and the large POMDP problem 'RockSample'--in which AcT reproduces state-of-the-art POMDP solutions. Furthermore, we illustrate how AcT can be used to simulate neurophysiological responses (e.g., in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex) of humans and other animals that solve large planning problems. These numerical analyses show that Active Tree Search is a principled realisation of neuroscientific and AI planning theories, which offer both biological realism and scalability.",

      "abstract": "In causal inference, whether through randomized controlled trials or observational studies, access to both treated and control units is essential for estimating the effect of a treatment on an outcome of interest. When treatment assignment is random, the average treatment effect (ATE) can be estimated directly by comparing outcomes between groups. In non-randomized settings, various techniques are employed to adjust for confounding and approximate the counterfactual scenario to recover an unbiased ATE. A common challenge, especially in observational studies, is the absence of units clearly labeled as controls-that is, units known not to have received the treatment. To address this, we propose positive-unlabeled (PU) learning as a framework for identifying, with high confidence, control units from a pool of unlabeled ones, using only the available treated (positive) units. We evaluate this approach using both simulated and real-world data. We construct a causal graph with diverse relationships and use it to generate synthetic data under various scenarios, assessing how reliably the method recovers control groups that allow estimates of true ATE. We also apply our approach to real-world data on optimal sowing and fertilizer treatments in sustainable agriculture. Our findings show that PU learning can successfully identify control (negative) units from unlabeled data based only on treated units and, through the resulting control group, estimate an ATE that closely approximates the true value. This work has important implications for observational causal inference, especially in fields where randomized experiments are difficult or costly. In domains such as earth, environmental, and agricultural sciences, it enables a plethora of quasi-experiments by leveraging available earth observation and climate data, particularly when treated units are available but control units are lacking.",

In this paper, we introduce a unified framework that combines trajectory planning with multimodal predictions and active probing to enhance decision-making under uncertainty. We develop a novel risk metric that seamlessly integrates multimodal prediction uncertainties through mixture models. When these uncertainties follow a Gaussian mixture distribution, we prove that our risk metric admits a closed-form solution, and is always finite, thus ensuring analytical tractability. To reduce prediction ambiguity, we incorporate an active probing mechanism that strategically selects actions to improve its estimates of behavioral parameters of other agents, while simultaneously handling multimodal uncertainties. We extensively evaluate our framework in autonomous navigation scenarios using the MetaDrive simulation environment. Results demonstrate that our active probing approach successfully navigates complex traffic scenarios with uncertain predictions. Additionally, our framework shows robust performance across diverse traffic agent behavior models, indicating its broad applicability to real-world autonomous navigation challenges.

This is much larger the \"law of large numbers\" scaling $\\sqrt {<(δN)^2>} = K\\sqrt{<N>}$ found in most equilibrium and non-equilibrium systems. In further contrast to most other systems, the coefficient $K'$ also depends singularly on the shape of the box in which one counts the particles, vanishing in the limit of very thin boxes. These fluctuations arise {\\it not} from large density fluctuations - indeed, the density fluctuations in \\dry s are not in general particularly large - but from long ranged spatial correlations between those fluctuations. These are shown to be closely related in two spatial dimensions to the electrostatic potential near a sharp upward pointing conducting wedge of opening angle ${3π\\over8}=67.5^\\circ$, and in three dimensions to the electrostatic potential near a sharp upward pointing charged cone of opening angle $37.16^\\circ$. This very precise prediction can be stringently tested by alternative box counting experiments that directly measure this density-density correlation function.",

      "abstract": "Causal discovery and causal reasoning are classically treated as separate and consecutive tasks: one first infers the causal graph, and then uses it to estimate causal effects of interventions. However, such a two-stage approach is uneconomical, especially in terms of actively collected interventional data, since the causal query of interest may not require a fully-specified causal model. From a Bayesian perspective, it is also unnatural, since a causal query (e.g., the causal graph or some causal effect) can be viewed as a latent quantity subject to posterior inference -- other unobserved quantities that are not of direct interest (e.g., the full causal model) ought to be marginalized out in this process and contribute to our epistemic uncertainty. In this work, we propose Active Bayesian Causal Inference (ABCI), a fully-Bayesian active learning framework for integrated causal discovery and reasoning, which jointly infers a posterior over causal models and queries of interest. In our approach to ABCI, we focus on the class of causally-sufficient, nonlinear additive noise models, which we model using Gaussian processes. We sequentially design experiments that are maximally informative about our target causal query, collect the corresponding interventional data, and update our beliefs to choose the next experiment. Through simulations, we demonstrate that our approach is more data-efficient than several baselines that only focus on learning the full causal graph. This allows us to accurately learn downstream causal queries from fewer samples while providing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates for the quantities of interest.",

      "abstract": "Light-activated self-propelled colloids are synthesized and their active motion is studied using optical microscopy. We propose a versatile route using different photoactive materials, and demonstrate a multiwavelength activation and propulsion. Thanks to the photoelectrochemical properties of two semiconductor materials (αFe2 O3 and TiO2 ), a light with an energy higher than the bandgap triggers the reaction of decomposition of hydrogen peroxide and produces a chemical cloud around the particle. It induces a phoretic attraction with neighbouring colloids as well as an osmotic self- propulsion of the particle on the substrate. We use these mechanisms to form colloidal cargos as well as self-propelled particles where the light-activated component is embedded into a dielectric sphere. The particles are self-propelled along a direction otherwise randomized by thermal fluctuations, and exhibit a persistent random walk. For sufficient surface density, the particles spontaneously form \"living crystals\" which are mobile, break apart and reform. Steering the particle with an external magnetic field, we show that the formation of the dense phase results from the collisions heads-on of the particles. This effect is intrinsically non-equilibrium and a novel principle of organization for systems without detailed balance. Engineering families of particles self-propelled by different wavelength demonstrate a good understanding of both the physics and the chemistry behind the system and points to a general route for designing new families of self-propelled particles.",

      "abstract": "Many critical applications, from autonomous scientific discovery to personalized medicine, demand systems that can both strategically acquire the most informative data and instantaneously perform inference based upon it. While amortized methods for Bayesian inference and experimental design offer part of the solution, neither approach is optimal in the most general and challenging task, where new data needs to be collected for instant inference. To tackle this issue, we introduce the Amortized Active Learning and Inference Engine (ALINE), a unified framework for amortized Bayesian inference and active data acquisition. ALINE leverages a transformer architecture trained via reinforcement learning with a reward based on self-estimated information gain provided by its own integrated inference component. This allows it to strategically query informative data points while simultaneously refining its predictions. Moreover, ALINE can selectively direct its querying strategy towards specific subsets of model parameters or designated predictive tasks, optimizing for posterior estimation, data prediction, or a mixture thereof. Empirical results on regression-based active learning, classical Bayesian experimental design benchmarks, and a psychometric model with selectively targeted parameters demonstrate that ALINE delivers both instant and accurate inference along with efficient selection of informative points.",

The structure is defined by two layers of magnetic nanoelements where one layer is a square Artificial Spin Ice geometry. The other magnetic layer functions as a sensory filter that mediates interaction between the external environment and the hidden Artificial Spin Ice layer. Spin dynamics displayed by the bilayer structure are shown to be well described using a continuous form of a neurological free energy principle that has been previously proposed as a high level description of certain biological neural processes.

Such a framework allows the development of a Smoluchowski-like equation for the probability density of finding a particle at a given position and time, without assuming an explicit orientational dynamics of the self-propelling velocity as Langevin-like equation-based models do. Also, the Brownian motion due to thermal fluctuations and the active one due to a general intrinsic persistent motion of the particle are taken into consideration on an equal footing. The persistence of motion is introduced in our formalism in the form of a \\emph{two-time memory function}, $K(t,t^{\\prime})$. We focus on the consequences when $K(t,t^{\\prime})\\sim (t/t^{\\prime})^{-η}\\exp[-Γ(t-t^{\\prime})]$, $Γ$ being the characteristic persistence time, and show that it precisely describes a variety of active motion patterns characterized by $η$.

Up to now, the inference of the latent variables was carried out by taking advantage of the flexibility offered by Variational Message Passing (Winn and Bishop, 2005), an iterative process that can be understood as sending messages along the edges of a factor graph (Forney, 2001). In this paper, we harness the efficiency of an alternative method for inference called Bayesian Filtering (Fox et al., 2003), which does not require the iteration of the update equations until convergence of the Variational Free Energy. Instead, this scheme alternates between two phases: integration of evidence and prediction of future states. Both of those phases can be performed efficiently and this provides a seventy times speed up over the state-of-the-art.",

Fountas et al (2020) used Monte Carlo tree search to address this problem, leading to impressive results in two different tasks. In this paper, we present an alternative framework that aims to unify tree search and active inference by casting planning as a structure learning problem. Two tree search algorithms are then presented. The first propagates the expected free energy forward in time (i.e., towards the leaves), while the second propagates it backward (i.e., towards the root). Then, we demonstrate that forward and backward propagations are related to active inference and sophisticated inference, respectively, thereby clarifying the differences between those two planning strategies.",

Four representative active cardiac devices and a generic setup were analysed regarding volume and shape of the signal void. For analysis, a threshold operation applied to the grey value profle of each data data set was used. The presented approach allows the evaluation of signal void and shape even for larger implants such as ICDs. The void shape is influenced by the orientation of the B0-field and the chosen sequence type, as well as the distribution of magnetic material within the implants. The void volume depends both on the device itself, and the sequence type. Disturbances in the B0 and B1 fields exceed the visual signal void. This work presents a reproducible and highly defined approach towards characterising both signal void artifacts at 3.0T and their influencing factors.",

We propose SUGARL, Sensorimotor Understanding Guided Active Reinforcement Learning, a framework that models motor and sensory policies separately, but jointly learns them using with an intrinsic sensorimotor reward. This learnable reward is assigned by sensorimotor reward module, incentivizes the sensory policy to select observations that are optimal to infer its own motor action, inspired by the sensorimotor stage of humans. Through a series of experiments, we show the effectiveness of our method across a range of observability conditions and its adaptability to existed RL algorithms. The sensory policies learned through our method are observed to exhibit effective active vision strategies.",

      "abstract": "Active drops emit/absorb chemical solutes, whose concentration gradients cause interfacial flows driving their own transport and the propulsion of the droplet. Such non-linear coupling enables active drops to achieve directed self-propulsion despite their isotropy, if the ratio of advective-to-diffusive solute transport, i.e. the Peclet number Pe, is larger than a finite critical threshold. In most experimental situations, active drops are non-neutrally buoyant and thus swim along rigid surfaces; yet theoretical descriptions of their non-linear motion focus almost exclusively on unbounded domains to circumvent geometric complexity. To overcome this gap in understanding, we investigate the spontaneous emergence and nonlinear saturation of propulsion of an isotropic phoretic colloid along a rigid wall, to which it is confined by a constant external force (e.g., gravity). This phoretic particle model is considered here as a limiting case for a viscous active drop. We show that, for moderate Pe, the particle motion and associated chemical transport reduce the chemically-induced wall repulsion, thereby causing the particle to swim progressively closer to the wall as Pe increases. Far from hindering self-propulsion, this reduction in the particle-wall separation is accompanied by a wall-induced efficient rearrangement of the solute concentration gradients driving the particle, thus augmenting its swimming speed.",

Also, we present several alternative criteria, which may be useful for the evaluation of the active learning processes.

Existing methods of performing private third-party inference, such as Secure Multiparty Computation (SMPC), often rely on cryptographic methods. However, these methods are thousands of times slower than standard unencrypted inference, and fail to scale to large modern LLMs. Therefore, recent lines of work have explored the replacement of expensive encrypted nonlinear computations in SMPC with statistical obfuscation methods - in particular, revealing permuted hidden states to the third parties, with accompanying strong claims of the difficulty of reversal into the unpermuted states. In this work, we begin by introducing a novel reconstruction technique that can recover original prompts from hidden states with nearly perfect accuracy across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs. We then show that extensions of our attack are nearly perfectly effective in reversing permuted hidden states of LLMs, demonstrating the insecurity of three recently proposed privacy schemes. We further dissect the shortcomings of prior theoretical `proofs' of permuation security which allow our attack to succeed. Our findings highlight the importance of rigorous security analysis in privacy-preserving LLM inference.",

On the basis of multivariate Edgeworth expansion, we propose a non-Gaussian distribution in differential form to model a finite set of outputs from a random neural network, and derive the corresponding marginal and conditional properties. Thus, we are able to derive the non-Gaussian posterior distribution in Bayesian regression task.

Unfortunately, the complex mathematics required to create new models -- can impede application of active inference in neuroscience and AI research. This paper addresses this problem by providing a complete mathematical treatment of the active inference framework -- in discrete time and state spaces -- and the derivation of the update equations for any new model. We leverage the theoretical connection between active inference and variational message passing as describe by John Winn and Christopher M. Bishop in 2005. Since, variational message passing is a well-defined methodology for deriving Bayesian belief update equations, this paper opens the door to advanced generative models for active inference. We show that using a fully factorized variational distribution simplifies the expected free energy -- that furnishes priors over policies -- so that agents seek unambiguous states. Finally, we consider future extensions that support deep tree searches for sequential policy optimisation -- based upon structure learning and belief propagation.",

We frame the problem using survival analysis, focusing on the time to the earliest of several adverse events (early death, involuntary hospitalization, jail booking). We extend standard causal inference methods (T-learner, S-learner, nearest neighbor matching) to utilize various survival models to estimate individual and average treatment effects, where treatment corresponds to medication non-adherence. Analyses are repeated using different amounts of longitudinal information (3, 6, 9, and 12 months). Using data from Allegheny County in western Pennsylvania, we find strong evidence that non-adherence advances adverse outcomes by approximately 1 to 4 months. Ablation studies confirm that county-provided risk scores adjust for key confounders, as their removal amplifies the estimated effects. Subgroup analyses by medication formulation (injectable vs. oral) and medication type consistently show that non-adherence is associated with earlier adverse events. These findings highlight the clinical importance of adherence in delaying psychiatric crises and show that integrating survival analysis with causal inference tools can yield policy-relevant insights. We caution that although we apply causal inference, we only make associative claims and discuss assumptions needed for causal interpretation.",

Therefore, NNs need to be compressed to make them available to a wider audience and at the same time decrease their runtime costs. In this work, we approach this challenge from a causal inference perspective, and we propose a scoring mechanism to facilitate structured pruning of NNs. The approach is based on measuring mutual information under a maximum entropy perturbation, sequentially propagated through the NN.

Our BNN was trained on synthetic HST-quality images of strongly lensed active galactic nuclei (AGN) with lens galaxy light included. The BNN can accurately characterize the posterior PDFs of model parameters governing the elliptical power-law mass profile in an external shear field. We then propagate the BNN-inferred posterior PDFs into ensemble $H_0$ inference, using simulated time delay measurements from a plausible dedicated monitoring campaign. Assuming well-measured time delays and a reasonable set of priors on the environment of the lens, we achieve a median precision of $9.3$\\% per lens in the inferred $H_0$. A simple combination of 200 test-set lenses results in a precision of 0.5 $\\textrm{km s}^{-1} \\textrm{ Mpc}^{-1}$ ($0.7\\%$), with no detectable bias in this $H_0$ recovery test. The computation time for the entire pipeline -- including the training set generation, BNN training, and $H_0$ inference -- translates to 9 minutes per lens on average for 200 lenses and converges to 6 minutes per lens as the sample size is increased. Being fully automated and efficient, our pipeline is a promising tool for exploring ensemble-level systematics in lens modeling for $H_0$ inference.",

      "abstract": "Active inference provides a general framework for behavior and learning in autonomous agents. It states that an agent will attempt to minimize its variational free energy, defined in terms of beliefs over observations, internal states and policies. Traditionally, every aspect of a discrete active inference model must be specified by hand, i.e. by manually defining the hidden state space structure, as well as the required distributions such as likelihood and transition probabilities. Recently, efforts have been made to learn state space representations automatically from observations using deep neural networks. In this paper, we present a novel approach of learning state spaces using quantum physics-inspired tensor networks. The ability of tensor networks to represent the probabilistic nature of quantum states as well as to reduce large state spaces makes tensor networks a natural candidate for active inference. We show how tensor networks can be used as a generative model for sequential data. Furthermore, we show how one can obtain beliefs from such a generative model and how an active inference agent can use these to compute the expected free energy. Finally, we demonstrate our method on the classic T-maze environment.",

To understand early biofilm formation, beginning from planktonic states of active bacterial suspensions (such as Escherichia coli) to microcolonization, it is vital to study the mechanics of accumulation near surfaces and subsequent deposition. In this study, analytical expressions for the mean orientation, density and angular distributions, and deposition rates in such bacterial suspensions are derived, with and without the effects of external guiding or taxis fields. Simulations of confined active particles, using the run-and-tumble statistics from well-established three-dimensional tracking experiments and a preferential sticking probability model for deposition, closely verify the derived mean orientation, density profiles, angular distributions, and deposition rates. It is found that the size distribution of deposited microcolonies remains unaffected when guiding fields are applied, however, the pair correlation function of deposited structures relatively spreads out. The factor behind the changes in the accumulation patterns, and the changes in the architecture of deposited biomass, turns out to be an asymmetrical rotational drift caused by the guiding fields, and is an important physical mechanism behind the organization in confined active particle suspensions.",

      "abstract": "Active inference is a Bayesian framework for understanding biological intelligence. The underlying theory brings together perception and action under one single imperative: minimizing free energy. However, despite its theoretical utility in explaining intelligence, computational implementations have been restricted to low-dimensional and idealized situations. In this paper, we present a neural architecture for building deep active inference agents operating in complex, continuous state-spaces using multiple forms of Monte-Carlo (MC) sampling. For this, we introduce a number of techniques, novel to active inference. These include: i) selecting free-energy-optimal policies via MC tree search, ii) approximating this optimal policy distribution via a feed-forward `habitual' network, iii) predicting future parameter belief updates using MC dropouts and, finally, iv) optimizing state transition precision (a high-end form of attention). Our approach enables agents to learn environmental dynamics efficiently, while maintaining task performance, in relation to reward-based counterparts. We illustrate this in a new toy environment, based on the dSprites data-set, and demonstrate that active inference agents automatically create disentangled representations that are apt for modeling state transitions. In a more complex Animal-AI environment, our agents (using the same neural architecture) are able to simulate future state transitions and actions (i.e., plan), to evince reward-directed navigation - despite temporary suspension of visual input. These results show that deep active inference - equipped with MC methods - provides a flexible framework to develop biologically-inspired intelligent agents, with applications in both machine learning and cognitive science.",

Unlike reinforcement learning, active inference integrates exploration and exploitation seamlessly by minimizing expected free energy. In this paper, we present a continual learning framework for agents operating in discrete time environments, using active inference as the foundation. We derive the mathematical formulations of variational and expected free energy and apply them to the design of a self-learning research agent. This agent updates its beliefs and adapts its actions based on new data without manual intervention. Through experiments in changing environments, we demonstrate the agent's ability to relearn and refine its models efficiently, making it suitable for complex domains like finance and healthcare.

Both produce draws that can be used to compute consistent estimates, confidence intervals, and standard errors in a single run. The draws are generated by a gradient and Hessian (or an approximation) computed from batches of data that are resampled at each iteration. The proposed methods transition quickly from optimization to resampling when the objective is smooth and strictly convex.

In this paper we propose a solution which requires a careful trade off between the informativeness of the queried points and their diversity. We theoretically investigate batch active learning in the practically relevant scenario where the unlabeled pool of data is available beforehand ({\\em pool-based} active learning). We analyze a novel stage-wise greedy algorithm and show that, as a function of the label complexity, the excess risk of this algorithm matches the known minimax rates in standard statistical learning settings. Our results also exhibit a mild dependence on the batch size. These are the first theoretical results that employ careful trade offs between informativeness and diversity to rigorously quantify the statistical performance of batch active learning in the pool-based scenario.",

However, due to the \"multiplicative fading\" effect, the existing passive RISs only achieve a negligible capacity gain in environments with strong direct links. In this paper, the concept of active RISs is studied to overcome this fundamental limitation. Unlike the existing passive RISs that reflect signals without amplification, active RISs can amplify the reflected signals via amplifiers integrated into their elements. To characterize the signal amplification and incorporate the noise introduced by the active components, we verify the signal model of active RISs through the experimental measurements on a fabricated active RIS element. Based on the verified signal model, we formulate the sum-rate maximization problem for an active RIS aided multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) system and a joint transmit precoding and reflect beamforming algorithm is proposed to solve this problem. Simulation results show that, in a typical wireless system, the existing passive RISs can realize only a negligible sum-rate gain of 3%, while the active RISs can achieve a significant sum-rate gain of 62%, thus overcoming the \"multiplicative fading\" effect. Finally, we develop a 64-element active RIS aided wireless communication prototype, and the significant gain of active RISs is validated by field test.",

As a computational model deeply rooted in math and statistics, FEP posits an optimization problem based on variational Bayes, which is solved either by dynamic programming or expectation maximization in practice. However, there seems to be a bottleneck in extending the FEP to machine learning and implementing such models with neural networks. This paper gives a preliminary attempt at bridging FEP and machine learning, via a classical neural network model, the Helmholtz machine. As a variational machine learning model, the Helmholtz machine is optimized by minimizing its free energy, the same objective as FEP. Although the Helmholtz machine is not temporal, it gives an ideal parallel to the vanilla FEP and the hierarchical model of the brain, under which the active inference and predictive coding could be formulated coherently. Besides a detailed theoretical discussion, the paper also presents a preliminary experiment to validate the hypothesis. By fine-tuning the trained neural network through active inference, the model performance is promoted to accuracy above 99\\%. In the meantime, the data distribution is continuously deformed to a salience that conforms to the model representation, as a result of active sampling.",

Recently, active inference has been proposed as part of a new and unifying framework in the cognitive sciences: predictive processing. Predictive processing is often associated with traditional computational theories of the mind, strongly relying on internal representations presented in the form of generative models thought to explain different functions of living and cognitive systems. In this work, we introduce an active inference formulation of the Watt centrifugal governor, a system often portrayed as the canonical \"anti-representational\" metaphor for cognition. We identify a generative model of a steam engine for the governor, and derive a set of equations describing \"perception\" and \"action\" processes as a form of prediction error minimisation. In doing so, we firstly challenge the idea of generative models as explicit internal representations for cognitive systems, suggesting that such models serve only as implicit descriptions for an observer. Secondly, we consider current proposals of predictive processing as a theory of cognition, focusing on some of its potential shortcomings and in particular on the idea that virtually any system admits a description in terms of prediction error minimisation, suggesting that this theory may offer limited explanatory power for cognitive systems. Finally, as a silver lining we emphasise the instrumental role this framework can nonetheless play as a mathematical tool for modelling cognitive architectures interpreted in terms of Bayesian (active) inference.",

      "abstract": "We propose a very fast approximate Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling framework that is applicable to a large class of sparse Bayesian inference problems, where the computational cost per iteration in several models is of order $O(ns)$, where $n$ is the sample size, and $s$ the underlying sparsity of the model. This cost can be further reduced by data sub-sampling when stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics are employed. The algorithm is an extension of the asynchronous Gibbs sampler of Johnson et al. (2013), but can be viewed from a statistical perspective as a form of Bayesian iterated sure independent screening (Fan et al. (2009)). We show that in high-dimensional linear regression problems, the Markov chain generated by the proposed algorithm admits an invariant distribution that recovers correctly the main signal with high probability under some statistical assumptions. Furthermore we show that its mixing time is at most linear in the number of regressors. We illustrate the algorithm with several models.",

      "abstract": "The rising demand for networked embedded systems with machine intelligence has been a catalyst for sustained attempts by the research community to implement Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) based inferencing on embedded resource-limited devices. Redesigning a CNN by removing costly multiplication operations has already shown promising results in terms of reducing inference energy usage. This paper proposes a new method for replacing multiplications in a CNN by table look-ups. Unlike existing methods that completely modify the CNN operations, the proposed methodology preserves the semantics of the major CNN operations. Conforming to the existing mechanism of the CNN layer operations ensures that the reliability of a standard CNN is preserved. It is shown that the proposed multiplication-free CNN, based on a single activation codebook, can achieve 4.7x, 5.6x, and 3.5x reduction in energy per inference in an FPGA implementation of MNIST-LeNet-5, CIFAR10-VGG-11, and Tiny ImageNet-ResNet-18 respectively. Our results show that the DietCNN approach significantly improves the resource consumption and latency of deep inference for smaller models, often used in embedded systems.

      "abstract": "We describe a framework of hybrid cognition by formulating a hybrid cognitive agent that performs hierarchical active inference across a human and a machine part. We suggest that, in addition to enhancing human cognitive functions with an intelligent and adaptive interface, integrated cognitive processing could accelerate emergent properties within artificial intelligence. To establish this, a machine learning part learns to integrate into human cognition by explaining away multi-modal sensory measurements from the environment and physiology simultaneously with the brain signal. With ongoing training, the amount of predictable brain signal increases. This lends the agent the ability to self-supervise on increasingly high levels of cognitive processing in order to further minimize surprise in predicting the brain signal. Furthermore, with increasing level of integration, the access to sensory information about environment and physiology is substituted with access to their representation in the brain. While integrating into a joint embodiment of human and machine, human action and perception are treated as the machine's own. The framework can be implemented with invasive as well as non-invasive sensors for environment, body and brain interfacing. Online and offline training with different machine learning approaches are thinkable. Building on previous research on shared representation learning, we suggest a first implementation leading towards hybrid active inference with non-invasive brain interfacing and state of the art probabilistic deep learning methods. We further discuss how implementation might have effect on the meta-cognitive abilities of the described agent and suggest that with adequate implementation the machine part can continue to execute and build upon the learned cognitive processes autonomously.",

      "abstract": "Recursive Bayesian inference (RBI) provides optimal Bayesian latent variable estimates in real-time settings with streaming noisy observations. Active RBI attempts to effectively select queries that lead to more informative observations to rapidly reduce uncertainty until a confident decision is made. However, typically the optimality objectives of inference and query mechanisms are not jointly selected. Furthermore, conventional active querying methods stagger due to misleading prior information. Motivated by information theoretic approaches, we propose an active RBI framework with unified inference and query selection steps through Renyi entropy and $α$-divergence. We also propose a new objective based on Renyi entropy and its changes called Momentum that encourages exploration for misleading prior cases. The proposed active RBI framework is applied to the trajectory of the posterior changes in the probability simplex that provides a coordinated active querying and decision making with specified confidence. Under certain assumptions, we analytically demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms conventional methods such as mutual information by allowing the selections of unlikely events. We present empirical and experimental performance evaluations on two applications: restaurant recommendation and brain-computer interface (BCI) typing systems.",

Nonetheless, the so-called `constant' in the rate of convergence, which is characterized by a distribution-dependent risk, can be improved in many cases.

Traditional autonomous driving systems rely heavily on Modular Pipelines, Imitation Learning, or Reinforcement Learning, each with inherent limitations in adaptability, generalization, and computational efficiency. Active inference addresses these challenges by minimizing prediction error (termed \"surprise\") through a dynamic model that balances perception and action. Our method integrates active inference with deep learning to manage lateral control in AVs, enabling them to perform lane following maneuvers within a simulated urban environment. We demonstrate that our model, despite its simplicity, effectively learns and generalizes from limited data without extensive retraining, significantly reducing computational demands. The proposed approach not only enhances the adaptability and performance of AVs in dynamic scenarios but also aligns closely with human-like driving behavior, leveraging a generative model to predict and adapt to environmental changes. Results from extensive experiments in the CARLA simulator show promising outcomes, outperforming traditional methods in terms of adaptability and efficiency, thereby advancing the potential of active inference in real-world autonomous driving applications.",

      "abstract": "Active inference is a state-of-the-art framework for modelling the brain that explains a wide range of mechanisms such as habit formation, dopaminergic discharge and curiosity. However, recent implementations suffer from an exponential complexity class when computing the prior over all the possible policies up to the time horizon. Fountas et al (2020) used Monte Carlo tree search to address this problem, leading to very good results in two different tasks. Additionally, Champion et al (2021a) proposed a tree search approach based on (temporal) structure learning. This was enabled by the development of a variational message passing approach to active inference, which enables compositional construction of Bayesian networks for active inference. However, this message passing tree search approach, which we call branching-time active inference (BTAI), has never been tested empirically. In this paper, we present an experimental study of BTAI in the context of a maze solving agent. In this context, we show that both improved prior preferences and deeper search help mitigate the vulnerability to local minima. Then, we compare BTAI to standard active inference (AcI) on a graph navigation task. We show that for small graphs, both BTAI and AcI successfully solve the task. For larger graphs, AcI exhibits an exponential (space) complexity class, making the approach intractable. However, BTAI explores the space of policies more efficiently, successfully scaling to larger graphs. Then, BTAI was compared to the POMCP algorithm on the frozen lake environment. The experiments suggest that BTAI and the POMCP algorithm accumulate a similar amount of reward. Also, we describe when BTAI receives more rewards than the POMCP agent, and when the opposite is true. Finally, we compared BTAI to the approach of Fountas et al (2020) on the dSprites dataset, and we discussed the pros and cons of each approach.",

      "abstract": "Most applications of Bayesian Inference for parameter estimation and model selection in astrophysics involve the use of Monte Carlo techniques such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and nested sampling. However, these techniques are time consuming and their convergence to the posterior could be difficult to determine. In this work, we advocate Variational inference as an alternative to solve the above problems, and demonstrate its usefulness for parameter estimation and model selection in Astrophysics. Variational inference converts the inference problem into an optimization problem by approximating the posterior from a known family of distributions and using Kullback-Leibler divergence to characterize the difference. It takes advantage of fast optimization techniques, which make it ideal to deal with large datasets and makes it trivial to parallelize on a multicore platform. We also derive a new approximate evidence estimation based on variational posterior, and importance sampling technique called posterior weighted importance sampling for the calculation of evidence (PWISE), which is useful to perform Bayesian model selection. As a proof of principle, we apply variational inference to five different problems in astrophysics, where Monte Carlo techniques were previously used. These include assessment of significance of annual modulation in the COSINE-100 dark matter experiment, measuring exoplanet orbital parameters from radial velocity data, tests of periodicities in measurements of Newton's constant $G$, assessing the significance of a turnover in the spectral lag data of GRB 160625B and estimating the mass of a galaxy cluster using weak gravitational lensing. We find that variational inference is much faster than MCMC and nested sampling techniques for most of these problems while providing competitive results.

This framework combines Kalman-Bucy filters for the estimation of hidden states with Linear Quadratic Regulators for the control of their dynamics. Nowadays, LQG is also a common paradigm in neuroscience, where it is used to characterise different approaches to sensorimotor control based on state estimators, forward and inverse models. According to this paradigm, perception can be seen as a process of Bayesian inference and action as a process of optimal control. Recently, active inference has been introduced as a process theory derived from a variational approximation of Bayesian inference problems that describes, among others, perception and action in terms of (variational and expected) free energy minimisation. Active inference relies on a mathematical formalism similar to LQG, but offers a rather different perspective on problems of sensorimotor control in biological systems based on a process of biased perception. In this note we compare the mathematical treatments of these two frameworks for linear systems, focusing on their respective assumptions and highlighting their commonalities and technical differences.",

      "abstract": "Recent advances in theoretical biology suggest that basal cognition and sentient behaviour are emergent properties of in vitro cell cultures and neuronal networks, respectively. Such neuronal networks spontaneously learn structured behaviours in the absence of reward or reinforcement. In this paper, we characterise this kind of self-organisation through the lens of the free energy principle, i.e., as self-evidencing. We do this by first discussing the definitions of reactive and sentient behaviour in the setting of active inference, which describes the behaviour of agents that model the consequences of their actions. We then introduce a formal account of intentional behaviour, that describes agents as driven by a preferred endpoint or goal in latent state-spaces. We then investigate these forms of (reactive, sentient, and intentional) behaviour using simulations. First, we simulate the aforementioned in vitro experiments, in which neuronal cultures spontaneously learn to play Pong, by implementing nested, free energy minimising processes. The simulations are then used to deconstruct the ensuing predictive behaviour, leading to the distinction between merely reactive, sentient, and intentional behaviour, with the latter formalised in terms of inductive planning. This distinction is further studied using simple machine learning benchmarks (navigation in a grid world and the Tower of Hanoi problem), that show how quickly and efficiently adaptive behaviour emerges under an inductive form of active inference.",

      "abstract": "Topology inference for networked dynamical systems (NDSs) has received considerable attention in recent years. The majority of pioneering works have dealt with inferring the topology from abundant observations of NDSs, so as to approximate the real one asymptotically. Leveraging the characteristic that NDSs will react to various disturbances and the disturbance's influence will consistently spread, this paper focuses on inferring the topology by a few active excitations. The key challenge is to distinguish different influences of system noises and excitations from the exhibited state deviations, where the influences will decay with time and the exciatation cannot be arbitrarily large. To practice, we propose a one-shot excitation based inference method to infer $h$-hop neighbors of a node. The excitation conditions for accurate one-hop neighbor inference are first derived with probability guarantees. Then, we extend the results to $h$-hop neighbor inference and multiple excitations cases, providing the explicit relationships between the inference accuracy and excitation magnitude. Specifically, the excitation based inference method is not only suitable for scenarios where abundant observations are unavailable, but also can be leveraged as auxiliary means to improve the accuracy of existing methods. Simulations are conducted to verify the analytical results.",

Five latent profiles successfully sorts observations into interactive lecture-like, Modeling Instruction, ISLE labs, Context-Rich problems labs, and recitation/discussion-like.

The method first employs variational inference on each individual learning agent to generate a local approximate posterior, the agents transmit their local posteriors to other agents in the network, and finally each agent combines its set of received local posteriors. The key insight in this work is that, for many Bayesian models, approximate inference schemes destroy symmetry and dependencies in the model that are crucial to the correct application of Bayes' rule when combining the local posteriors. The proposed method addresses this issue by including an additional optimization step in the combination procedure that accounts for these broken dependencies. Experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate that the decentralized method provides advantages in computational performance and predictive test likelihood over previous batch and distributed methods.",

The extension of the Halpha and BrGamma line forming regions were accurately measured and compared with CMFGEN models of both stars. Moreover, clear signs of activity were observed in the differential visibility and phases.

This paper introduces two solutions that work in concert to address these limitations. First, we present a novel planning algorithm for finite temporal horizons with drastically lower computational complexity. Second, inspired by Z-learning from control theory literature, we simplify the process of setting an appropriate target distribution for new and existing active inference planning schemes. Our first approach leverages the dynamic programming algorithm, known for its computational efficiency, to minimize the cost function used in planning through the Bellman-optimality principle. Accordingly, our algorithm recursively assesses the expected free energy of actions in the reverse temporal order. This improves computational efficiency by orders of magnitude and allows precise model learning and planning, even under uncertain conditions. Our method simplifies the planning process and shows meaningful behaviour even when specifying only the agent's final goal state. The proposed solutions make defining a target distribution from a goal state straightforward compared to the more complicated task of defining a temporally informed target distribution. The effectiveness of these methods is tested and demonstrated through simulations in standard grid-world tasks. These advances create new opportunities for various applications.",

However, existing models of human collision avoidance behavior are fragmented, focusing on specific scenarios or only describing certain aspects of the avoidance behavior, such as response times. This paper addresses these gaps by proposing a novel computational cognitive model of human collision avoidance behavior based on active inference. Active inference provides a unified approach to modeling human behavior: the minimization of free energy. Building on prior active inference work, our model incorporates established cognitive mechanisms such as evidence accumulation to simulate human responses in two distinct collision avoidance scenarios: front-to-rear lead vehicle braking and lateral incursion by an oncoming vehicle. We demonstrate that our model explains a wide range of previous empirical findings on human collision avoidance behavior. Specifically, the model closely reproduces both aggregate results from meta-analyses previously reported in the literature and detailed, scenario-specific effects observed in a recent driving simulator study, including response timing, maneuver selection, and execution. Our results highlight the potential of active inference as a unified framework for understanding and modeling human behavior in complex real-life driving tasks.",

Doing this explicitly or completely prior to the actual interaction is not always possible nor sufficient. Agents also need to continuously understand the current actions of others and quickly adapt their own behavior appropriately. Here we investigate how efficient, automatic coordination processes at the level of mental states (intentions, goals), which we call belief resonance, can lead to collaborative situated problem-solving. We present a model of hierarchical active inference for collaborative agents (HAICA). It combines efficient Bayesian Theory of Mind processes with a perception-action system based on predictive processing and active inference. Belief resonance is realized by letting the inferred mental states of one agent influence another agent's predictive beliefs about its own goals and intentions. This way, the inferred mental states influence the agent's own task behavior without explicit collaborative reasoning. We implement and evaluate this model in the Overcooked domain, in which two agents with varying degrees of belief resonance team up to fulfill meal orders. Our results demonstrate that agents based on HAICA achieve a team performance comparable to recent state of the art approaches, while incurring much lower computational costs. We also show that belief resonance is especially beneficial in settings were the agents have asymmetric knowledge about the environment. The results indicate that belief resonance and active inference allow for quick and efficient agent coordination, and thus can serve as a building block for collaborative cognitive agents.",

In particular, we develop new acquisition functions for sequential design via the minimization of the posterior variance of a desired causal estimand. Our approach facilitates targeted learning of a variety of causal estimands, such as the average treatment effect (ATE), the average treatment effect on the treated (ATTE), and individualized treatment effects (ITE), and can be used for adaptive selection of an experimental unit and/or the applied treatment. We then demonstrate in a suite of numerical experiments the improved performance of ACE over baseline methods for estimating causal estimands given a limited number of experiments.",

      "abstract": "Many fields of science and engineering rely on running simulations with complex and computationally expensive models to understand the involved processes in the system of interest. Nevertheless, the high cost involved hamper reliable and exhaustive simulations. Very often such codes incorporate heuristics that ironically make them less tractable and transparent. This paper introduces an active learning methodology for adaptively constructing surrogate models, i.e. emulators, of such costly computer codes in a multi-output setting. The proposed technique is sequential and adaptive, and is based on the optimization of a suitable acquisition function. It aims to achieve accurate approximations, model tractability, as well as compact and expressive simulated datasets. In order to achieve this, the proposed Active Multi-Output Gaussian Process Emulator (AMOGAPE) combines the predictive capacity of Gaussian Processes (GPs) with the design of an acquisition function that favors sampling in low density and fluctuating regions of the approximation functions. Comparing different acquisition functions, we illustrate the promising performance of the method for the construction of emulators with toy examples, as well as for a widely used remote sensing transfer code.",

      "abstract": "Intrusion detection has focused primarily on detecting cyberattacks at the event-level. Since there is such a large volume of network data and attacks are minimal, machine learning approaches have focused on improving accuracy and reducing false positives, but this has frequently resulted in overfitting. In addition, the volume of intrusion detection alerts is large and creates fatigue in the human analyst who must review them. This research addresses the problems associated with event-level intrusion detection and the large volumes of intrusion alerts by applying active learning and cyber situation awareness. This paper includes the results of two experiments using the UNSW-NB15 dataset. The first experiment evaluated sampling approaches for querying the oracle, as part of active learning. It then trained a Random Forest classifier using the samples and evaluated its results. The second experiment applied cyber situation awareness by aggregating the detection results of the first experiment and calculating the probability that a computer system was part of a cyberattack. This research showed that moving the perspective of event-level alerts to the probability that a computer system was part of an attack improved the accuracy of detection and reduced the volume of alerts that a human analyst would need to review.",

We first provide a brief overview of active inference, and in particular, of how it applies to the modeling of decision-making, introspection, as well as the generation of overt and covert actions. We then discuss how active inference can be leveraged to design explainable AI systems, namely, by allowing us to model core features of ``introspective'' processes and by generating useful, human-interpretable models of the processes involved in decision-making. We propose an architecture for explainable AI systems using active inference. This architecture foregrounds the role of an explicit hierarchical generative model, the operation of which enables the AI system to track and explain the factors that contribute to its own decisions, and whose structure is designed to be interpretable and auditable by human users. We outline how this architecture can integrate diverse sources of information to make informed decisions in an auditable manner, mimicking or reproducing aspects of human-like consciousness and introspection. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for future research in AI, and the potential ethical considerations of developing AI systems with (the appearance of) introspective capabilities.",

This work-in-progress paper introduces a Probabilistic Active Inference Resilience Agent (PAIR-Agent) to achieve resilience in DCC systems. PAIR-Agent performs three core operations: (i) constructing a causal fault graph from device logs, (ii) identifying faults while managing certainties and uncertainties using Markov blankets and the free energy principle, and (iii) autonomously healing issues through active inference. Through continuous monitoring and adaptive reconfiguration, the agent maintains service continuity and stability under diverse failure conditions.

Our analyses are based on mock data generated using a perturbative forward model, with noise drawn from a Gaussian distribution with a constant power spectrum. This idealized setting, where the field-level likelihood is exactly Gaussian, allows us to precisely quantify the information content in the nonlinear field on large scales. We find that field-level inference accurately recovers all cosmological parameters in both real and redshift space, with uncertainties consistent with perturbation theory expectations. We show that these error bars are comparable to those obtained from a joint power spectrum and bispectrum analysis using the same perturbative model. Finally, we perform several tests using the Gaussian field-level likelihood to fit the mock data where the true noise model is non-Gaussian, and find significant biases in the inferred cosmological parameters. These results highlight that the success of field-level inference critically depends on using the correct likelihood, which may be the primary challenge for applying this method to smaller scales even in the perturbative regime.",

This kind of metadata can help discovering hidden relations and commonalities among server deployments offering new possibilities to cluster and classify them.

We propose herein an active measurement-based methodology for acquiring Transport Layer Security (TLS) metadata from servers and leverage it for their fingerprinting. Our fingerprints capture the characteristic behavior of the TLS stack primarily caused by the implementation, configuration, and hardware support of the underlying server. Using an empirical optimization strategy that maximizes information gain from every handshake to minimize measurement costs, we generated 10 general-purpose Client Hellos used as scanning probes to create a large database of TLS configurations used for classifying servers. We fingerprinted 28 million servers from the Alexa and Majestic toplists and two Command and Control (C2) blocklists over a period of 30 weeks with weekly snapshots as foundation for two long-term case studies: classification of Content Delivery Network and C2 servers. The proposed methodology shows a precision of more than 99 % and enables a stable identification of new servers over time. This study describes a new opportunity for active measurements to provide valuable insights into the Internet that can be used in security-relevant use cases.",

      "abstract": "Computer simulations have long presented the exciting possibility of scientific insight into complex real-world processes. Despite the power of modern computing, however, it remains challenging to systematically perform inference under simulation models. This has led to the rise of simulation-based inference (SBI), a class of machine learning-enabled techniques for approaching inverse problems with stochastic simulators. Many such methods, however, require large numbers of simulation samples and face difficulty scaling to high-dimensional settings, often making inference prohibitive under resource-intensive simulators. To mitigate these drawbacks, we introduce active sequential neural posterior estimation (ASNPE). ASNPE brings an active learning scheme into the inference loop to estimate the utility of simulation parameter candidates to the underlying probabilistic model. The proposed acquisition scheme is easily integrated into existing posterior estimation pipelines, allowing for improved sample efficiency with low computational overhead. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in the travel demand calibration setting, a high-dimensional inverse problem commonly requiring computationally expensive traffic simulators. Our method outperforms well-tuned benchmarks and state-of-the-art posterior estimation methods on a large-scale real-world traffic network, as well as demonstrates a performance advantage over non-active counterparts on a suite of SBI benchmark environments.",

While the nine year old Wilkinson Mass Anisotropy Probe experiment suggests the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom to be $N_{\\text{eff}} = 3.84 \\pm 0.40$, recently reported Planck collaboration results show more preference towards the standard three light neutrino scenario $ N_{\\text{eff}} = 3.30^{+0.54}_{-0.51}$. Keeping in mind that the issue of existence or non-existence of sub-eV scale sterile neutrinos is not yet settled, here we outline a mechanism to generate sub-eV scale masses for three active and one sterile neutrinos simultaneously. The model is based on an abelian extension of standard model where the fermion and scalar fields are charged under the additional $U(1)$ gauge group in such an anomaly free way that it allows one eV scale neutrino and three massless neutrinos at tree level. However, at one loop level, this model naturally allows three active and one sterile neutrino with mass at the sub-eV scale. The model also allows for mixing between active and sterile neutrinos at one loop level which can have interesting signatures in reactor neutrino experiments.",

These systems reflect a form of active matter, whereby individual material components have internal energy. Under specific parameter regimes, these active systems undergo phase transitions whereby small fluctuations of single components can lead to global changes to the rheology of the system. Simulations and methods from statistical physics are typically used to understand and predict these phase transitions for real-world observations. In this work, we demonstrate that simulation-based inference can be used to robustly infer active matter parameters from system observations. Moreover, we demonstrate that a small number (from one to three) snapshots of the system can be used for parameter inference and that this graph-informed approach outperforms typical metrics such as the average velocity or mean square displacement of the system. Our work highlights that high-level system information is contained within the relational structure of a collective system and that this can be exploited to better couple models to data.",

      "abstract": "Existing approaches to active learning maximize the system performance by sampling unlabeled instances for annotation that yield the most efficient training. However, when active learning is integrated with an end-user application, this can lead to frustration for participating users, as they spend time labeling instances that they would not otherwise be interested in reading. In this paper, we propose a new active learning approach that jointly optimizes the seemingly counteracting objectives of the active learning system (training efficiently) and the user (receiving useful instances). We study our approach in an educational application, which particularly benefits from this technique as the system needs to rapidly learn to predict the appropriateness of an exercise to a particular user, while the users should receive only exercises that match their skills. We evaluate multiple learning strategies and user types with data from real users and find that our joint approach better satisfies both objectives when alternative methods lead to many unsuitable exercises for end users.",

With an appropriate reward function to quantify the utility of acquiring a batch, such as the joint mutual information between the batch and the model parameters, BatchGFN is able to construct highly informative batches for active learning in a principled way. We show our approach enables sampling near-optimal utility batches at inference time with a single forward pass per point in the batch in toy regression problems. This alleviates the computational complexity of batch-aware algorithms and removes the need for greedy approximations to find maximizers for the batch reward.

      "abstract": "We propose an inference-time scaling approach for pretrained flow models. Recently, inference-time scaling has gained significant attention in LLMs and diffusion models, improving sample quality or better aligning outputs with user preferences by leveraging additional computation. For diffusion models, particle sampling has allowed more efficient scaling due to the stochasticity at intermediate denoising steps. On the contrary, while flow models have gained popularity as an alternative to diffusion models--offering faster generation and high-quality outputs in state-of-the-art image and video generative models--efficient inference-time scaling methods used for diffusion models cannot be directly applied due to their deterministic generative process. To enable efficient inference-time scaling for flow models, we propose three key ideas: 1) SDE-based generation, enabling particle sampling in flow models, 2) Interpolant conversion, broadening the search space and enhancing sample diversity, and 3) Rollover Budget Forcing (RBF), an adaptive allocation of computational resources across timesteps to maximize budget utilization. Our experiments show that SDE-based generation, particularly variance-preserving (VP) interpolant-based generation, improves the performance of particle sampling methods for inference-time scaling in flow models. Additionally, we demonstrate that RBF with VP-SDE achieves the best performance, outperforming all previous inference-time scaling approaches.",

Despite the successes of non-parametric inference and neural-network-based inference for empirical modelling, a physical interpretation of the results often remains challenging. Here, we focus on direct inference of governing differential equations from data, which can be formulated as a linear inverse problem. A Bayesian framework with a Laplacian prior distribution is employed for finding sparse solutions efficiently. The superior accuracy and robustness of the method is demonstrated for various cases, including ordinary, partial, and stochastic differential equations. Furthermore, we develop an active learning procedure for the automated discovery of stochastic differential equations. In this procedure, learning of the unknown dynamical equations is coupled to the application of perturbations to the measured system in a feedback loop. We demonstrate with simulations that the active learning procedure improves the inference of empirical, Langevin-type descriptions of stochastic processes.",

      "abstract": "The task of determining labels of all network nodes based on the knowledge about network structure and labels of some training subset of nodes is called the within-network classification. It may happen that none of the labels of the nodes is known and additionally there is no information about number of classes to which nodes can be assigned. In such a case a subset of nodes has to be selected for initial label acquisition. The question that arises is: \"labels of which nodes should be collected and used for learning in order to provide the best classification accuracy for the whole network?\". Active learning and inference is a practical framework to study this problem.   A set of methods for active learning and inference for within network classification is proposed and validated. The utility score calculation for each node based on network structure is the first step in the process. The scores enable to rank the nodes. Based on the ranking, a set of nodes, for which the labels are acquired, is selected (e.g. by taking top or bottom N from the ranking). The new measure-neighbour methods proposed in the paper suggest not obtaining labels of nodes from the ranking but rather acquiring labels of their neighbours. The paper examines 29 distinct formulations of utility score and selection methods reporting their impact on the results of two collective classification algorithms: Iterative Classification Algorithm and Loopy Belief Propagation.   We advocate that the accuracy of presented methods depends on the structural properties of the examined network. We claim that measure-neighbour methods will work better than the regular methods for networks with higher clustering coefficient and worse than regular methods for networks with low clustering coefficient. According to our hypothesis, based on clustering coefficient we are able to recommend appropriate active learning and inference method.",

We aim to provide $1-α$ post-hoc confidence bounds on the number of positive and negative (or non-positive) parameters. The guarantee is simultaneous, for all subsets of parameters. Our suggestion is as follows: start by using the data to select the direction of the hypothesis test for each parameter; then, adjust the $p$-values of the one-sided hypotheses for the selection, and use the adjusted $p$-values for simultaneous inference on the selected $n$ one-sided hypotheses. The adjustment is straightforward assuming that the $p$-values of one-sided hypotheses have densities with monotone likelihood ratio, and are mutually independent. We show that the bounds we provide are tighter (often by a great margin) than existing alternatives, and that they can be obtained by at most a polynomial time. We demonstrate the usefulness of our simultaneous post-hoc bounds in the evaluation of treatment effects across studies or subgroups. Specifically, we provide a tight lower bound on the number of studies which are beneficial, as well as on the number of studies which are harmful (or non-beneficial), and in addition conclude on the effect direction of individual studies, while guaranteeing that the probability of at least one wrong inference is at most 0.05.",

This entails that future networks may be better viewed as techno-social systems that resemble biological superorganisms with brain-like cognitive capabilities. Fast-forwarding, there is now growing awareness that we have to completely change our networks from being static into being a living entity that would act as an AI-powered network `brain', as recently stated by Bruno Zerbib, Chief Technology and Innovation Officer of France's Orange, at the Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2025. Even though AI was front and center at both MWC and OFC 2025 and has been widely studied in the context of optical networks, there are currently no publications on active inference in optical (and less so mobile) networks available. Active inference is an ideal methodology for developing more advanced AI systems by biomimicking the way living intelligent systems work, while overcoming the limitations of today's AI related to training, learning, and explainability. Active inference is considered the key to true AI: Less artificial, more intelligent. The goal of this paper is twofold. First, we aim at enabling optical network researchers to conceptualize new research lines for future optical networks with human-AI interaction capabilities by introducing them to the main mathematical concepts of the active inference framework. Second, we demonstrate how to move AI research beyond the human brain toward the 6G world brain by exploring the role of mycorrhizal networks, the largest living organism on planet Earth, in the AI vision and R&D roadmap for the next decade and beyond laid out by Karl Friston, the father of active inference.",

While prior post-training optimizations, such as inter- and intra-expert pruning, reduce memory usage they provide limited gains in inference-time compute efficiency. Moreover, existing MoE architectures typically activate a fixed number of experts uniformly across all layers, resulting in redundant computation and suboptimal performance. In this work, we first demonstrate that MoE pruning strategies improve only the memory footprint but do not significantly improve inference performance on GPU using optimized frameworks such as vLLM. To address this, we introduce LExI, a data-free optimization technique that determines the optimal number of active experts per layer in a pretrained MoE model. LExI leverages only the model weights to estimate the relative importance of each layer and adaptively assigns the number of active experts accordingly per layer. Experiments on state-of-the-art language and vision MoE benchmarks demonstrate that LExI significantly outperforms traditional MoE pruning approaches in terms of inference efficiency with negligible accuracy loss. For example, using LExI, Qwen1.5-MoE achieves the same throughput on Nvidia H100 GPU with 10% better accuracy than traditional expert pruning.",

The estimate of P stands in some class of probabilistic models such as probabilistic automata (PA). In this paper, we focus on probabilistic models based on multiplicity automata (MA). The stochastic languages generated by MA are called rational stochastic languages; they strictly include stochastic languages generated by PA; they also admit a very concise canonical representation. Despite the fact that this class is not recursively enumerable, it is efficiently identifiable in the limit by using the algorithm DEES, introduced by the authors in a previous paper. However, the identification is not proper and before the convergence of the algorithm, DEES can produce MA that do not define stochastic languages. Nevertheless, it is possible to use these MA to define stochastic languages. We show that they belong to a broader class of rational series, that we call pseudo-stochastic rational languages. The aim of this paper is twofold. First we provide a theoretical study of pseudo-stochastic rational languages, the languages output by DEES, showing for example that this class is decidable within polynomial time. Second, we have carried out a lot of experiments in order to compare DEES to classical inference algorithms such as ALERGIA and MDI. They show that DEES outperforms them in most cases.",

This allows us to generate natural images that simultaneously satisfy conjunctions, disjunctions, and negations of concepts. We evaluate compositional generation abilities of our model on the CelebA dataset of natural faces and synthetic 3D scene images.

However, closing the loop on robot inference requires more than just revealing the robot's current policy: the robot should also display the alternatives it thinks are likely, and prompt the human teacher when additional guidance is necessary. In this paper we propose a multimodal approach for communicating robot inference that combines both passive and active feedback. Specifically, we leverage information-rich augmented reality to passively visualize what the robot has inferred, and attention-grabbing haptic wristbands to actively prompt and direct the human's teaching. We apply our system to shared autonomy tasks where the robot must infer the human's goal in real-time. Within this context, we integrate passive and active modalities into a single algorithmic framework that determines when and which type of feedback to provide. Combining both passive and active feedback experimentally outperforms single modality baselines; during an in-person user study, we demonstrate that our integrated approach increases how efficiently humans teach the robot while simultaneously decreasing the amount of time humans spend interacting with the robot.

      "abstract": "IIt is known that a statistically significant treatment may not be clinically significant. A quantity that can be used to assess clinical significance is called the minimum clinically important difference (MCID), and inference on the MCID is an important and challenging problem. Modeling for the purpose of inference on the MCID is non-trivial, and concerns about bias from a misspecified parametric model or inefficiency from a nonparametric model motivate an alternative approach to balance robustness and efficiency. In particular, a recently proposed representation of the MCID as the minimizer of a suitable risk function makes it possible to construct a Gibbs posterior distribution for the MCID without specifying a model. We establish the posterior convergence rate and show, numerically, that an appropriately scaled version of this Gibbs posterior yields interval estimates for the MCID which are both valid and efficient even for relatively small sample sizes.",

      "abstract": "We present a method for active inference with partial observations in stochastic systems through incentive design, also known as the leader-follower game. Consider a leader agent who aims to infer a follower agent's type given a finite set of possible types. Different types of followers differ in either the dynamical model, the reward function, or both. We assume the leader can partially observe a follower's behavior in the stochastic system modeled as a Markov decision process, in which the follower takes an optimal policy to maximize a total reward. To improve inference accuracy and efficiency, the leader can offer side payments (incentives) to the followers such that different types of them, under the incentive design, can exhibit diverging behaviors that facilitate the leader's inference task. We show the problem of active inference through incentive design can be formulated as a special class of leader-follower games, where the leader's objective is to balance the information gain and cost of incentive design. The information gain is measured by the entropy of the estimated follower's type given partial observations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this problem can be solved by reducing a single-level optimization through softmax temporal consistency between followers' policies and value functions. This reduction allows us to develop an efficient gradient-based algorithm. We utilize observable operators in the hidden Markov model (HMM) to compute the necessary gradients and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments in stochastic grid world environments.",

We resolve this dilemma through posterior coupling via entropic tilting. Our framework constructs independent posteriors for propensity score and outcome models, then couples them using entropic tilting to enforce the DR moment condition. This yields the first fully Bayesian DR estimator with an explicit posterior distribution. Theoretically, we establish three key properties: (i) when the outcome model is correctly specified, the tilted posterior coincides with the original; (ii) under propensity score model correctness, the posterior mean remains consistent despite outcome model misspecification; (iii) convergence rates improve for nonparametric outcome models. Simulations demonstrate superior bias reduction and efficiency compared to existing methods. We illustrate practical advantages of the proposed method through two applications: sensitivity analysis for unmeasured confounding in antihypertensive treatment effects on dementia, and high-dimensional confounder selection combining shrinkage priors with modified moment conditions for right heart catheterization mortality.

      "abstract": "Cluster inference based on spatial extent thresholding is the most popular analysis method for finding activated brain areas in neuroimaging. However, the method has several well-known issues. While powerful for finding brain regions with some activation, the method as currently defined does not allow any further quantification or localization of signal. In this paper we repair this gap. We show that cluster-extent inference can be used (1.) to infer the presence of signal in anatomical regions of interest and (2.) to quantify the percentage of active voxels in any cluster or region of interest. These additional inferences come for free, i.e. they do not require any further adjustment of the alpha-level of tests, while retaining full familywise error control. We achieve this extension of the possibilities of cluster inference by an embedding of the method into a closed testing procedure, and solving the graph-theoretic k-separator problem that results from this embedding. The new method can be used in combination with random field theory or permutations. We demonstrate the usefulness of the method in a large-scale application to neuroimaging data from the Neurovault database.",

This assumption is violated in settings where units are related through a network of dependencies. An example of such a setting is ad placement in sponsored search advertising, where the clickability of a particular ad is potentially influenced by where it is placed and where other ads are placed on the search result page. In such scenarios, confounding arises due to not only the individual ad-level covariates but also the placements and covariates of other ads in the system. In this paper, we leverage the language of causal inference in the presence of interference to model interactions among the ads. Quantification of such interactions allows us to better understand the click behavior of users, which in turn impacts the revenue of the host search engine and enhances user satisfaction. We illustrate the utility of our formalization through experiments carried out on the ad placement system of the Bing search engine.",

We present an active inference body perception and action model working for the first time in a humanoid robot. The model relies on the free energy principle proposed for the brain, where both perception and action goal is to minimise the prediction error through gradient descent on the variational free energy bound. The body state (latent variable) is inferred by minimising the difference between the observed (visual and proprioceptive) sensor values and the predicted ones. Simultaneously, the action makes sensory data sampling to better correspond to the prediction made by the inner model. We formalised and implemented the algorithm on the iCub robot and tested in 2D and 3D visual spaces for online adaptation to visual changes, sensory noise and discrepancies between the model and the real robot. We also compared our approach with classical inverse kinematics in a reaching task, analysing the suitability of such a neuroscience-inspired approach for real-world interaction. The algorithm gave the robot adaptive body perception and upper body reaching with head object tracking (toddler-like), and was able to incorporate visual features online (in a closed-loop manner) without increasing the computational complexity. Moreover, our model predicted involuntary actions in the presence of sensorimotor conflicts showing the path for a potential proof of active inference in humans.",

Here, we assess the quality of these empirical models by comparing their output predictions with trajectories of rod-shaped active particles that scatter sterically at a flat wall. We employ a classical least-squares method to evaluate the instantaneous torque. In addition, we lay out a Bayesian inference procedure to construct the posterior distribution of plausible model parameters.

      "abstract": "Standard cosmic microwave background (CMB) analyses constrain cosmological and astrophysical parameters by fitting parametric models to multifrequency power spectra (MFPS). However, such methods do not optimally weight maps in power spectrum (PS) measurements for non-Gaussian CMB foregrounds. We propose needlet internal linear combination (NILC), operating on wavelets with compact support in pixel and harmonic space, as a weighting scheme to yield more optimal parameter constraints. In a companion paper, we derived an analytic formula for NILC map PS, which is physically insightful but computationally difficult to use in parameter inference pipelines. In this work, we analytically show that fitting parametric templates to MFPS and harmonic ILC PS yields identical parameter constraints when the number of sky components equals or exceeds the number of frequency channels. We numerically show that, for Gaussian random fields, the same holds for NILC PS. This suggests that NILC can reduce parameter error bars in the presence of non-Gaussian fields since it uses non-Gaussian information. As Gaussian likelihoods may be inaccurate, we use likelihood-free inference (LFI) with neural posterior estimation. We show that performing inference with auto- and cross-PS of NILC component maps as summary statistics yields smaller parameter error bars than inference with MFPS. For a model with CMB, an amplified thermal Sunyaev--Zel'dovich (tSZ) signal, and noise, we find a 60% reduction in the area of the 2D 68% confidence region for component amplitude parameters inferred from NILC PS, as compared to inference from MFPS. Primordial $B$-mode searches are a promising application for our new method, as the amplitude of the non-Gaussian dust foreground is known to be larger than a potential signal.

Specifically, we consider delays in the visuo-oculomotor loop and their implications for active inference. Active inference uses a generalisation of Kalman filtering to provide Bayes optimal estimates of hidden states and action in generalized coordinates of motion. Representing hidden states in generalized coordinates provides a simple way of compensating for both sensory and oculomotor delays. The efficacy of this scheme is illustrated using neuronal simulations of pursuit initiation responses, with and without compensation. We then consider an extension of the gener-ative model to simulate smooth pursuit eye movements - in which the visuo-oculomotor system believes both the target and its centre of gaze are attracted to a (hidden) point moving in the visual field. Finally, the generative model is equipped with a hierarchical structure, so that it can recognise and remember unseen (occluded) trajectories and emit anticipatory responses. These simulations speak to a straightforward and neurobiologically plausible solution to the generic problem of integrating information from different sources with different temporal delays and the particular difficulties encountered when a system - like the oculomotor system - tries to control its environment with delayed signals.",

Reinforcement learning methods have achieved great success by creating agents that optimize engineered reward functions, but which often struggle to learn in sparse-reward environments, generally require many environmental interactions to perform well, and are typically computationally very expensive. Active inference is a model-based approach that directs agents to explore uncertain states while adhering to a prior model of their goal behaviour. This paper introduces an active inference agent which minimizes the novel free energy of the expected future. Our model is capable of solving sparse-reward problems with a very high sample efficiency due to its objective function, which encourages directed exploration of uncertain states. Moreover, our model is computationally very light and can operate in a fully online manner while achieving comparable performance to offline RL methods. We showcase the capabilities of our model by solving the mountain car problem, where we demonstrate its superior exploration properties and its robustness to observation noise, which in fact improves performance. We also introduce a novel method for approximating the prior model from the reward function, which simplifies the expression of complex objectives and improves performance over previous active inference approaches.",

      "abstract": "Given the surge in wireless data traffic driven by the emerging Internet of Things (IoT), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), cognitive radio (CR), and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) have been recognized as promising techniques to overcome massive connectivity issues. As a result, there is an increasing need to intelligently improve the channel capacity of future wireless networks. Motivated by active inference from cognitive neuroscience, this paper investigates joint subchannel and power allocation for an uplink UAV-assisted cognitive NOMA network. Maximizing the sum rate is often a highly challenging optimization problem due to dynamic network conditions and power constraints. To address this challenge, we propose an active inference-based algorithm. We transform the sum rate maximization problem into abnormality minimization by utilizing a generalized state-space model to characterize the time-changing network environment. The problem is then solved using an Active Generalized Dynamic Bayesian Network (Active-GDBN). The proposed framework consists of an offline perception stage, in which a UAV employs a hierarchical GDBN structure to learn an optimal generative model of discrete subchannels and continuous power allocation. In the online active inference stage, the UAV dynamically selects discrete subchannels and continuous power to maximize the sum rate of secondary users. By leveraging the errors in each episode, the UAV can adapt its resource allocation policies and belief updating to improve its performance over time. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in terms of cumulative sum rate compared to benchmark schemes.",

      "abstract": "Suspensions of spherical active particles often show microphase separation. At a continuum level, coupling their scalar density to fluid flow, there are two distinct explanations. Each involves an effective interfacial tension: the first mechanical (causing flow) and the second diffusive (causing Ostwald ripening). Here we show how the negative mechanical tension of contractile swimmers creates, via a self-shearing instability, a steady-state life cycle of droplet growth interrupted by division whose scaling behavior we predict. When the diffusive tension is also negative, this is replaced by an arrested regime (mechanistically distinct, but with similar scaling) where division of small droplets is prevented by reverse Ostwald ripening.",

      "abstract": "This work studies how brain-inspired neural ensembles equipped with local Hebbian plasticity can perform active inference (AIF) in order to control dynamical agents. A generative model capturing the environment dynamics is learned by a network composed of two distinct Hebbian ensembles: a posterior network, which infers latent states given the observations, and a state transition network, which predicts the next expected latent state given current state-action pairs. Experimental studies are conducted using the Mountain Car environment from the OpenAI gym suite, to study the effect of the various Hebbian network parameters on the task performance. It is shown that the proposed Hebbian AIF approach outperforms the use of Q-learning, while not requiring any replay buffer, as in typical reinforcement learning systems. These results motivate further investigations of Hebbian learning for the design of AIF networks that can learn environment dynamics without the need for revisiting past buffered experiences.",

This set is guaranteed to contain a correct answer with high probability, and is well-suited for many open-ended classification tasks. In the standard CP paradigm, the predicted set can often be unusably large and also costly to obtain. This is particularly pervasive in settings where the correct answer is not unique, and the number of total possible answers is high. We first expand the CP correctness criterion to allow for additional, inferred \"admissible\" answers, which can substantially reduce the size of the predicted set while still providing valid performance guarantees. Second, we amortize costs by conformalizing prediction cascades, in which we aggressively prune implausible labels early on by using progressively stronger classifiers -- again, while still providing valid performance guarantees. We demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of our approach for multiple applications in natural language processing and computational chemistry for drug discovery.",

Traditional approaches to mitigate this issue often introduce more complex and less hardware-friendly activation functions. In this work, we propose a Hysteresis Rectified Linear Unit (HeLU), an efficient activation function designed to address the ``dying ReLU'' problem with minimal complexity. Unlike traditional activation functions with fixed thresholds for training and inference, HeLU employs a variable threshold that refines the backpropagation. This refined mechanism allows simpler activation functions to achieve competitive performance comparable to their more complex counterparts without introducing unnecessary complexity or requiring inductive biases. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that HeLU enhances model generalization across diverse datasets, offering a promising solution for efficient and effective inference suitable for a wide range of neural network architectures.",

      "abstract": "Flexible, goal-directed behavior is a fundamental aspect of human life. Based on the free energy minimization principle, the theory of active inference formalizes the generation of such behavior from a computational neuroscience perspective. Based on the theory, we introduce an output-probabilistic, temporally predictive, modular artificial neural network architecture, which processes sensorimotor information, infers behavior-relevant aspects of its world, and invokes highly flexible, goal-directed behavior. We show that our architecture, which is trained end-to-end to minimize an approximation of free energy, develops latent states that can be interpreted as affordance maps. That is, the emerging latent states signal which actions lead to which effects dependent on the local context. In combination with active inference, we show that flexible, goal-directed behavior can be invoked, incorporating the emerging affordance maps. As a result, our simulated agent flexibly steers through continuous spaces, avoids collisions with obstacles, and prefers pathways that lead to the goal with high certainty. Additionally, we show that the learned agent is highly suitable for zero-shot generalization across environments: After training the agent in a handful of fixed environments with obstacles and other terrains affecting its behavior, it performs similarly well in procedurally generated environments containing different amounts of obstacles and terrains of various sizes at different locations.",

      "abstract": "A principled approach to characterize the hidden structure of networks is to formulate generative models, and then infer their parameters from data. When the desired structure is composed of modules or \"communities\", a suitable choice for this task is the stochastic block model (SBM), where nodes are divided into groups, and the placement of edges is conditioned on the group memberships. Here, we present a nonparametric Bayesian method to infer the modular structure of empirical networks, including the number of modules and their hierarchical organization. We focus on a microcanonical variant of the SBM, where the structure is imposed via hard constraints, i.e. the generated networks are not allowed to violate the patterns imposed by the model. We show how this simple model variation allows simultaneously for two important improvements over more traditional inference approaches: 1. Deeper Bayesian hierarchies, with noninformative priors replaced by sequences of priors and hyperpriors, that not only remove limitations that seriously degrade the inference on large networks, but also reveal structures at multiple scales; 2. A very efficient inference algorithm that scales well not only for networks with a large number of nodes and edges, but also with an unlimited number of modules. We show also how this approach can be used to sample modular hierarchies from the posterior distribution, as well as to perform model selection. We discuss and analyze the differences between sampling from the posterior and simply finding the single parameter estimate that maximizes it. Furthermore, we expose a direct equivalence between our microcanonical approach and alternative derivations based on the canonical SBM.",

      "abstract": "Recent large language models (LLMs) with enormous model sizes use many GPUs to meet memory capacity requirements incurring substantial costs for token generation. To provide cost-effective LLM inference with relaxed latency constraints, extensive research has focused on expanding GPU memory by leveraging the host memory. However, LLM inference engines that utilize the host memory often face underutilization of GPU compute units, as a considerable portion of inference time is spent in loading the model onto the GPU via host-GPU interconnect. To tackle these challenges of the host memory offloading for LLM, we introduce HybridServe, an LLM inference system with activation checkpointing based on activation caching. The activation cache stores activation checkpoints generated during intermediate inference stages, allowing the fast recomputation of KV cache while model parameters are transferred to GPU from host memory. Unlike conventional methods that recompute the KV cache from scratch using token IDs, the activation cache allows bypassing projection and FFN operations. To balance between the activation recomputation and parameter loading overhead, this study proposes a KV-activation hybrid caching scheme which finds the best ratio of the key-value and activation caches to adjust the recomputation time. Our system achieves 2.19x throughput improvement over the state-of-the-art prior work for offloading both model weights and KV cache.",

The proposed regularized estimator has three important properties: (i) it has a uniform asymptotic Gaussian limit in the presence of flat faces in the absence of redundant (or overidentifying) constraints (or vice versa); (ii) the bias from regularization does not enter the first-order limiting distribution; (iii) the estimator remains consistent for sharp (non-enlarged) identified set for the individual components even in the non-regualar case. These properties are used to construct \\emph{uniformly valid} confidence sets for an element $θ_{1}$ of a parameter vector $θ\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d}$ that is partially identified by affine moment equality and inequality conditions. The proposed confidence sets can be computed as a solution to a small number of linear and convex quadratic programs, leading to a substantial decrease in computation time and guarantees a global optimum. As a result, the method provides a uniformly valid inference in applications in which the dimension of the parameter space, $d$, and the number of inequalities, $k$, were previously computationally unfeasible ($d,k=100$). The proposed approach can be extended to construct confidence sets for intersection bounds, to construct joint polygon-shaped confidence sets for multiple components of $θ$, and to find the set of solutions to a linear program. Inference for coefficients in the linear IV regression model with an interval outcome is used as an illustrative example.",

      "abstract": "We present empirical relations for determining the amount by which the effective temperatures and radii -- and therefore the estimated masses -- of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs are altered due to chromospheric activity. We base our relations on a large set of low-mass stars in the field with Halpha activity measurements, and on a set of low-mass eclipsing binaries with X-ray activity measurements from which we indirectly infer the Halpha activity. Both samples yield consistent relations linking the amount by which an active object's temperature is suppressed, and its radius inflated, to the strength of its Halpha emission. These relations are found to approximately preserve bolometric luminosity. We apply these relations to the peculiar brown-dwarf eclipsing binary 2M0535-05, in which the active, higher-mass brown dwarf has a cooler temperature than its inactive, lower-mass companion. The relations correctly reproduce the observed temperatures and radii of 2M0535-05 after accounting for the Halpha emission; 2M0535-05 would be in precise agreement with theoretical isochrones were it inactive. The relations that we present are applicable to brown dwarfs and low-mass stars with masses below 0.8 Msun and for which the activity, as measured by the fractional Halpha luminosity, is in the range -4.6 < log LHa/Lbol < -3.3. We expect these relations to be most useful for correcting radius and mass estimates of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs over their active lifetimes (few Gyr) and when the ages or distances (and therefore luminosities) are unknown. We also discuss the implications of this work for improved determinations of young cluster initial mass functions.",

      "abstract": "Collective behavior pervades biological systems, from flocks of birds to neural assemblies and human societies. Yet, how such collectives acquire functional properties -- such as joint agency or knowledge -- that transcend those of their individual components remains an open question. Here, we combine active inference and information-theoretic analyses to explore how a minimal system of interacting agents can give rise to joint agency and collective knowledge. We model flocking dynamics using multiple active inference agents, each minimizing its own free energy while coupling reciprocally with its neighbors. We show that as agents self-organize, their interactions define higher-order statistical boundaries (Markov blankets) enclosing a ``flock'' that can be treated as an emergent agent with its own sensory, active, and internal states. When exposed to external perturbations (a ``predator''), the flock exhibits faster, coordinated responses than individual agents, reflecting collective sensitivity to environmental change. Crucially, analyses of synergistic information reveal that the flock encodes information about the predator's location that is not accessible to every individual bird, demonstrating implicit collective knowledge. Together, these results show how informational coupling among active inference agents can generate new levels of autonomy and inference, providing a framework for understanding the emergence of (implicit) collective knowledge and joint agency.",

      "abstract": "With the rise of short video platforms in global communication, embedding steganographic data in audio synchronization streams has emerged as a new covert communication method. To address the limitations of traditional techniques in detecting synchronized steganography, this paper proposes a detection and distributed guidance reconstruction model based on short video \"Yupan\" samples released by China's South Sea Fleet on TikTok. The method integrates sliding spectrum feature extraction and intelligent inference mechanisms. A 25 ms sliding window with short-time Fourier transform (STFT) is used to extract the main frequency trajectory and construct the synchronization frame detection model (M1), identifying a frame flag \"FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF80\". The subsequent 32-byte payload is decoded by a structured model (M2) to infer distributed guidance commands. Analysis reveals a low-entropy, repetitive byte sequence in the 36 to 45 second audio segment with highly concentrated spectral energy, confirming the presence of synchronization frames. Although plaintext semantics are not restored, the consistency in command field layout suggests features of military communication protocols. The multi-segment splicing model further shows cross-video embedding and centralized decoding capabilities. The proposed framework validates the effectiveness of sliding spectral features for synchronized steganography detection and builds an extensible inference model for covert communication analysis and tactical guidance simulation on open platforms.",

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs), while demonstrating remarkable capabilities across various applications, present significant challenges during inference due to their substantial model size, especially when deployed on edge devices. Activation sparsity offers a promising solution to reduce computation and memory movement, enabling more efficient inference, particularly for small-batch on-device applications. However, current approaches face limitations with non-ReLU activation function, which are foundational to most advanced LLMs, or require heavy continual training. Additionally, the difficulty in predicting active channels and limited achievable sparsity ratios constrain the effectiveness of activation sparsity-based methods. In this paper, we introduce R-Sparse, a training-free activation sparsity approach capable of achieving high sparsity levels in advanced LLMs. We conducted two preliminary investigations into how different components contribute to the output within a single linear layer and found two key observations: (i) the non-sparse components of the input function can be regarded as a few bias terms, and (ii) The full computation can be effectively approximated by an appropriate combination of input channels and weight singular values. Building on this, we replace the linear layers in LLMs with a rank-aware sparse inference method that leverages the sparsity of input channels and singular value components, eliminating the need for active channel prediction like the output sparsity based approaches. Experiments on Llama-2/3 and Mistral models across ten diverse tasks demonstrate that R-Sparse achieves comparable performance at 50% model-level sparsity, resulting in a significant 43% end-to-end efficient improvements with customized kernels.",

      "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel approach to creating adaptive language agents by integrating active inference with large language models (LLMs). While LLMs demonstrate remarkable capabilities, their reliance on static prompts limits adaptation to new information and changing environments. We address this by implementing an active inference framework that acts as a cognitive layer above an LLM-based agent, dynamically adjusting prompts and search strategies through principled information-seeking behavior. Our framework models the environment using three state factors (prompt, search, and information states) with seven observation modalities capturing quality metrics. By framing the agent's learning through the free energy principle, we enable systematic exploration of prompt combinations and search strategies. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, with the agent developing accurate models of environment dynamics evidenced by emergent structure in observation matrices. Action selection patterns reveal sophisticated exploration-exploitation behavior, transitioning from initial information-gathering to targeted prompt testing. The integration of thermodynamic principles with language model capabilities provides a principled framework for creating robust, adaptable agents, extending active inference beyond traditional low-dimensional control problems to high-dimensional, language-driven environments.",

We consider a model's structure specification consistent with active inference, a theory of human perception and behavior from cognitive science. According to active inference, the agent acts upon the world so as to minimize surprise defined as a measure of the extent to which an agent's current sensory observations differ from its preferred sensory observations. We propose a bi-level optimization approach to estimation which relies on a structural assumption on prior distributions that parameterize the statistical accuracy of the human agent's model of the environment. To illustrate the proposed methodology, we present the estimation of a model for car-following behavior based upon a naturalistic dataset. Overall, the results indicate that learning active inference models of human perception and control from data is a promising alternative to black-box models of driving.",

However, out of the box, these models are not efficient at extracting preferences: the questions they generate are not informative, requiring a high number of user interactions and impeding the usability of the downstream system. In this work, we introduce an inference-time algorithm that helps LLMs quickly infer preferences by using more informative questions. Our algorithm uses a probabilistic model whose conditional distributions are defined by prompting an LLM, and returns questions that optimize expected entropy and expected model change. Results in a simplified interactive web shopping setting with real product items show that an LLM equipped with our entropy reduction algorithm outperforms baselines with the same underlying LLM on task performance while using fewer user interactions.",

      "abstract": "An experimental unit is an opportunity to randomly apply or withhold a treatment. There is interference between units if the application of the treatment to one unit may also affect other units. In cognitive neuroscience, a common form of experiment presents a sequence of stimuli or requests for cognitive activity at random to each experimental subject and measures biological aspects of brain activity that follow these requests. Each subject is then many experimental units, and interference between units within an experimental subject is likely, in part because the stimuli follow one another quickly and in part because human subjects learn or become experienced or primed or bored as the experiment proceeds. We use a recent fMRI experiment concerned with the inhibition of motor activity to illustrate and further develop recently proposed methodology for inference in the presence of interference. A simulation evaluates the power of competing procedures.",

      "abstract": "In autonomous robotic decision-making under uncertainty, the tradeoff between exploitation and exploration of available options must be considered. If secondary information associated with options can be utilized, such decision-making problems can often be formulated as contextual multi-armed bandits (CMABs). In this study, we apply active inference, which has been actively studied in the field of neuroscience in recent years, as an alternative action selection strategy for CMABs. Unlike conventional action selection strategies, it is possible to rigorously evaluate the uncertainty of each option when calculating the expected free energy (EFE) associated with the decision agent's probabilistic model, as derived from the free-energy principle. We specifically address the case where a categorical observation likelihood function is used, such that EFE values are analytically intractable. We introduce new approximation methods for computing the EFE based on variational and Laplace approximations. Extensive simulation study results demonstrate that, compared to other strategies, active inference generally requires far fewer iterations to identify optimal options and generally achieves superior cumulative regret, for relatively low extra computational cost.",

It specifies neuronal dynamics for state-estimation in terms of a descent on (variational) free energy -- a measure of the fit between an internal (generative) model and sensory observations. The free energy gradient is a prediction error -- plausibly encoded in the average membrane potentials of neuronal populations. Conversely, the expected probability of a state can be expressed in terms of neuronal firing rates. We show that this is consistent with current models of neuronal dynamics and establish face validity by synthesising plausible electrophysiological responses. We then show that these neuronal dynamics approximate natural gradient descent, a well-known optimisation algorithm from information geometry that follows the steepest descent of the objective in information space. We compare the information length of belief updating in both schemes, a measure of the distance traveled in information space that has a direct interpretation in terms of metabolic cost. We show that neural dynamics under active inference are metabolically efficient and suggest that neural representations in biological agents may evolve by approximating steepest descent in information space towards the point of optimal inference.",

      "abstract": "Classical cluster inference is hampered by the spatial specificity paradox. Given the null-hypothesis of no active voxels, the alternative hypothesis states that there is at least one active voxel in a cluster. Hence, the larger the cluster the less we know about where activation in the cluster is. Rosenblatt et al. (2018) proposed a post-hoc inference method, All-resolutions Inference (ARI), that addresses this paradox by estimating the number of active voxels of any brain region. ARI allows users to choose arbitrary brain regions and returns a simultaneous lower confidence bound of the true discovery proportion (TDP) for each of them, retaining control of the family-wise error rate. ARI does not, however, guide users to regions with high enough TDP. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm that outputs all maximal supra-threshold clusters, for which ARI gives a TDP lower confidence bound that is at least a chosen threshold, for any number of thresholds that need not be chosen a priori nor all at once. After a preprocessing step in linearithmic time, the algorithm only takes linear time in the size of its output. We demonstrate the algorithm with an application to two fMRI datasets. For both datasets, we found several clusters whose TDP confidently meets or exceeds a given threshold in less than a second.",

The training examples are initially unlabeled and we obtain the label of the most informative ones, which maximally reduces uncertainty in the LLM prediction. We propose two algorithms, GO and SAL, which differ in how the few-shot examples are chosen. We analyze these algorithms in linear models: first GO and then use its equivalence with SAL.

      "abstract": "Machine learning algorithms, when applied to sensitive data, pose a potential threat to privacy. A growing body of prior work has demonstrated that membership inference attack (MIA) can disclose specific private information in the training data to an attacker. Meanwhile, the algorithmic fairness of machine learning has increasingly caught attention from both academia and industry. Algorithmic fairness ensures that the machine learning models do not discriminate a particular demographic group of individuals (e.g., black and female people). Given that MIA is indeed a learning model, it raises a serious concern if MIA ``fairly'' treats all groups of individuals equally. In other words, whether a particular group is more vulnerable against MIA than the other groups. This paper examines the algorithmic fairness issue in the context of MIA and its defenses. First, for fairness evaluation, it formalizes the notation of vulnerability disparity (VD) to quantify the difference of MIA treatment on different demographic groups. Second, it evaluates VD on four real-world datasets, and shows that VD indeed exists in these datasets. Third, it examines the impacts of differential privacy, as a defense mechanism of MIA, on VD. The results show that although DP brings significant change on VD, it cannot eliminate VD completely. Therefore, fourth, it designs a new mitigation algorithm named FAIRPICK to reduce VD. An extensive set of experimental results demonstrate that FAIRPICK can effectively reduce VD for both with and without the DP deployment.",

We study the case where probability distributions are not known a priori but need to be estimated from data. These estimated distributions lead to empirical Gateaux derivatives, and we study the relationships between empirical, numerical, and analytical Gateaux derivatives. Starting with a case study of the interventional mean (average potential outcome), we delineate the relationship between finite differences and the analytical Gateaux derivative. We then derive requirements on the rates of numerical approximation in perturbation and smoothing that preserve the statistical benefits of one-step adjustments, such as rate double robustness. We then study more complicated functionals such as dynamic treatment regimes, the linear-programming formulation for policy optimization in infinite-horizon Markov decision processes, and sensitivity analysis in causal inference. More broadly, we study optimization-based estimators, since this begets a class of estimands where identification via regression adjustment is straightforward but obtaining influence functions under minor variations thereof is not. The ability to approximate bias adjustments in the presence of arbitrary constraints illustrates the usefulness of constructive approaches for Gateaux derivatives. We also find that the statistical structure of the functional (rate double robustness) can permit less conservative rates for finite-difference approximation. This property, however, can be specific to particular functionals; e.g., it occurs for the average potential outcome (hence average treatment effect) but not the infinite-horizon MDP policy value.",

Our key intuition is that network coding introduces topology-dependent correlation in the observations at the receivers, which can be exploited to infer the topology. For undirected tree topologies, we design hierarchical clustering algorithms, building on our prior work. For directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), first we decompose the topology into a number of two-source, two-receiver (2-by-2) subnetwork components and then we merge these components to reconstruct the topology. Our approach for DAGs builds on prior work on tomography, and improves upon it by employing network coding to accurately distinguish among all different 2-by-2 components. We evaluate our algorithms through simulation of a number of realistic topologies and compare them to active tomographic techniques without network coding. We also make connections between our approach and alternatives, including passive inference, traceroute, and packet marking.",

This work builds on operator inference from scientific machine learning to infer low-dimensional models from high-dimensional state trajectories polluted with noise. The presented analysis shows that, under certain conditions, the inferred operators are unbiased estimators of the well-studied projection-based reduced operators from traditional model reduction. Furthermore, the connection between operator inference and projection-based model reduction enables bounding the mean-squared errors of predictions made with the learned models with respect to traditional reduced models. The analysis also motivates an active operator inference approach that judiciously samples high-dimensional trajectories with the aim of achieving a low mean-squared error by reducing the effect of noise. Numerical experiments with high-dimensional linear and nonlinear state dynamics demonstrate that predictions obtained with active operator inference have orders of magnitude lower mean-squared errors than operator inference with traditional, equidistantly sampled trajectory data.",

While informative, these statistics are neither designed nor guaranteed to be statistically sufficient. With the rise of deep learning, it becomes possible to create summary statistics optimized to extract the full data information. We compare different neural summarization strategies proposed in the weak lensing literature, to assess which loss functions lead to theoretically optimal summary statistics to perform full-field inference. In doing so, we aim to provide guidelines and insights to the community to help guide future neural-based inference analyses. We design an experimental setup to isolate the impact of the loss function used to train neural networks. We have developed the sbi_lens JAX package, which implements an automatically differentiable lognormal wCDM LSST-Y10 weak lensing simulator. The explicit full-field posterior obtained using the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler gives us a ground truth to which to compare different compression strategies. We provide theoretical insight into the loss functions used in the literature and show that some do not necessarily lead to sufficient statistics (e.g. Mean Square Error (MSE)), while those motivated by information theory (e.g. Variational Mutual Information Maximization (VMIM)) can. Our numerical experiments confirm these insights and show, in our simulated wCDM scenario, that the Figure of Merit (FoM) of an analysis using neural summaries optimized under VMIM achieves 100% of the reference Omega_c - sigma_8 full-field FoM, while an analysis using neural summaries trained under MSE achieves only 81% of the same reference FoM.",

      "abstract": "We introduce NIFTY, \"Numerical Information Field Theory\", a software package for the development of Bayesian signal inference algorithms that operate independently from any underlying spatial grid and its resolution. A large number of Bayesian and Maximum Entropy methods for 1D signal reconstruction, 2D imaging, as well as 3D tomography, appear formally similar, but one often finds individualized implementations that are neither flexible nor easily transferable. Signal inference in the framework of NIFTY can be done in an abstract way, such that algorithms, prototyped in 1D, can be applied to real world problems in higher-dimensional settings. NIFTY as a versatile library is applicable and already has been applied in 1D, 2D, 3D and spherical settings. A recent application is the D3PO algorithm targeting the non-trivial task of denoising, deconvolving, and decomposing photon observations in high energy astronomy.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we address the anomaly detection problem where the objective is to find the anomalous processes among a given set of processes. To this end, the decision-making agent probes a subset of processes at every time instant and obtains a potentially erroneous estimate of the binary variable which indicates whether or not the corresponding process is anomalous. The agent continues to probe the processes until it obtains a sufficient number of measurements to reliably identify the anomalous processes. In this context, we develop a sequential selection algorithm that decides which processes to be probed at every instant to detect the anomalies with an accuracy exceeding a desired value while minimizing the delay in making the decision and the total number of measurements taken. Our algorithm is based on active inference which is a general framework to make sequential decisions in order to maximize the notion of free energy. We define the free energy using the objectives of the selection policy and implement the active inference framework using a deep neural network approximation. Using numerical experiments, we compare our algorithm with the state-of-the-art method based on deep actor-critic reinforcement learning and demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithm.",

We establish a unified theoretical framework under which the consistency of the moment estimator holds as the size of networks goes to infinity. We also derive the asymptotic representation of the moment estimator that can be used to characterize its limiting distribution.

      "abstract": "When studying unconstrained behaviour and allowing mice to leave their cage to navigate a complex labyrinth, the mice exhibit foraging behaviour in the labyrinth searching for rewards, returning to their home cage now and then, e.g. to drink. Surprisingly, when executing such a ``home run'', the mice do not follow the exact reverse path, in fact, the entry path and home path have very little overlap. Recent work proposed a hierarchical active inference model for navigation, where the low level model makes inferences about hidden states and poses that explain sensory inputs, whereas the high level model makes inferences about moving between locations, effectively building a map of the environment. However, using this ``map'' for planning, only allows the agent to find trajectories that it previously explored, far from the observed mice's behaviour. In this paper, we explore ways of incorporating before-unvisited paths in the planning algorithm, by using the low level generative model to imagine potential, yet undiscovered paths. We demonstrate a proof of concept in a grid-world environment, showing how an agent can accurately predict a new, shorter path in the map leading to its starting point, using a generative model learnt from pixel-based observations.",

      "abstract": "Crowd-sourcing has become a popular means of acquiring labeled data for a wide variety of tasks where humans are more accurate than computers, e.g., labeling images, matching objects, or analyzing sentiment. However, relying solely on the crowd is often impractical even for data sets with thousands of items, due to time and cost constraints of acquiring human input (which cost pennies and minutes per label). In this paper, we propose algorithms for integrating machine learning into crowd-sourced databases, with the goal of allowing crowd-sourcing applications to scale, i.e., to handle larger datasets at lower costs. The key observation is that, in many of the above tasks, humans and machine learning algorithms can be complementary, as humans are often more accurate but slow and expensive, while algorithms are usually less accurate, but faster and cheaper.   Based on this observation, we present two new active learning algorithms to combine humans and algorithms together in a crowd-sourced database. Our algorithms are based on the theory of non-parametric bootstrap, which makes our results applicable to a broad class of machine learning models. Our results, on three real-life datasets collected with Amazon's Mechanical Turk, and on 15 well-known UCI data sets, show that our methods on average ask humans to label one to two orders of magnitude fewer items to achieve the same accuracy as a baseline that labels random images, and two to eight times fewer questions than previous active learning schemes.",

We present a novel approach to multi-agent cooperation by implementing ToM within active inference. Unlike previous active inference approaches to multi-agent cooperation, our method neither relies on task-specific shared generative models nor requires explicit communication. In our framework, ToM-equipped agents maintain distinct representations of their own and others' beliefs and goals. ToM agents then use an extended and adapted version of the sophisticated inference tree-based planning algorithm to systematically explore joint policy spaces through recursive reasoning. We evaluate our approach through collision avoidance and foraging simulations. Results suggest that ToM agents cooperate better compared to non-ToM counterparts by being able to avoid collisions and reduce redundant efforts. Crucially, ToM agents accomplish this by inferring others' beliefs solely from observable behaviour and considering them when planning their own actions. Our approach shows potential for generalisable and scalable multi-agent systems while providing computational insights into ToM mechanisms.",

We design white-box inference attacks to perform a comprehensive privacy analysis of deep learning models. We measure the privacy leakage through parameters of fully trained models as well as the parameter updates of models during training. We design inference algorithms for both centralized and federated learning, with respect to passive and active inference attackers, and assuming different adversary prior knowledge.   We evaluate our novel white-box membership inference attacks against deep learning algorithms to trace their training data records. We show that a straightforward extension of the known black-box attacks to the white-box setting (through analyzing the outputs of activation functions) is ineffective. We therefore design new algorithms tailored to the white-box setting by exploiting the privacy vulnerabilities of the stochastic gradient descent algorithm, which is the algorithm used to train deep neural networks. We investigate the reasons why deep learning models may leak information about their training data. We then show that even well-generalized models are significantly susceptible to white-box membership inference attacks, by analyzing state-of-the-art pre-trained and publicly available models for the CIFAR dataset. We also show how adversarial participants, in the federated learning setting, can successfully run active membership inference attacks against other participants, even when the global model achieves high prediction accuracies.",

SBVr and its cut free subsystem BVr are complete and sound with respect to linear lambda calculus with explicit substitutions. Under any strategy, a sequence of evaluation steps of any linear lambda-term M becomes a process of proof-search in SBVr (BVr) once M is mapped into a formula of SBVr. Completeness and soundness follow from simulating linear beta-reduction with explicit substitutions as processes. The role of the new renaming operator of SBVr is to rename channel-names on-demand. This simulates the substitution that occurs in a beta-reduction. Despite SBVr is a minimal extension of SBV its proof-search can compute all boolean functions, as linear lambda-calculus with explicit substitutions can compute all boolean functions as well. So, proof search of SBVr and BVr is at least ptime-complete.",

We determine upper bounds on the number of different doses levels required for the optimal design and provide conditions under which the boundary points of the design space are included in the optimal design. We also provide an analytical description of the minimally supported $D$-optimal designs and show that they do not depend on the correlation between the bivariate outcomes.

Most methods passively model personal preferences with prior example preferences pairs. We ask whether models benefit from actively inferring preference descriptions, and address this question by creating a synthetic personalized alignment dataset based on famous people with known public preferences. We then test how effective finetuned 1-8B size models are at inferring and aligning to personal preferences. Results show that higher-quality active prefixes lead to better generalization, more contextually faithful models, and less systematic biases across different protected attributes. All our results suggest active alignment can lead to a more controllable and efficient path for personalized alignment.",

      "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have proven to be state-of-the-art models for supervised computer vision tasks, such as image classification. However, large labeled data sets are generally needed for the training and validation of such models. In many domains, unlabeled data is available but labeling is expensive, for instance when specific expert knowledge is required. Active Learning (AL) is one approach to mitigate the problem of limited labeled data. Through selecting the most informative and representative data instances for labeling, AL can contribute to more efficient learning of the model. Recent AL methods for CNNs propose different solutions for the selection of instances to be labeled. However, they do not perform consistently well and are often computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a novel AL algorithm that efficiently learns from unlabeled data by capturing high prediction uncertainty. By replacing the softmax standard output of a CNN with the parameters of a Dirichlet density, the model learns to identify data instances that contribute efficiently to improving model performance during training. We demonstrate in several experiments with publicly available data that our method consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art AL approaches. It can be easily implemented and does not require extensive computational resources for training. Additionally, we are able to show the benefits of the approach on a real-world medical use case in the field of automated detection of visual signals for pneumonia on chest radiographs.",

Recent works have highlighted the importance of joint predictives for (Bayesian) sequential decision making from a theoretical and synthetic perspective. We provide additional practical arguments grounded in real-world applications for focusing on joint predictives: we discuss online Bayesian inference, which would allow us to make predictions while taking into account additional data without retraining, and we propose new challenging evaluation settings using active learning and active sampling. These settings are motivated by an examination of marginal and joint predictives, their respective cross-entropies, and their place in offline and online learning. They are more realistic than previously suggested ones, building on work by Wen et al. (2021) and Osband et al. (2022), and focus on evaluating the performance of approximate BNNs in an online supervised setting. Initial experiments, however, raise questions on the feasibility of these ideas in high-dimensional parameter spaces with current BDL inference techniques, and we suggest experiments that might help shed further light on the practicality of current research for these problems. Importantly, our work highlights previously unidentified gaps in current research and the need for better approximate joint predictives.",

      "abstract": "The problem of causal inference is to determine if a given probability distribution on observed variables is compatible with some causal structure. The difficult case is when the causal structure includes latent variables. We here introduce the $\\textit{inflation technique}$ for tackling this problem. An inflation of a causal structure is a new causal structure that can contain multiple copies of each of the original variables, but where the ancestry of each copy mirrors that of the original. To every distribution of the observed variables that is compatible with the original causal structure, we assign a family of marginal distributions on certain subsets of the copies that are compatible with the inflated causal structure. It follows that compatibility constraints for the inflation can be translated into compatibility constraints for the original causal structure. Even if the constraints at the level of inflation are weak, such as observable statistical independences implied by disjoint causal ancestry, the translated constraints can be strong. We apply this method to derive new inequalities whose violation by a distribution witnesses that distribution's incompatibility with the causal structure (of which Bell inequalities and Pearl's instrumental inequality are prominent examples). We describe an algorithm for deriving all such inequalities for the original causal structure that follow from ancestral independences in the inflation. For three observed binary variables with pairwise common causes, it yields inequalities that are stronger in at least some aspects than those obtainable by existing methods. We also describe an algorithm that derives a weaker set of inequalities but is more efficient. Finally, we discuss which inflations are such that the inequalities one obtains from them remain valid even for quantum (and post-quantum) generalizations of the notion of a causal model.",

      "abstract": "Machine Learning (ML) is a common tool to interpret and predict the behavior of distributed computing systems, e.g., to optimize the task distribution between devices. As more and more data is created by Internet of Things (IoT) devices, data processing and ML training are carried out by edge devices in close proximity. To ensure Quality of Service (QoS) throughout these operations, systems are supervised and dynamically adapted with the help of ML. However, as long as ML models are not retrained, they fail to capture gradual shifts in the variable distribution, leading to an inaccurate view of the system state. Moreover, as the prediction accuracy decreases, the reporting device should actively resolve uncertainties to improve the model's precision. Such a level of self-determination could be provided by Active Inference (ACI) -- a concept from neuroscience that describes how the brain constantly predicts and evaluates sensory information to decrease long-term surprise. We encompassed these concepts in a single action-perception cycle, which we implemented for distributed agents in a smart manufacturing use case. As a result, we showed how our ACI agent was able to quickly and traceably solve an optimization problem while fulfilling QoS requirements.",

The model characterizes linguistic processing as inference over a hierarchical generative model, facilitating predictions and inferences at various levels of granularity, from syllables to sentences. Our approach combines the strengths of large language models for realistic textual predictions and active inference for guiding eye movements to informative textual information, enabling the testing of predictions. The model exhibits proficiency in reading both known and unknown words and sentences, adhering to the distinction between lexical and nonlexical routes in dual route theories of reading. Our model therefore provides a novel approach to understand the cognitive processes underlying reading and eye movements, within a predictive processing framework. Furthermore, our model can potentially aid in understanding how maladaptive predictive processing can produce reading deficits associated with dyslexia. As a proof of concept, we show that attenuating the contribution of priors during the reading process leads to incorrect inferences and a more fragmented reading style, characterized by a greater number of shorter saccades, aligning with empirical findings regarding eye movements in dyslexic individuals. In summary, our model represents a significant advancement in comprehending the cognitive processes involved in reading and eye movements, with potential implications for understanding dyslexia in terms of maladaptive inference.",

Our contribution is to apply Bayesian deep learning framework to visual activity recognition application and quantify model uncertainty along with principled confidence. We utilize the stochastic variational inference technique while training the Bayesian DNNs to infer the approximate posterior distribution around model parameters and perform Monte Carlo sampling on the posterior of model parameters to obtain the predictive distribution. We show that the Bayesian inference applied to DNNs provide reliable confidence measures for visual activity recognition task as compared to conventional DNNs. We also show that our method improves the visual activity recognition precision-recall AUC by 6.2% compared to non-Bayesian baseline.

We show that many bounds characterizations in econometrics, for instance bounds on parameters under conditional moment inequalities, can be formulated as intersection bounds. Our approach is especially convenient for models comprised of a continuum of inequalities that are separable in parameters, and also applies to models with inequalities that are non-separable in parameters. Since analog estimators for intersection bounds can be severely biased in finite samples, routinely underestimating the size of the identified set, we also offer a median-bias-corrected estimator of such bounds as a by-product of our inferential procedures. We develop theory for large sample inference based on the strong approximation of a sequence of series or kernel-based empirical processes by a sequence of \"penultimate\" Gaussian processes. These penultimate processes are generally not weakly convergent, and thus non-Donsker. Our theoretical results establish that we can nonetheless perform asymptotically valid inference based on these processes. Our construction also provides new adaptive inequality/moment selection methods. We provide conditions for the use of nonparametric kernel and series estimators, including a novel result that establishes strong approximation for any general series estimator admitting linearization, which may be of independent interest.",

      "abstract": "Humans perceive and interact with hundreds of objects every day. In doing so, they need to employ mental models of these objects and often exploit symmetries in the object's shape and appearance in order to learn generalizable and transferable skills. Active inference is a first principles approach to understanding and modeling sentient agents. It states that agents entertain a generative model of their environment, and learn and act by minimizing an upper bound on their surprisal, i.e. their Free Energy. The Free Energy decomposes into an accuracy and complexity term, meaning that agents favor the least complex model, that can accurately explain their sensory observations. In this paper, we investigate how inherent symmetries of particular objects also emerge as symmetries in the latent state space of the generative model learnt under deep active inference. In particular, we focus on object-centric representations, which are trained from pixels to predict novel object views as the agent moves its viewpoint. First, we investigate the relation between model complexity and symmetry exploitation in the state space. Second, we do a principal component analysis to demonstrate how the model encodes the principal axis of symmetry of the object in the latent space. Finally, we also demonstrate how more symmetrical representations can be exploited for better generalization in the context of manipulation.",

      "abstract": "The Free Energy Principle (FEP) postulates that biological agents perceive and interact with their environment in order to minimize a Variational Free Energy (VFE) with respect to a generative model of their environment. The inference of a policy (future control sequence) according to the FEP is known as Active Inference (AIF). The AIF literature describes multiple VFE objectives for policy planning that lead to epistemic (information-seeking) behavior. However, most objectives have limited modeling flexibility. This paper approaches epistemic behavior from a constrained Bethe Free Energy (CBFE) perspective. Crucially, variational optimization of the CBFE can be expressed in terms of message passing on free-form generative models. The key intuition behind the CBFE is that we impose a point-mass constraint on predicted outcomes, which explicitly encodes the assumption that the agent will make observations in the future. We interpret the CBFE objective in terms of its constituent behavioral drives. We then illustrate resulting behavior of the CBFE by planning and interacting with a simulated T-maze environment. Simulations for the T-maze task illustrate how the CBFE agent exhibits an epistemic drive, and actively plans ahead to account for the impact of predicted outcomes. Compared to an EFE agent, the CBFE agent incurs expected reward in significantly more environmental scenarios. We conclude that CBFE optimization by message passing suggests a general mechanism for epistemic-aware AIF in free-form generative models.",

      "abstract": "One objective of active matter science is to unveil principles by which chaotic microscale dynamics could be transformed into useful work. A nematic liquid crystal environment offers a number of possibilities, one of which is a directional motion of an active droplet filled with an aqueous dispersion of swimming bacteria. In this work, using the responsiveness of the nematic to the electric field and light, we demonstrate how to control the direction and speed of active droplets. The dielectric response of nematic to the electric field causes two effects: (i) reorientation of the overall director, and (ii) changing the symmetry of the director configuration around the droplet. The first effect redirects the propulsion direction while the second one changes the speed. A laser beam pointed to the vicinity of the droplet can trigger the desired director symmetry around the droplet, by switching between dipolar and quadrupolar configurations, thus affecting the motility and polarity of propulsion. The dynamic tuning of the direction and speed of active droplets represents a step forward in the development of controllable microswimmers.",

      "abstract": "Active inference is a formal approach to study cognition based on the notion that adaptive agents can be seen as engaging in a process of approximate Bayesian inference, via the minimisation of variational and expected free energies. Minimising the former provides an account of perceptual processes and learning as evidence accumulation, while minimising the latter describes how agents select their actions over time. In this way, adaptive agents are able to maximise the likelihood of preferred observations or states, given a generative model of the environment. In the literature, however, different strategies have been proposed to describe how agents can plan their future actions. While they all share the notion that some kind of expected free energy offers an appropriate way to score policies, sequences of actions, in terms of their desirability, there are different ways to consider the contribution of past motor experience to the agent's future behaviour. In some approaches, agents are assumed to know their own actions, and use such knowledge to better plan for the future. In other approaches, agents are unaware of their actions, and must infer their motor behaviour from recent observations in order to plan for the future. This difference reflects a standard point of departure in two leading frameworks in motor control based on the presence, or not, of an efference copy signal representing knowledge about an agent's own actions. In this work we compare the performances of action-aware and action-unaware agents in two navigations tasks, showing how action-unaware agents can achieve performances comparable to action-aware ones while at a severe disadvantage.",

      "abstract": "The discovery of new catalysts that are efficient, sustainable, and low-cost is a major research endeavor for many industrial chemical processes. This requires an understanding and determination of the catalytic origins for the given catalysts, which still remains a challenge. Here we describe a novel method to identify new catalysts based on searching for crystalline symmetry-protected obstructed atomic insulators (OAIs) that have metallic surface states on otherwise semiconducting or insulating compounds. The Wannier charge centers in OAIs are pinned by symmetries at some empty Wyckoff positions so that surfaces that accommodate these sites are guaranteed to have metallic obstructed surface states (OSSs). Beyond the well-studied 2H-MoS2, we further verified our theory on the catalysts, 2H-MoTe2, and 1T'-MoTe2, whose catalytic active sites are consistent with our calculations of obstructed Wannier charge centers (OWCCs) and OSSs. In addition, we have predicted the location of catalytic active sites and confirmed these predictions by exploring the hydrogen evolution reaction on NiPS3 bulk single crystals, which we find to be one of the most promising new catalysts with high activity and, moreover, of low cost. Most importantly, we successfully identified several high-efficient catalysts just by considering the number of OWCCs and the crystal symmetry of the OAIs. Using the real space invariant theory and high-throughput computational methods applied to a database of 34013 topologically trivial insulators, we have identified 1788 unique OAIs (3383 ICSDs), of which 465 are potential high-quality catalysts for heterogeneous reactions. The Miller indices of the active surfaces are also obtained. Our new methodology will facilitate and accelerate the discovery of new catalysts for a wide range of heterogeneous redox reactions, where sustainability, toxicity, and cost must be considered.",

      "abstract": "Inferring the effect of interventions within complex systems is a fundamental problem of statistics. A widely studied approach employs structural causal models that postulate noisy functional relations among a set of interacting variables. The underlying causal structure is then naturally represented by a directed graph whose edges indicate direct causal dependencies. In a recent line of work, additional assumptions on the causal models have been shown to render this causal graph identifiable from observational data alone. One example is the assumption of linear causal relations with equal error variances that we will take up in this work. When the graph structure is known, classical methods may be used for calculating estimates and confidence intervals for causal effects. However, in many applications, expert knowledge that provides an a priori valid causal structure is not available. Lacking alternatives, a commonly used two-step approach first learns a graph and then treats the graph as known in inference. This, however, yields confidence intervals that are overly optimistic and fail to account for the data-driven model choice. We argue that to draw reliable conclusions, it is necessary to incorporate the remaining uncertainty about the underlying causal structure in confidence statements about causal effects. To address this issue, we present a framework based on test inversion that allows us to give confidence regions for total causal effects that capture both sources of uncertainty: causal structure and numerical size of nonzero effects.",

Probability distributions can be seen as particular (formal power) tree series [Berstel et al 82, Esik et al 03], i.e. mappings from trees to a semiring K . A widely studied class of tree series is the class of rational (or recognizable) tree series which can be defined either in an algebraic way or by means of multiplicity tree automata. We argue that the algebraic representation is very convenient to model probability distributions over a free algebra of trees. First, as in the string case, the algebraic representation allows to design learning algorithms for the whole class of probability distributions defined by rational tree series. Note that learning algorithms for rational tree series correspond to learning algorithms for weighted tree automata where both the structure and the weights are learned. Second, the algebraic representation can be easily extended to deal with unranked trees (like XML trees where a symbol may have an unbounded number of children). Both properties are particularly relevant for applications: nondeterministic automata are required for the inference problem to be relevant (recall that Hidden Markov Models are equivalent to nondeterministic string automata); nowadays applications for Web Information Extraction, Web Services and document processing consider unranked trees.",

Based on a far-field analytical model, the low-Reynolds-number locomotion of a self-propelled microswimmer moving inside a clean viscous drop or a drop covered with a homogeneously distributed surfactant, is theoretically examined. The interfacial viscous stresses induced by the surfactant are described by the well-established Boussinesq-Scriven constitutive rheological model. Moreover, the active agent is represented by a force dipole and the resulting fluid-mediated hydrodynamic couplings between the swimmer and the confining drop are investigated. We find that the presence of the surfactant significantly alters the dynamics of the encapsulated swimmer by enhancing its reorientation. Exact solutions for the velocity images for the Stokeslet and dipolar flow singularities inside the drop are introduced and expressed in terms of infinite series of harmonic components. Our results offer useful insights into guiding principles for the control of confined active matter systems and support the objective of utilizing synthetic microswimmers to drive drops for targeted drug delivery applications.",

The architecture implements a multi-agent system where agents self-organize according to Active Inference principles, with preferences and safety constraints flowing through hierarchical Markov blankets. We outline specific mechanisms for ensuring safety, including: (1) explicit separation of beliefs and preferences in natural language, (2) bounded rationality through resource-aware free energy minimization, and (3) compositional safety through modular agent structures.

      "abstract": "Active inference is a state-of-the-art framework for modelling the brain that explains a wide range of mechanisms such as habit formation, dopaminergic discharge and curiosity. Recently, two versions of branching time active inference (BTAI) based on Monte-Carlo tree search have been developed to handle the exponential (space and time) complexity class that occurs when computing the prior over all possible policies up to the time horizon. However, those two versions of BTAI still suffer from an exponential complexity class w.r.t the number of observed and latent variables being modelled. In the present paper, we resolve this limitation by first allowing the modelling of several observations, each of them having its own likelihood mapping. Similarly, we allow each latent state to have its own transition mapping. The inference algorithm then exploits the factorisation of the likelihood and transition mappings to accelerate the computation of the posterior. Those two optimisations were tested on the dSprites environment in which the metadata of the dSprites dataset was used as input to the model instead of the dSprites images. On this task, $BTAI_{VMP}$ (Champion et al., 2022b,a) was able to solve 96.9\\% of the task in 5.1 seconds, and $BTAI_{BF}$ (Champion et al., 2021a) was able to solve 98.6\\% of the task in 17.5 seconds. Our new approach ($BTAI_{3MF}$) outperformed both of its predecessors by solving the task completly (100\\%) in only 2.559 seconds. Finally, $BTAI_{3MF}$ has been implemented in a flexible and easy to use (python) package, and we developed a graphical user interface to enable the inspection of the model's beliefs, planning process and behaviour.",

The proposed approach allows handling partially observable initial states and improves the robustness of classical BTs against unexpected contingencies while at the same time reducing the number of nodes in a tree. In this work, we specify the nominal behavior offline, through BTs. However, in contrast to previous approaches, we introduce a new type of leaf node to specify the desired state to be achieved rather than an action to execute. The decision of which action to execute to reach the desired state is performed online through active inference. This results in continual online planning and hierarchical deliberation. By doing so, an agent can follow a predefined offline plan while still keeping the ability to locally adapt and take autonomous decisions at runtime, respecting safety constraints. We provide proof of convergence and robustness analysis, and we validate our method in two different mobile manipulators performing similar tasks, both in a simulated and real retail environment. The results showed improved runtime adaptability with a fraction of the hand-coded nodes compared to classical BTs.",

      "abstract": "We introduce the Self-Adaptive Goal Generation - Robust Intelligent Adaptive Curiosity (SAGG-RIAC) architecture as an intrinsi- cally motivated goal exploration mechanism which allows active learning of inverse models in high-dimensional redundant robots. This allows a robot to efficiently and actively learn distributions of parameterized motor skills/policies that solve a corresponding distribution of parameterized tasks/goals. The architecture makes the robot sample actively novel parameterized tasks in the task space, based on a measure of competence progress, each of which triggers low-level goal-directed learning of the motor policy pa- rameters that allow to solve it. For both learning and generalization, the system leverages regression techniques which allow to infer the motor policy parameters corresponding to a given novel parameterized task, and based on the previously learnt correspondences between policy and task parameters. We present experiments with high-dimensional continuous sensorimotor spaces in three different robotic setups: 1) learning the inverse kinematics in a highly-redundant robotic arm, 2) learning omnidirectional locomotion with motor primitives in a quadruped robot, 3) an arm learning to control a fishing rod with a flexible wire. We show that 1) exploration in the task space can be a lot faster than exploration in the actuator space for learning inverse models in redundant robots; 2) selecting goals maximizing competence progress creates developmental trajectories driving the robot to progressively focus on tasks of increasing complexity and is statistically significantly more efficient than selecting tasks randomly, as well as more efficient than different standard active motor babbling methods; 3) this architecture allows the robot to actively discover which parts of its task space it can learn to reach and which part it cannot.",

      "abstract": "Deforestation is a compiler optimization that removes intermediate data structure allocations from functional programs to improve their efficiency. This is an old idea, but previous approaches have proved limited or impractical: they either only worked on compositions of predefined combinators (shortcut fusion), or involved the aggressive unfolding of recursive definitions until a depth limit was reached or a reoccurring pattern was found to tie the recursive knot, resulting in impractical algorithmic complexity and large amounts of code duplication. We present Lumberhack, a general-purpose deforestation approach for purely functional call-by-value programs. Lumberhack uses subtype inference to reason about data structure production and consumption and uses an elaboration pass to fuse the corresponding recursive definitions. It fuses large classes of mutually recursive definitions while avoiding much of the unproductive (and sometimes counter-productive) code duplication inherent in previous approaches. We prove the soundness of Lumberhack using logical relations and experimentally demonstrate significant speedups in the standard nofib benchmark suite.",

This is a model of the structure and operation of the neocortex and is under investigation as a new form of artificial intelligence. In their study, learning and inference algorithms running on the system are proposed, where the prediction is an important function. The author believes that one of the most important capabilities of the neocortex in addition to prediction is the ability to make association, that is, to find the relationships between objects. Similarity is an important example of such relationships. In our study, algorithms that run on the thousand-brains system to find similarities are proposed. Although the setting for these algorithms is restricted, the author believes that the case it covers is fundamental. Karl Friston and his colleagues have studied the free-energy principle that explains how the brain actively infers the cause of a Shannon surprise. In our study, an algorithm is proposed for the thousand-brains system to make this inference. The problem of inferring what is being observed from the sensory data is a type of inverse problem, and the inference algorithms of the thousand-brains system and free-energy principle solve this problem in a Bayesian manner. Our inference algorithms can also be interpreted as Bayesian or non-Bayesian updating processes.",

The accurate estimation (or discovery) of these functions from data is a central problem in machine learning, with wide application across the natural and social sciences. Yet current solutions either rely heavily on prior knowledge of the dynamics or involve intricate training procedures. We introduce FIM-SDE (Foundation Inference Model for SDEs), a pretrained recognition model that delivers accurate in-context (or zero-shot) estimation of the drift and diffusion functions of low-dimensional SDEs, from noisy time series data, and allows rapid finetuning to target datasets. Leveraging concepts from amortized inference and neural operators, we (pre)train FIM-SDE in a supervised fashion to map a large set of noisy, discretely observed SDE paths onto the space of drift and diffusion functions. We demonstrate that FIM-SDE achieves robust in-context function estimation across a wide range of synthetic and real-world processes -- from canonical SDE systems (e.g., double-well dynamics or weakly perturbed Lorenz attractors) to stock price recordings and oil-price and wind-speed fluctuations -- while matching the performance of symbolic, Gaussian process and Neural SDE baselines trained on the target datasets. When finetuned to the target processes, we show that FIM-SDE consistently outperforms all these baselines.",

This manifests principally in cooperative communication, that is, intentional communication geared towards aligning mental states. This viewpoint has received ample empirical support. However, this view lacks a formal grounding, and provides no precise neuroscientific hypotheses. To remedy this, we suggest an active inference approach to cooperative communication. We suggest that humans appear to possess an evolved adaptive prior belief that their mental states are aligned with those of conspecifics. Cooperative communication emerges as the principal means to gather evidence for this belief. Our approach has implications for the study of the usage, ontogeny, and cultural evolution of human communication.",

Traditionally, the active monitoring task has been handled through a pipeline of modules such as detection, filtering, and control. However, such methods are difficult to jointly optimize and tune their various parameters for real-time processing in resource constraint systems. In this paper a deep Convolutional Camera Controller Neural Network is proposed to go directly from visual information to camera movement to provide an efficient solution to the active vision problem. It is trained end-to-end without bounding box annotations to control a camera and follow multiple targets from raw pixel values. Evaluation through both a simulation framework and real experimental setup, indicate that the proposed solution is robust to varying conditions and able to achieve better monitoring performance than traditional approaches both in terms of number of targets monitored as well as in effective monitoring time. The advantage of the proposed approach is that it is computationally less demanding and can run at over 10 FPS (~4x speedup) on an embedded smart camera providing a practical and affordable solution to real-time active monitoring.",

A small, 8.5\" long (~1 kpc at the galaxy's distance of 23 Mpc), S-shaped, jet-like feature centered on the nucleus is detected in the 38 ksec ACIS-S integrated exposure of this region. The luminosity of this feature is L_X ~ 2.6 x 10^39 erg/s (0.3-10 keV), and its spectrum is hard (described by a power-law of Gamma = 1.8^{+0.7}_{-0.6}; or by thermal emission with kT > 2 keV). We discuss two possibilities for the origin of this feature: (1) a low-luminosity X-ray jet, or (2) a hot shocked gas. In either case, it is a clear indication of nuclear activity, detectable only in the X-ray band. Steady spherical accretion of the mass losses from the central stellar cusp within the accretion radius, when coupled to a high radiative efficiency, already provides a power source exceeding the observed radiative losses from the nuclear region.",

In addition, we show that our method is not subject to a resolution limit, and can uncover an arbitrarily large number of communities, as long as there is statistical evidence for them. Our formulation is amenable to model selection procedures, which allow us to compare it to more general approaches based on the stochastic block model, and in this way reveal whether assortativity is in fact the dominating large-scale mixing pattern.

While recent approaches, such as Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), leverage selective activation but require specialized training, training-free sparse activation methods offer broader applicability and superior resource efficiency through their plug-and-play design. However, many existing methods rely solely on hidden state magnitudes to determine activation, resulting in high approximation errors and suboptimal inference accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose WINA (Weight Informed Neuron Activation), a novel, simple, and training-free sparse activation framework that jointly considers hidden state magnitudes and the column-wise $\\ell_2$-norms of weight matrices. We show that this leads to a sparsification strategy that obtains optimal approximation error bounds with theoretical guarantees tighter than existing techniques. Empirically, WINA also outperforms state-of-the-art methods (e.g., TEAL) by up to $2.94\\%$ in average performance at the same sparsity levels, across a diverse set of LLM architectures and datasets. These results position WINA as a new performance frontier for training-free sparse activation in LLM inference, advancing training-free sparse activation methods and setting a robust baseline for efficient inference.

The selective inference approach solves this bias by conditioning on the selection event. Most existing studies of selective inference consider a specific algorithm, such as Lasso, for feature selection, and thus they have difficulties in handling more complicated algorithms. Moreover, existing studies often consider unnecessarily restrictive events, leading to over-conditioning and lower statistical power. Our novel and widely-applicable resampling method via multiscale bootstrap addresses these issues to compute an approximately unbiased selective $p$-value for the selected features. As a simplification of the proposed method, we also develop a simpler method via the classical bootstrap. We prove that the $p$-value computed by our multiscale bootstrap method is more accurate than the classical bootstrap method. Furthermore, numerical experiments demonstrate that our algorithm works well even for more complicated feature selection methods such as non-convex regularization.",

      "abstract": "Traditional methods for biological shape inference, such as deep learning (DL) and active contour models, face important limitations in 3D. DL approaches require large annotated datasets, which are often impractical to obtain, while active contour methods depend on carefully tuned heuristics for intensity attraction and shape regularization. We introduce deltaMic, a novel differentiable 3D renderer for fluorescence microscopy that formulates shape inference as an inverse problem. By leveraging differentiable convolutions, deltaMic simulates the image formation process, integrating a parameterized point spread function (PSF) with a triangle mesh-based representation of biological structures. Unlike DL- or contour-based segmentation, deltaMic directly optimizes both shape and optical parameters to align synthetic and real microscopy images, removing the need for large datasets or sample-specific fine-tuning. To ensure scalability, we implement a GPU-accelerated Fourier transform for triangle meshes along with narrow-band spectral filtering. We show that deltaMic accurately reconstructs cell geometries from both synthetic and diverse experimental 3D microscopy data, while remaining robust to noise and initialization. This establishes a new physics-informed framework for biophysical image analysis and inverse modeling.",

Recent research has proposed replacing SiLU with ReLU to induce significant activation sparsity and showed no downstream task accuracy degradation through fine tuning. However, taking full advantage of it required training a predictor to estimate this sparsity. In this paper, we introduce SparseInfer, a simple, light weight, and training free predictor for activation sparsity of ReLU field LLMs, in which activation sparsity is predicted by comparing only the sign bits of inputs and weights. To compensate for possible prediction inaccuracy, an adaptive tuning of the predictor's conservativeness is enabled, which can also serve as a control knob for optimizing LLM inference. The proposed method achieves approximately faster inference speed over the state of the art, with negligible accuracy loss of within 1%p.",

While the framework has seen significant advancements in the development of agents, the environmental models are often borrowed from reinforcement learning problems, which may not fully capture the complexity of multi-agent interactions or allow complex, conditional communication. This paper introduces Reactive Environments, a comprehensive paradigm that facilitates complex multi-agent communication. In this paradigm, both agents and environments are defined as entities encapsulated by boundaries with interfaces. This setup facilitates a robust framework for communication in nonequilibrium-Steady-State systems, allowing for complex interactions and information exchange. We present a Julia package RxEnvironments.jl, which is a specific implementation of Reactive Environments, where we utilize a Reactive Programming style for efficient implementation. The flexibility of this paradigm is demonstrated through its application to several complex, multi-agent environments.

Classically, different regularization methods and Bayesian inference based methods have been proposed.

Using Deep Neural Network surrogate models and approximate computation can become very helpful. However, accounting for the uncertainties, we need first understand the Bayesian Deep Learning and then, we can see how we can use them for inverse problems. In this work, we focus on NN, DL and more specifically the Bayesian DL particularly adapted for inverse problems. We first give details of Bayesian DL approximate computations with exponential families, then we will see how we can use them for inverse problems.

      "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown great promise for efficiently learning force control policies in peg-in-hole tasks. However, robots often face difficulties due to visual occlusions by the gripper and uncertainties in the initial grasping pose of the peg. These challenges often restrict force-controlled insertion policies to situations where the peg is rigidly fixed to the end-effector. While vision-based tactile sensors offer rich tactile feedback that could potentially address these issues, utilizing them to learn effective tactile policies is both computationally intensive and difficult to generalize. In this paper, we propose a robust tactile insertion policy that can align the tilted peg with the hole using active inference, without the need for extensive training on large datasets. Our approach employs a dual-policy architecture: one policy focuses on insertion, integrating force control and RL to guide the object into the hole, while the other policy performs active inference based on tactile feedback to align the tilted peg with the hole. In real-world experiments, our dual-policy architecture achieved 90% success rate into a hole with a clearance of less than 0.1 mm, significantly outperforming previous methods that lack tactile sensory feedback (5%). To assess the generalizability of our alignment policy, we conducted experiments with five different pegs, demonstrating its effective adaptation to multiple objects.",

This paper proposes an alternative approach for approximate evaluation of conjunctive queries with standard relational databases: In our approach, every query is evaluated entirely in the database engine by evaluating a fixed number of query plans, each providing an upper bound on the true probability, then taking their minimum. We provide an algorithm that takes into account important schema information to enumerate only the minimal necessary plans among all possible plans. Importantly, this algorithm is a strict generalization of all known PTIME self-join-free conjunctive queries: A query is in PTIME if and only if our algorithm returns one single plan. Furthermore, our approach is a generalization of a family of efficient ranking methods from graphs to hypergraphs. We also adapt three relational query optimization techniques to evaluate all necessary plans very fast. We give a detailed experimental evaluation of our approach and, in the process, provide a new way of thinking about the value of probabilistic methods over non-probabilistic methods for ranking query answers. We also note that the techniques developed in this paper apply immediately to lifted inference from statistical relational models since lifted inference corresponds to PTIME plans in probabilistic databases.",

It is crucial to prepare for these surveys now and develop tools that can efficiently extract most information. We present HIFlow: a fast generative model of the neutral hydrogen (HI) maps that is conditioned only on cosmology ($Ω_{m}$ and $σ_{8}$) and designed using a class of normalizing flow models, the Masked Autoregressive Flow (MAF). HIFlow is trained on the state-of-the-art simulations from the Cosmology and Astrophysics with MachinE Learning Simulations (CAMELS) project. HIFlow has the ability to generate realistic diverse maps without explicitly incorporating the expected 2D maps structure into the flow as an inductive bias. We find that HIFlow is able to reproduce the CAMELS average and standard deviation HI power spectrum (Pk) within a factor of $\\lesssim$ 2, scoring a very high $R^{2} > 90\\%$. By inverting the flow, HIFlow provides a tractable high-dimensional likelihood for efficient parameter inference. We show that the conditional HIFlow on cosmology is successfully able to marginalize over astrophysics at the field level, regardless of the stellar and AGN feedback strengths. This new tool represents a first step toward a more powerful parameter inference, maximizing the scientific return of future HI surveys, and opening a new avenue to minimize the loss of complex information due to data compression down to summary statistics.",

We propose exact theoretical solutions for optimal allocation in $2^K$ factorial experiments under complete randomization with A-, D- and E-optimality criteria. We then extend this work to factorial designs with block randomization. We also derive results for optimal allocations when using cost-based constraints. To connect our theory to practice, we provide convenient integer-constrained programming solutions using a greedy optimization approach to find integer optimal allocation solutions for both complete and block randomization.

      "abstract": "Active Inference (ActInf) is an emerging theory that explains perception and action in biological agents, in terms of minimizing a free energy bound on Bayesian surprise. Goal-directed behavior is elicited by introducing prior beliefs on the underlying generative model. In contrast to prior beliefs, which constrain all realizations of a random variable, we propose an alternative approach through chance constraints, which allow for a (typically small) probability of constraint violation, and demonstrate how such constraints can be used as intrinsic drivers for goal-directed behavior in ActInf. We illustrate how chance-constrained ActInf weights all imposed (prior) constraints on the generative model, allowing e.g., for a trade-off between robust control and empirical chance constraint violation. Secondly, we interpret the proposed solution within a message passing framework. Interestingly, the message passing interpretation is not only relevant to the context of ActInf, but also provides a general purpose approach that can account for chance constraints on graphical models. The chance constraint message updates can then be readily combined with other pre-derived message update rules, without the need for custom derivations. The proposed chance-constrained message passing framework thus accelerates the search for workable models in general, and can be used to complement message-passing formulations on generative neural models.",

The success of deep learning based object detectors relies on the availability of large-scale annotated datasets, which is time-consuming and expensive to compile, especially for 3D bounding box annotation. In this work, we investigate diversity-based active learning (AL) as a potential solution to alleviate the annotation burden. Given limited annotation budget, only the most informative frames and objects are automatically selected for human to annotate. Technically, we take the advantage of the multimodal information provided in an AV dataset, and propose a novel acquisition function that enforces spatial and temporal diversity in the selected samples. We benchmark the proposed method against other AL strategies under realistic annotation cost measurement, where the realistic costs for annotating a frame and a 3D bounding box are both taken into consideration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on the nuScenes dataset and show that it outperforms existing AL strategies significantly.

      "abstract": "In recent years, active learning has been successfully applied to an array of NLP tasks. However, prior work often assumes that training and test data are drawn from the same distribution. This is problematic, as in real-life settings data may stem from several sources of varying relevance and quality. We show that four popular active learning schemes fail to outperform random selection when applied to unlabelled pools comprised of multiple data sources on the task of natural language inference. We reveal that uncertainty-based strategies perform poorly due to the acquisition of collective outliers, i.e., hard-to-learn instances that hamper learning and generalization. When outliers are removed, strategies are found to recover and outperform random baselines. In further analysis, we find that collective outliers vary in form between sources, and show that hard-to-learn data is not always categorically harmful. Lastly, we leverage dataset cartography to introduce difficulty-stratified testing and find that different strategies are affected differently by example learnability and difficulty.",

      "abstract": "In the last decade, the free energy principle (FEP) and active inference (AIF) have achieved many successes connecting conceptual models of learning and cognition to mathematical models of perception and action. This effort is driven by a multidisciplinary interest in understanding aspects of self-organizing complex adaptive systems, including elements of agency. Various reinforcement learning (RL) models performing active inference have been proposed and trained on standard RL tasks using deep neural networks. Recent work has focused on improving such agents' performance in complex environments by incorporating the latest machine learning techniques. In this paper, we take an alternative approach. Within the constraints imposed by the FEP and AIF, we attempt to model agents in an interpretable way without deep neural networks by introducing Free Energy Projective Simulation (FEPS). Using internal rewards only, FEPS agents build a representation of their partially observable environments with which they interact. Following AIF, the policy to achieve a given task is derived from this world model by minimizing the expected free energy. Leveraging the interpretability of the model, techniques are introduced to deal with long-term goals and reduce prediction errors caused by erroneous hidden state estimation. We test the FEPS model on two RL environments inspired from behavioral biology: a timed response task and a navigation task in a partially observable grid. Our results show that FEPS agents fully resolve the ambiguity of both environments by appropriately contextualizing their observations based on prediction accuracy only. In addition, they infer optimal policies flexibly for any target observation in the environment.",

      "abstract": "The directed motion of active colloids is governed by spatial variations in surface chemistry and interfacial stress, yet these properties remain extremely difficult to measure directly. We introduce a physics-informed neural network framework that infers the slip distribution driving propulsion from partial observations of the surrounding flow. By combining sparse fluid velocity measurements with the Stokes equations and boundary constraints, the method reconstructs both the near-surface slip and the full velocity and pressure fields. Validation against analytical solutions and Boundary Element Method calculations for canonical active colloid models shows quantitative agreement in both unbounded and confined geometries. Crucially, the framework recovers the surface slip even when no flow data are available near the particle, demonstrating that accessible bulk measurements encode the interfacial stresses responsible for active motion. These results establish physics-informed inference as a powerful tool for characterizing and ultimately controlling interfacially driven transport in colloidal active matter.",

The beam energy above 80 GeV is derived from continuous measurements of the magnetic bending field by 16 NMR probes situated in a number of the LEP dipoles. The relationship between the fields measured by the probes and the beam energy is calibrated against precise measurements of the average beam energy between 41 and 55 GeV made using the resonant depolarisation technique. The linearity of the relationship is tested by comparing the fields measured by the probes with the total bending field measured by a flux loop. This test results in the largest contribution to the systematic uncertainty. Several further corrections are applied to derive the the centre-of-mass energies at each interaction point. In addition the centre-of-mass energy spread is evaluated. The beam energy has been determined with a precision of 25 MeV for the data taken in 1997, corresponding to a relative precision of 2.7x10^{-4}. This is small in comparison to the present uncertainty on the W mass measurement at LEP. However, the ultimate statistical precision on the W mass with the full LEP2 data sample should be around 25 MeV, and a smaller uncertainty on the beam energy is desirable.

Accurate knowledge of these energies is of primary importance to set the absolute energy scale for the measurement of the W boson mass. The beam energy between 80 and 104 GeV is derived from continuous measurements of the magnetic bending field by 16 NMR probes situated in a number of the LEP dipoles. The relationship between the fields measured by the probes and the beam energy is defined in the NMR model, which is calibrated against precise measurements of the average beam energy between 41 and 61 GeV made using the resonant depolarisation technique. The validity of the NMR model is verified by three independent methods: the flux-loop, which is sensitive to the bending field of all the dipoles of LEP; the spectrometer, which determines the energy through measurements of the deflection of the beam in a magnet of known integrated field; and an analysis of the variation of the synchrotron tune with the total RF voltage. To obtain the centre-of-mass energies, corrections are then applied to account for sources of bending field external to the dipoles, and variations in the local beam energy at each interaction point. The relative error on the centre-of-mass energy determination for the majority of LEP 2 running is 1.2 x 10^{-4}, which is sufficiently precise so as not to introduce a dominant uncertainty on the W mass measurement.",

In this work, we revisit Boltzmann Generator to motivate the construction of the loss function from the statistical mechanical point of view, and to cast the training of the neural networks in a purely unsupervised manner that requires no samples of the atomic configurations from the equilibrium ensemble. We further show that the normalizing flow framework furnishes a reference thermodynamic system, very close to the real thermodynamic system under consideration, that is suitable for the well-established free energy perturbation methods to determine accurate free energy of solids. We then apply the normalizing flow to two problems: temperature-dependent Gibbs free energy of perfect crystal and formation free energy of monovacancy defect in a model system of diamond cubic Si. The results obtained from the normalizing flow are shown to be in good agreement with that obtained from independent well-established free energy methods.",

In addition, there exist new bound states of haplons with no counterpart in the SM, having a mass of the order of 0.5 TeV up to a few TeV. In particular, a neutral scalar state with haplon number 4 is stable and can provide the dark matter in the universe. The QHD, QCD and QED couplings can unify at the Planck scale.

      "abstract": "In this paper, we unite concepts from Husserlian phenomenology, the active inference framework in theoretical biology, and category theory in mathematics to develop a comprehensive framework for understanding social action premised on shared goals. We begin with an overview of Husserlian phenomenology, focusing on aspects of inner time-consciousness, namely, retention, primal impression, and protention. We then review active inference as a formal approach to modeling agent behavior based on variational (approximate Bayesian) inference. Expanding upon Husserl’s model of time consciousness, we consider collective goal-directed behavior, emphasizing shared protentions among agents and their connection to the shared generative models of active inference. This integrated framework aims to formalize shared goals in terms of shared protentions, and thereby shed light on the emergence of group intentionality. Building on this foundation, we incorporate mathematical tools from category theory, in particular, sheaf and topos theory, to furnish a mathematical image of individual and group interactions within a stochastic environment. Specifically, we employ morphisms between polynomial representations of individual agent models, allowing predictions not only of their own behaviors but also those of other agents and environmental responses. Sheaf and topos theory facilitates the construction of coherent agent worldviews and provides a way of representing consensus or shared understanding. We explore the emergence of shared protentions, bridging the phenomenology of temporal structure, multi-agent active inference systems, and category theory. Shared protentions are highlighted as pivotal for coordination and achieving common objectives. We conclude by acknowledging the intricacies stemming from stochastic systems and uncertainties in realizing shared goals.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Active inference is a probabilistic framework for modeling the behavior of biological and artificial agents, which derives from the principle of minimizing free energy. In recent years, this framework has been applied successfully to a variety of situations where the goal was to maximize reward, often offering comparable and sometimes superior performance to alternative approaches. In this article, we clarify the connection between reward maximization and active inference by demonstrating how and when active inference agents execute actions that are optimal for maximizing reward. Precisely, we show the conditions under which active inference produces the optimal solution to the Bellman equation, a formulation that underlies several approaches to model-based reinforcement learning and control. On partially observed Markov decision processes, the standard active inference scheme can produce Bellman optimal actions for planning horizons of 1 but not beyond. In contrast, a recently developed recursive active inference scheme (sophisticated inference) can produce Bellman optimal actions on any finite temporal horizon. We append the analysis with a discussion of the broader relationship between active inference and reinforcement learning.",

      "abstract": "Social neuroscience has often been criticized for approaching the investigation of the neural processes that enable social interaction and cognition from a passive, detached, third-person perspective, without involving any real-time social interaction. With the emergence of second-person neuroscience, investigators have uncovered the unique complexity of neural-activation patterns in actual, real-time interaction. Social cognition that occurs during social interaction is fundamentally different from that unfolding during social observation. However, it remains unclear how the neural correlates of social interaction are to be interpreted. Here, we leverage the active-inference framework to shed light on the mechanisms at play during social interaction in second-person neuroscience studies. Specifically, we show how counterfactually rich mutual predictions, real-time bodily adaptation, and policy selection explain activation in components of the default mode, salience, and frontoparietal networks of the brain, as well as in the basal ganglia. We further argue that these processes constitute the crucial neural processes that underwrite bona fide social interaction. By placing the experimental approach of second-person neuroscience on the theoretical foundation of the active-inference framework, we inform the field of social neuroscience about the mechanisms of real-life interactions. We thereby contribute to the theoretical foundations of empirical second-person neuroscience.",

      "abstract": "How to account for the power that art holds over us? Why do artworks touch us deeply, consoling, transforming or invigorating us in the process? In this paper, we argue that an answer to this question might emerge from a fecund framework in cognitive science known as predictive processing (a.k.a. active inference). We unpack how this approach connects sense-making and aesthetic experiences through the idea of an ‘epistemic arc’, consisting of three parts (curiosity, epistemic action and aha experiences), which we cast as aspects of active inference. We then show how epistemic arcs are built and sustained by artworks to provide us with those satisfying experiences that we tend to call ‘aesthetic’. Next, we defuse two key objections to this approach; namely, that it places undue emphasis on the cognitive component of our aesthetic encounters—at the expense of affective aspects—and on closure and uncertainty minimization (order)—at the expense of openness and lingering uncertainty (change). We show that the approach offers crucial resources to account for the open-ended, free and playful behaviour inherent in aesthetic experiences. The upshot is a promising but deflationary approach, both philosophically informed and psychologically sound, that opens new empirical avenues for understanding our aesthetic encounters. This article is part of the theme issue ‘Art, aesthetics and predictive processing: theoretical and empirical perspectives’.",

Traditional deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based approaches have been used to offload LLM inference tasks to servers.

In this paper, we propose an active inference with rewardless guidance algorithm using expected future free energy for offloading decisions and allocating resources for the LLM inference task offloading and resource allocation problem of cloud-edge networks systems. Experimental results show that our proposed method has superior performance over mainstream DRLs, improves in data utilization efficiency, and is more adaptable to changing task load scenarios.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESIS\nActive inference has become an influential concept in psychopathology. We apply active inference to investigate conceptual disorganization in first-episode schizophrenia. We conceptualize speech production as a decision-making process affected by the latent \"conceptual organization\"-as a special case of uncertainty about the causes of sensory information. Uncertainty is both minimized via speech production-in which function words index conceptual organization in terms of analytic thinking-and tracked by a domain-general salience network. We hypothesize that analytic thinking depends on conceptual organization. Therefore, conceptual disorganization in schizophrenia would be both indexed by low conceptual organization and reflected in the effective connectivity within the salience network.\n\n\nSTUDY DESIGN\nWith 1-minute speech samples from a picture description task and resting state fMRI from 30 patients and 30 healthy subjects, we employed dynamic causal and probabilistic graphical models to investigate if the effective connectivity of the salience network underwrites conceptual organization.\n\n\nSTUDY RESULTS\nLow analytic thinking scores index low conceptual organization which affects diagnostic status. The influence of the anterior insula on the anterior cingulate cortex and the self-inhibition within the anterior cingulate cortex are elevated given low conceptual organization (ie, conceptual disorganization).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nConceptual organization, a construct that explains formal thought disorder, can be modeled in an active inference framework and studied in relation to putative neural substrates of disrupted language in schizophrenia. This provides a critical advance to move away from rating-scale scores to deeper constructs in the pursuit of the pathophysiology of formal thought disorder.",

We then review classical and quantum formulations of the FEP, with the former being the classical limit of the latter. In the accompanying Part II, we show that when systems are described as executing active inference driven by the FEP, their control flow systems can always be represented as tensor networks (TNs).

Despite being experienced as a continuous flow, computational models of consciousness are typically restricted to a sequential temporal structure. This difference poses a serious challenge for computational phenomenology—a novel field combining phenomenology and computational modelling. By analysing the temporal structure of the active inference framework, we show that an integrated continuity of time can be achieved by merging Husserlian temporality with a sequential order of time. We also show that a Markov blanket of the present moment integrates past and future moments of both subjective temporality and objective time in an asynchronous manner. By applying the integrated continuity, it is clear that active inference makes use of both subjective temporality and objective time in an integrated fashion. We conclude that active inference, on a temporal note, qualifies as a computational model for phenomenological investigations.",

Through a comprehensive literature review and based on the average transverse momentum or the root-mean-square transverse momentum, we propose model-independent parameters to address these inconsistencies. The relevant parameters include: the initial temperature, the effective temperature, the kinetic freeze-out temperature, and the average transverse velocity. Our findings indicate that these four parameters are larger in central collisions, within central rapidity regions, at higher energies, and in larger collision systems. As collision energy increases, excitation functions for all four parameters rise rapidly (slowly) within ranges below (above) approximately 7.7 GeV. At higher energies (>39) GeV, fluctuations occur in trends for these excitation functions, with only slight changes observed in their growth rates. Additionally, this work reveals a mass-dependent multi-temperature scenario pertaining to both initial states and kinetic freeze-out processes.",

We found that holographic and new agegraphic $f(R)$ gravity models can behave like phantom or quintessence models in the spatially flat FRW universe. We also found a distinct term in the form of $f(R)$ which goes as $R^{\\frac{3}{2}}$ due to the consideration of the GUP modified energy densities. Although the presence of this term in the action can have its importance in explaining the early inflationary scenario but Capozziello {\\it et.al.} recently showed that $f(R) \\sim R^{\\frac{3}{2}}$ leads to an accelerated expansion, {\\it i.e.}, a negative value for the deceleration parameter $q$ which fit well with SNeIa and WMAP data.",

The sound speed is related to the width or standard deviation of the Gaussian rapidity distribution of hadrons. The extracted square speed of sound lies within a range from 0 to 1/3 in most cases.

We introduce a prediction-free two-stage coordinated optimization framework, which generates the annual state-of-charge (SoC) reference for hydrogen storage offline. During online operation, it updates the SoC reference online using kernel regression and makes operation decisions based on the proposed adaptive virtual-queue-based online convex optimization (OCO) algorithm. We innovatively incorporate penalty terms for long-term pattern tracking and expert-tracking for step size updates. We provide theoretical proof to show that the proposed OCO algorithm achieves a sublinear bound of dynamic regret without using prediction information. Numerical studies based on the Elia and North China datasets show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms the existing online optimization approaches by reducing the operational costs and loss of load by around 30% and 80%, respectively. These benefits can be further enhanced with optimized settings for the penalty coefficient and step size of OCO, as well as more historical references.",

In this work, we studied the affect of surface free energy anisotropies on the development kinetics of the 'Stranski-Krastanow' island type morphology. The anisotropic surface free energy and the surface stiffness were treated with well accepted trigonometric functions. Although, various tilt angles and anisotropy constants were considered during simulations, the main emphasis was given on the effect of rotational symmetries associated with the surface Helmholtz free energy topography in 2D space. Our computer simulations revealed the formation of an extremely thin wetting layer during the development of the bell-shaped Stranski-Krastanow island through the mass accumulation at the central region of the droplet via surface drift-diffusion. In the strong (anomalous) anisotropy constant domain, we demonstrated the existence of two distinct morphological modes: i) the complete stability of the initial Cosine-shaped droplet just above a certain anisotropy constant threshold level by spontaneous slight readjustments of the base and the height of the cluster; ii) the Frank-van der Merwe mode of thin film formation for very large values of the anisotropy constant by the spreading and coalescence of the droplets over the substrate surface. During the course of the simulations, we have continuously tracked both the morphology (i.e., the peak height, the extension of the wetting layer beyond the domain boundaries, and the triple junction contact angle) and energetic (the global Helmholtz free energy changes associated with the total strain and surface energy variations) of the system.",

The hypothesis of reductionism finds no obstacle within contemporary natural sciences. Determinism in classical physics is irrefutable, unless classical physics is itself refuted. From quantum mechanics, some authors argue that free will is possible because there is an ontological indeterminism in the natural laws, and that the mind is responsible for the wave function collapse of matter, which leads to a choice among the different possibilities for the body. However, here I defend the opposite thesis because indeterminism does not imply free will, and because the considerations about an autonomous mind sending orders to the body is against neuroscience or evolutionary theories about human beings. The quantum theory of measurement can be interpreted without the intervention of human minds, but other fields of science cannot contemplate the mentalist scenario. A fatalistic or materialist view, which denies the possibility of a free will, makes much more sense in scientific terms.",

The $F_Q(T)$s of these models are directly computed by explicit sampling of the matrix ensembles, and how their properties are connected to the statistical mechanics of the underlying discrete spectrum of the ensembles is elucidated. Some of the low temperature ($T$) features of the results confirm recent observations by Jassen and Mirbabayi. The results are then used as benchmarks for exploring an intriguing formula proposed by Okuyama for computing $F_Q(T)$ in terms of the connected correlators of its partition function, the wormholes of the gravity theory. A low $T$ truncation of the correlators helps render the formula practical, but it is shown that this is at the expense of much of its accuracy. The significance of the statistical interpretation of $F_Q(T)$ for black hole microphysics is discussed.",

The ensuing statistical independencies, mediated by Markov blankets, speak to a recursive composition of ensembles (of things) at increasingly higher spatiotemporal scales. This decomposition provides a description of small things; e.g., quantum mechanics - via the Schrodinger equation, ensembles of small things - via statistical mechanics and related fluctuation theorems, through to big things - via classical mechanics. These descriptions are complemented with a Bayesian mechanics for autonomous or active things. Although this work provides a formulation of every thing, its main contribution is to examine the implications of Markov blankets for self-organisation to nonequilibrium steady-state. In brief, we recover an information geometry and accompanying free energy principle that allows one to interpret the internal states of something as representing or making inferences about its external states. The ensuing Bayesian mechanics is compatible with quantum, statistical and classical mechanics and may offer a formal description of lifelike particles.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The free energy principle and its corollary, the active inference framework, serve as theoretical foundations in the domain of neuroscience, explaining the genesis of intelligent behavior. This principle states that the processes of perception, learning, and decision making—within an agent—are all driven by the objective of “minimizing free energy,” evincing the following behaviors: learning and employing a generative model of the environment to interpret observations, thereby achieving perception, and selecting actions to maintain a stable preferred state and minimize the uncertainty about the environment, thereby achieving decision making. This fundamental principle can be used to explain how the brain processes perceptual information, learns about the environment, and selects actions. Two pivotal tenets are that the agent employs a generative model for perception and planning and that interaction with the world (and other agents) enhances the performance of the generative model and augments perception. With the evolution of control theory and deep learning tools, agents based on the FEP have been instantiated in various ways across different domains, guiding the design of a multitude of generative models and decision-making algorithms. This letter first introduces the basic concepts of the FEP, followed by its historical development and connections with other theories of intelligence, and then delves into the specific application of the FEP to perception and decision making, encompassing both low-dimensional simple situations and high-dimensional complex situations. It compares the FEP with model-based reinforcement learning to show that the FEP provides a better objective function. We illustrate this using numerical studies of Dreamer3 by adding expected information gain into the standard objective function. In a complementary fashion, existing reinforcement learning, and deep learning algorithms can also help implement the FEP-based agents. Finally, we discuss the various capabilities that agents need to possess in complex environments and state that the FEP can aid agents in acquiring these capabilities.",

      "abstract": "\n\n\nSeveral authors have made claims about the compatibility between the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and theories of autopoiesis and enaction. Many see these theories as natural partners or as making similar statements about the nature of biological and cognitive systems. We critically examine these claims and identify a series of misreadings and misinterpretations of key enactive concepts. In particular, we notice a tendency to disregard the operational definition of autopoiesis and the distinction between a system’s structure and its organization. Other misreadings concern the conflation of processes of self-distinction in operationally closed systems and Markov blankets. Deeper theoretical tensions underlie some of these misinterpretations. FEP assumes systems that reach a non-equilibrium steady state and are enveloped by a Markov blanket. We argue that these assumptions contradict the historicity of sense-making that is explicit in the enactive approach. Enactive concepts such as adaptivity and agency are defined in terms of the modulation of parameters and constraints of the agent-environment coupling, which entail the possibility of changes in variable and parameter sets, constraints, and in the dynamical laws affecting the system. This allows enaction to address the path-dependent diversity of human bodies and minds. We argue that these ideas are incompatible with the time invariance of non-equilibrium steady states assumed by the FEP. In addition, the enactive perspective foregrounds the enabling and constitutive roles played by the world in sense-making, agency, development. We argue that this view of transactional and constitutive relations between organisms and environments is a challenge to the FEP. Once we move beyond superficial similarities, identify misreadings, and examine the theoretical commitments of the two approaches, we reach the conclusion that far from being easily integrated, the FEP, as it stands formulated today, is in tension with the theories of autopoiesis and enaction.\n\n\n",

      "abstract": "This study explains how the leader-follower relationship and turn-taking could develop in a dyadic imitative interaction by conducting robotic simulation experiments based on the free energy principle. Our prior study showed that introducing a parameter during the model training phase can determine leader and follower roles for subsequent imitative interactions. The parameter is defined as w, the so-called meta-prior, and is a weighting factor used to regulate the complexity term versus the accuracy term when minimizing the free energy. This can be read as sensory attenuation, in which the robot’s prior beliefs about action are less sensitive to sensory evidence. The current extended study examines the possibility that the leader-follower relationship shifts depending on changes in w during the interaction phase. We identified a phase space structure with three distinct types of behavioral coordination using comprehensive simulation experiments with sweeps of w of both robots during the interaction. Ignoring behavior in which the robots follow their own intention was observed in the region in which both ws were set to large values. One robot leading, followed by the other robot was observed when one w was set larger and the other was set smaller. Spontaneous, random turn-taking between the leader and the follower was observed when both ws were set at smaller or intermediate values. Finally, we examined a case of slowly oscillating w in anti-phase between the two agents during the interaction. The simulation experiment resulted in turn-taking in which the leader-follower relationship switched during determined sequences, accompanied by periodic shifts of ws. An analysis using transfer entropy found that the direction of information flow between the two agents also shifted along with turn-taking. Herein, we discuss qualitative differences between random/spontaneous turn-taking and agreed-upon sequential turn-taking by reviewing both synthetic and empirical studies.",

Using a recently established reverse engineering technique, we confirm the quantitative predictions of the free-energy principle using in vitro networks of rat cortical neurons that perform causal inference. Upon receiving electrical stimuli—generated by mixing two hidden sources—neurons self-organised to selectively encode the two sources. Pharmacological up- and downregulation of network excitability disrupted the ensuing inference, consistent with changes in prior beliefs about hidden sources. As predicted, changes in effective synaptic connectivity reduced variational free energy, where the connection strengths encoded parameters of the generative model. In short, we show that variational free energy minimisation can quantitatively predict the self-organisation of neuronal networks, in terms of their responses and plasticity. These results demonstrate the applicability of the free-energy principle to in vitro neural networks and establish its predictive validity in this setting.",

In this paper, I suggest an extension of the monitor model to incorporate aspects of relevance theory (RT) and to adopt the free energy principle (FEP) as a generative model to elucidate translational behaviour. The FEP—and its corollary, active inference—provide a general, mathematical framework to explain how organisms resist entropic erosion so as to remain within their phenotypic bounds. It posits that organisms reduce the gap between their expectations and observations by minimising a quantity called free energy. I map these concepts on the translation process and exemplify them with behavioural data. The analysis is based on the notion of translation units (TUs) which exhibit observable traces of the translator’s epistemic and pragmatic engagement with their translation environment, (i.e., the text) that can be measured in terms of translation effort and effects. Sequences of TUs cluster into translation states (steady state, orientation, and hesitation). Drawing on active inference, sequences of translation states combine into translation policies that reduce expected free energy. I show how the notion of free energy is compatible with the concept of relevance, as developed in RT, and how essential concepts of the monitor model and RT can be formalised as deep temporal generative models that can be interpreted under a representationalist view, but also support a non-representationalist account.",

Methods In this observational study, we used a four-dimensional ultrasound technique obtained to collect images of fetal faces from pregnancies at 27–37 weeks of gestation, between February and December 2021. We developed an artificial intelligence classifier that recognizes fetal facial expressions, which are thought to relate to fetal brain activity. We then applied the classifier to video files of facial images to generate each expression category’s probabilities. We calculated the chaotic dimensions from the probability lists, and we created and investigated the free energy principle’s mathematical model that was assumed to be linked to the chaotic dimension. We used a Mann–Whitney test, linear regression test, and one-way analysis of variance for statistical analysis. Results The chaotic dimension revealed that the fetus had dense and sparse states of brain activity, which fluctuated at a statistically significant level. The chaotic dimension and free energy were larger in the sparse state than in the dense state. Conclusions The fluctuating free energy suggests consciousness seemed to exist in the fetus after 27 weeks.",

Many researchers have expressed doubts regarding the actual integration of PP with the FEP, questioning whether the FEP can truly contribute significantly to the mechanistic understanding of PP or even undermine such integration altogether. In this paper, I present an alternative perspective. I argue that, from the viewpoint of the constraint-based mechanisms approach, the FEP imposes an important constraint, namely variational free energy, on the mechanistic architecture proposed by PP. According to the constraint-based mechanisms approach, high-level cognitive mechanisms are integral parts of extensive heterarchical networks that govern the physiology and behavior of agents. Consequently, mechanistic explanations of cognitive phenomena should incorporate constraints and flows of free energy as relevant components, given that the implemented constraints operate as long as free energy is available. Within this framework, I contend that the FEP provides a relevant constraint for explaining at least some biological cognitive mechanisms described in terms of Bayesian generative models that minimize prediction errors.",

      "abstract": "The free energy principle, and its corollary active inference, constitute a bio-inspired theory that assumes biological agents act to remain in a restricted set of preferred states of the world, i.e., they minimize their free energy. Under this principle, biological agents learn a generative model of the world and plan actions in the future that will maintain the agent in an homeostatic state that satisfies its preferences. This framework lends itself to being realized in silico, as it comprehends important aspects that make it computationally affordable, such as variational inference and amortized planning. In this work, we investigate the tool of deep learning to design and realize artificial agents based on active inference, presenting a deep-learning oriented presentation of the free energy principle, surveying works that are relevant in both machine learning and active inference areas, and discussing the design choices that are involved in the implementation process. This manuscript probes newer perspectives for the active inference framework, grounding its theoretical aspects into more pragmatic affairs, offering a practical guide to active inference newcomers and a starting point for deep learning practitioners that would like to investigate implementations of the free energy principle.",

      "abstract": "Generalized anxiety disorder is among the world’s most prevalent psychiatric disorders and often manifests as persistent and difficult to control apprehension. Despite its prevalence, there is no integrative, formal model of how anxiety and anxiety disorders arise. Here, we offer a perspective derived from the free energy principle; one that shares similarities with established constructs such as learned helplessness. Our account is simple: anxiety can be formalized as learned uncertainty. A biological system, having had persistent uncertainty in its past, will expect uncertainty in its future, irrespective of whether uncertainty truly persists. Despite our account’s intuitive simplicity—which can be illustrated with the mere flip of a coin—it is grounded within the free energy principle and hence situates the formation of anxiety within a broader explanatory framework of biological self-organization and self-evidencing. We conclude that, through conceptualizing anxiety within a framework of working generative models, our perspective might afford novel approaches in the clinical treatment of anxiety and its key symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Biological agents can act in ways that express a sensitivity to context-dependent relevance. So far it has proven difficult to engineer this capacity for context-dependent sensitivity to relevance in artificial agents. We give this problem the label the “problem of meaning”. The problem of meaning could be circumvented if artificial intelligence researchers were to design agents based on the assumption of the continuity of life and mind. In this paper, we focus on the proposal made by enactive cognitive scientists to design artificial agents that possess sensorimotor autonomy—stable, self-sustaining patterns of sensorimotor interaction that can ground values, norms and goals necessary for encountering a meaningful environment. More specifically, we consider whether the Free Energy Principle (FEP) can provide formal tools for modeling sensorimotor autonomy. There is currently no consensus on how to understand the relationship between enactive cognitive science and the FEP. However, a number of recent papers have argued that the two frameworks are fundamentally incompatible. Some argue that biological systems exhibit historical path-dependent learning that is absent from systems that minimize free energy. Others have argued that a free energy minimizing system would fail to satisfy a key condition for sensorimotor agency referred to as “interactional asymmetry”. These critics question the claim we defend in this paper that the FEP can be used to formally model autonomy and adaptivity. We will argue it is too soon to conclude that the two frameworks are incompatible. There are undeniable conceptual differences between the two frameworks but in our view each has something important and necessary to offer. The FEP needs enactive cognitive science for the solution it provides to the problem of meaning. Enactive cognitive science needs the FEP to formally model the properties it argues to be constitutive of agency. Our conclusion will be that active inference models based on the FEP provides a way by which scientists can think about how to address the problems of engineering autonomy and adaptivity in artificial agents in formal terms. In the end engaging more closely with this formalism and its further developments will benefit those working within the enactive framework.",

It does so by considering the boundaries of biological systems, from individual cells to Home sapiens, in terms of the presence of Markov blankets under the active inference scheme—a corollary of the free energy principle. A Markov blanket defines the boundaries of a system in a statistical sense. Here we consider how a collective of Markov blankets can self-assemble into a global system that itself has a Markov blanket; thereby providing an illustration of how autonomous systems can be understood as having layers of nested and self-sustaining boundaries. This allows us to show that: (i) any living system is a Markov blanketed system and (ii) the boundaries of such systems need not be co-extensive with the biophysical boundaries of a living organism. In other words, autonomous systems are hierarchically composed of Markov blankets of Markov blankets—all the way down to individual cells, all the way up to you and me, and all the way out to include elements of the local environment.",

Such hierarchies occur throughout biology, from the architectures of intracellular signal transduction pathways to the large-scale organization of perception and action cycles in the mammalian brain.

      "abstract": "Owing to large industrial energy consumption, industrial production has brought a huge burden to the grid in terms of renewable energy access and power supply. Due to the coupling of multiple energy sources and the uncertainty of renewable energy and demand, centralized methods require large calculation and coordination overhead. Thus, this paper proposes a multi-energy management framework achieved by decentralized execution and centralized training for an industrial park. The energy management problem is formulated as a partially-observable Markov decision process, which is intractable by dynamic programming due to the lack of the prior knowledge of the underlying stochastic process. The objective is to minimize long-term energy costs while ensuring the demand of users. To solve this issue and improve the calculation speed, a novel multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed, which contains the following key points: counterfactual baseline for facilitating contributing agents to learn better policies, soft actor-critic for improving robustness and exploring optimal solutions. A novel reward is designed by Lagrange multiplier method to ensure the capacity constraints of energy storage. In addition, considering that the increase in the number of agents leads to performance degradation due to large observation spaces, an attention mechanism is introduced to enhance the stability of policy and enable agents to focus on important energy-related information, which improves the exploration efficiency of soft actor-critic. Numerical results based on actual data verify the performance of the proposed algorithm with high scalability, indicating that the industrial park can minimize energy costs under different demands.",

Active inference is based on the expected free energy, which is mostly justified by the intuitive plausibility of its formulations, e.g., the risk plus ambiguity and information gain / pragmatic value formulations. This paper seek to formalize the problem of deriving these formulations from a single root expected free energy definition, i.e., the unification problem. Then, we study two settings, each one having its own root expected free energy definition. In the first setting, no justification for the expected free energy has been proposed to date, but all the formulations can be recovered from it. However, in this setting, the agent cannot have arbitrary prior preferences over observations. Indeed, only a limited class of prior preferences over observations is compatible with the likelihood mapping of the generative model. In the second setting, a justification of the root expected free energy definition is known, but this setting only accounts for two formulations, i.e., the risk over states plus ambiguity and entropy plus expected energy formulations.",

      "abstract": "We address the problem of planning under uncertainty, where an agent must choose actions that not only achieve desired outcomes but also reduce uncertainty. Traditional methods often treat exploration and exploitation as separate objectives, lacking a unified inferential foundation. Active inference, grounded in the Free Energy Principle, provides such a foundation by minimizing Expected Free Energy (EFE), a cost function that combines utility with epistemic drives, such as ambiguity resolution and novelty seeking. However, the computational burden of EFE minimization had remained a significant obstacle to its scalability. In this paper, we show that EFE-based planning arises naturally from minimizing a variational free energy functional on a generative model augmented with preference and epistemic priors. This result reinforces theoretical consistency with the Free Energy Principle by casting planning under uncertainty itself as a form of variational inference. Our formulation yields policies that jointly support goal achievement and information gain, while incorporating a complexity term that accounts for bounded computational resources. This unifying framework connects and extends existing methods, enabling scalable, resource-aware implementations of active inference agents.",

      "abstract": "We present a message passing approach to Expected Free Energy (EFE) minimization on factor graphs, based on the theory introduced in arXiv:2504.14898. By reformulating EFE minimization as Variational Free Energy minimization with epistemic priors, we transform a combinatorial search problem into a tractable inference problem solvable through standard variational techniques. Applying our message passing method to factorized state-space models enables efficient policy inference. We evaluate our method on environments with epistemic uncertainty: a stochastic gridworld and a partially observable Minigrid task. Agents using our approach consistently outperform conventional KL-control agents on these tasks, showing more robust planning and efficient exploration under uncertainty. In the stochastic gridworld environment, EFE-minimizing agents avoid risky paths, while in the partially observable minigrid setting, they conduct more systematic information-seeking. This approach bridges active inference theory with practical implementations, providing empirical evidence for the efficiency of epistemic priors in artificial agents.",

      "abstract": "The expected free energy (EFE) is a central quantity in the theory of active inference. It is the quantity that all active inference agents are mandated to minimize through action, and its decomposition into extrinsic and intrinsic value terms is key to the balance of exploration and exploitation that active inference agents evince. Despite its importance, the mathematical origins of this quantity and its relation to the variational free energy (VFE) remain unclear. In this letter, we investigate the origins of the EFE in detail and show that it is not simply ”the free energy in the future.” We present a functional that we argue is the natural extension of the VFE but actively discourages exploratory behavior, thus demonstrating that exploration does not directly follow from free energy minimization into the future. We then develop a novel objective, the free energy of the expected future (FEEF), which possesses both the epistemic component of the EFE and an intuitive mathematical grounding as the divergence between predicted and desired futures.",

      "abstract": "Active Inference (AIF) is a framework that can be used both to describe information processing in naturally intelligent systems, such as the human brain, and to design synthetic intelligent systems (agents). In this paper we show that Expected Free Energy (EFE) minimisation, a core feature of the framework, does not lead to purposeful explorative behaviour in linear Gaussian dynamical systems. We provide a simple proof that, due to the specific construction used for the EFE, the terms responsible for the exploratory (epistemic) drive become constant in the case of linear Gaussian systems. This renders AIF equivalent to KL control. From a theoretical point of view this is an interesting result since it is generally assumed that EFE minimisation will always introduce an exploratory drive in AIF agents. While the full EFE objective does not lead to exploration in linear Gaussian dynamical systems, the principles of its construction can still be used to design objectives that include an epistemic drive. We provide an in-depth analysis of the mechanics behind the epistemic drive of AIF agents and show how to design objectives for linear Gaussian dynamical systems that do include an epistemic drive. Concretely, we show that focusing solely on epistemics and dispensing with goal-directed terms leads to a form of maximum entropy exploration that is heavily dependent on the type of control signals driving the system. Additive controls do not permit such exploration. From a practical point of view this is an important result since linear Gaussian dynamical systems with additive controls are an extensively used model class, encompassing for instance Linear Quadratic Gaussian controllers. On the other hand, linear Gaussian dynamical systems driven by multiplicative controls such as switching transition matrices do permit an exploratory drive.",

      "abstract": "Freud's core interest in the psyche was the dynamic unconscious: that part of the psyche which is unconscious due to conflict (Freud, 1923/1961). Over the course of his career, Freud variously described conflict as an opposition to the discharge of activation (Freud, 1950), opposition to psychic activity due to the release of unpleasure (Freud, 1990/1991), opposition between the primary principle and the reality principle (Freud, 1911/1963), structural conflict between id, ego, and superego (Freud, 1923/1961), and ambivalence (Freud, 1912/1963). Besides this difficulty of the shifting description of conflict, an underlying question remained the specific shared terrain in which emotions, thoughts, intentions or wishes could come into conflict with one another (the neuronal homolog of conflict), and most especially how they may exist as quantities in opposition within that terrain. Friston's free-energy principle (FEP henceforth) connected to the work of Friston (Friston et al., 2006; Friston, 2010) has provided the potential for a powerful unifying theory in psychology, neuroscience, and related fields that has been shown to have tremendous consilience with psychoanalytic concepts (Hopkins, 2012). Hopkins (2016), drawing on a formulation by Hobson et al. (2014), suggests that conflict may be potentially quantifiable as free energy from a FEP perspective. More recently, work by Friston et al. (2017a) has framed the selection of action as a gradient descent of expected free energy under different policies of action. From this perspective, the article describes how conflict could potentially be formalized as a situation where opposing action policies have similar expected free energy, for example between actions driven by competing basic prototype emotion systems as described by Panksepp (1998). This conflict state may be avoided in the future through updating the relative precision of a particular set of prior beliefs about outcomes: this has the result of tending to favor one of the policies of action over others in future instances, a situation analogous to defense. Through acting as a constraint on the further development of the person, the defensive operation can become entrenched, and resistant to alteration. The implications that this formalization has for psychoanalysis is explored.",

However, the Buckets effect of runaway phase transition and irreversible dissolution restricts the electrochemical performance of MnO2. To address this issue, this report presents a bottom‐up targeted assembly concept driven by Gibbs free energy for the design of a robust Ni‐MnO2‐xFx host via Ni2+ pre‐intercalation coupled with fluorine doping. The Gibbs free energy of the host is regulated by the coordination of interlayer reinforcement and interfacial defect repair, which prevents the “layer‐to‐spinel” transition and inhibits dissolution during long‐term cycling. As expected, this cathode provides superior H+/Zn2+ storage performance across a wide temperature range. A capacity of 180.4 mAh g−1 is retained after 1000 cycles at 2 A g−1, a high specific capacity of 293.9 mAh g−1 is retained after 250 cycles at 50 °C and 2 A g−1, and a capacity of 144.5 mAh g−1 is retained after 3000 cycles at 0 °C and 0.5 A g−1.

However, in affective science, emotions are often represented as multi-dimensional. In this paper, we propose to adopt a Circumplex Model of emotion by mapping emotions into a two-dimensional spectrum of valence and arousal. We show how one can derive a valence and arousal signal from an agent's expected free energy, relating arousal to the entropy of posterior beliefs and valence to utility less expected utility. Under this formulation, we simulate artificial agents engaged in a search task. We show that the manipulation of priors and object presence results in commonsense variability in emotional states.",

Thermodynamics integration (TI) based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is a BFE calculation method capable of acquiring accurate BFE, but it is computationally expensive and time-consuming. In this work, we have developed an efficient automated workflow for identifying compounds with the lowest BFE among thousands of congeneric ligands, which requires only hundreds of TI calculations. Automated machine learning (AutoML) orchestrated by active learning (AL) in an AL-AutoML workflow allows unbiased and efficient search for a small set of best-performing molecules. We have applied this workflow to select inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease and were able to find 133 compounds with improved binding affinity, including 16 compounds with better than 100-fold binding affinity improvement. We obtained a hit rate that outperforms that expected of traditional expert medicinal chemist-guided campaigns. Thus, we demonstrate that the combination of AL and AutoML with free energy simulations provides at least 20× speedup relative to the naïve brute force approaches.",

In these cases, the robot first needs to actively query multiple observations and accumulate information before it can complete a task. In this paper, we cast this problem of active vision as active inference, which states that an intelligent agent maintains a generative model of its environment and acts in order to minimize its surprise, or expected free energy according to this model. We apply this to an object-reaching task for a 7-DOF robotic manipulator with an in-hand camera to scan the workspace. A novel generative model using deep neural networks is proposed that is able to fuse multiple views into an abstract representation and is trained from data by minimizing variational free energy. We validate our approach experimentally for a reaching task in simulation in which a robotic agent starts without any knowledge about its workspace. Each step, the next view pose is chosen by evaluating the expected free energy. We find that by minimizing the expected free energy, exploratory behavior emerges when the target object to reach is not in view, and the end effector is moved to the correct reach position once the target is located. Similar to an owl scavenging for prey, the robot naturally prefers higher ground for exploring, approaching its target once located.",

We demonstrate that consistent free energy results are obtained in both the gas phase and in solution. We first show, in the context of thermodynamic integration (TI), that results are invariant with respect to \"split\" (e.g., stepwise decharge-vdW-recharge) versus \"unified\" protocols. This brought to light a subtle inconsistency in previous versions of AMBER that was traced to the improper treatment of 1-4 vdW and electrostatic interactions involving atoms across the softcore boundary. We illustrate that, under the assumption that the ensembles produced by different legs of the alchemical transformation between molecules \"A\" and \"B\" in the gas phase and aqueous phase are very small, the inconsistency on the relative hydration free energy ΔΔGhydr[A → B] = ΔG(aq)[A → B] - △G(gas)[A → B] is minimal. However, for general cases where the ensembles are shown to be substantially different, as expected in ligand-protein binding applications, these errors can be large. Finally, we demonstrate that results for relative hydration free energy simulations are independent of TI or multistate Bennett's acceptance ratio (MBAR) analysis, invariant to the specific choice of the softcore region, and agree with results derived from absolute hydration free energy values.",

This mechanism is then formalized in terms of free energy minimization (in unpredicted contexts) where decreases and increases in expected uncertainty are felt as pleasure and unpleasure, respectively. Emphasis is placed on the reasons why such existential imperatives feel like something to and for an organism.",

      "abstract": "Active inference is an approach to understanding behaviour that rests upon the idea that the brain uses an internal generative model to predict incoming sensory data. The fit between this model and data may be improved in two ways. The brain could optimise probabilistic beliefs about the variables in the generative model (i.e. perceptual inference). Alternatively, by acting on the world, it could change the sensory data, such that they are more consistent with the model. This implies a common objective function (variational free energy) for action and perception that scores the fit between an internal model and the world. We compare two free energy functionals for active inference in the framework of Markov decision processes. One of these is a functional of beliefs (i.e. probability distributions) about states and policies, but a function of observations, while the second is a functional of beliefs about all three. In the former (expected free energy), prior beliefs about outcomes are not part of the generative model (because they are absorbed into the prior over policies). Conversely, in the second (generalised free energy), priors over outcomes become an explicit component of the generative model. When using the free energy function, which is blind to future observations, we equip the generative model with a prior over policies that ensure preferred (i.e. priors over) outcomes are realised. In other words, if we expect to encounter a particular kind of outcome, this lends plausibility to those policies for which this outcome is a consequence. In addition, this formulation ensures that selected policies minimise uncertainty about future outcomes by minimising the free energy expected in the future. When using the free energy functional—that effectively treats future observations as hidden states—we show that policies are inferred or selected that realise prior preferences by minimising the free energy of future expectations. Interestingly, the form of posterior beliefs about policies (and associated belief updating) turns out to be identical under both formulations, but the quantities used to compute them are not.",

      "abstract": "Renewed interest in the homogeneous electron gas (HEG) has been stimulated by recent accurate simulations of it over a wide range of densities and temperatures. Those data, combined with known theoretical limits, have led to analytical representations of the free energy. Such a representation is, at least in principle, the complete HEG equation of state. The initial objective here is to establish that the two best representations [“corrKSDT,” Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 076403 (2014), Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 076401 (2018), and “GDB” Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 135001 (2017)] of the simulation data and constraints are effectively the same in both functional form and accuracy of representation. The second objective is to disclose and delineate a significant difficulty. Despite their expected accuracy for the free energy, the underlying functional form is not adequate for derived thermodynamic properties. As an example, the specific heats obtained from the representations exhibit anomalies suggesting the need first for additional simulation data in critical regimes, then for refined fitting functions. The existing representations are, however, almost certainly adequate for applications based on the free energy alone (e.g., density-functional theory for warm dense matter). The third objective is to show that, despite their inability to provide a complete thermodynamic description of the HEG, the best analytical representations do provide a fully adequate exchange-correlation local density approximation for free-energy density-functional calculations.",

In contrast to previous studies of mono- and bivalent ions in organic solvents, mainly performed using hybrid cluster-continuum quantum chemistry calculations that rely on the assumption of uniqueness of ion solvation free energies, here we find that monoatomic bivalent cations may have multiple well-defined minima, as previously reported only for water, or plateaus of free energy with respect to the ion-solvent coordination. These observations are generalized in the concept of the ``ion solvation spectrum`` to highlight the rich phenomenology related to ion solvation as opposed to the normally expected free energy profiles with a single coordination minimum. Specifically, we show that a single chemical species may exhibit a multiplicity of distinctly different electrochemical properties. Using one- and two-dimensional projections of the free energy landscape, we analyze the stability of ion solvation structures and reveal minimum free energy pathways for ion (de-)solvation with low-dimensional approximations to associated kinetic barriers. Unexpectedly, we show that in some cases the process of opening the first ion solvation shell, by removing a solvent molecule, may actually drive the ion into a free-energy basin with a higher coordination number. Our study highlights some deficiencies of conventional methodologies for studying ion solvation as a path to determine redox potentials and provides experimentally testable predictions.",

For a specific choice of the couplings mean, the resulting Gibbs measure is equivalent to the Bayesian posterior for a high-dimensional estimation problem known as `$Z_2$ synchronization'. Statistical physics suggests to compute the expectation with respect to this Gibbs measure (the posterior mean in the synchronization problem), by minimizing the so-called Thouless-Anderson-Palmer (TAP) free energy, instead of the mean field (MF) free energy. We prove that this identification is correct, provided the ferromagnetic bias is larger than a constant (i.e. the noise level is small enough in synchronization). Namely, we prove that the scaled $\\ell_2$ distance between any low energy local minimizers of the TAP free energy and the mean of the Gibbs measure vanishes in the large size limit. Our proof technique is based on upper bounding the expected number of critical points of the TAP free energy using the Kac-Rice formula.",

Indeed, massive devices with limited energy storage capacity impose persistent energy demand hindering the lifetime of communication networks. As a remedy, wireless energy transfer (WET) is a key technology to address these critical energy supply issues. On the other hand, cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems offer an efficient network architecture to realize the rollout of IoE. In this article, we first propose the paradigm of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided CF massive MIMO systems for WET, including its potential application scenarios and system architecture. The four-stage transmission procedure is discussed and analyzed to illustrate the practicality of the architecture. Then we put forward and analyze the hardware design of RIS. In particular, we discuss the three corresponding operating modes and the amalgamation of WET technology and RIS-aided CF massive MIMO. Representative simulation results are given to confirm the superior performance achieved by our proposed schemes. Also, we investigate the optimal location of deploying multiple RISs to achieve the best system performance. Finally, several important research directions of RIS-aided CF massive MIMO systems with WET are presented to inspire further potential investigation.",

In particular, changes in data sources are inevitable to occur and pose significant risks that are crucial to address in the context of machine learning for official statistics.   This paper gives an overview of the main risks, liabilities, and uncertainties associated with changing data sources in the context of machine learning for official statistics. We provide a checklist of the most prevalent origins and causes of changing data sources; not only on a technical level but also regarding ownership, ethics, regulation, and public perception. Next, we highlight the repercussions of changing data sources on statistical reporting. These include technical effects such as concept drift, bias, availability, validity, accuracy and completeness, but also the neutrality and potential discontinuation of the statistical offering. We offer a few important precautionary measures, such as enhancing robustness in both data sourcing and statistical techniques, and thorough monitoring.

Learning curves have important applications in several machine learning contexts, most notably in data acquisition, early stopping of model training, and model selection. For instance, learning curves can be used to model the performance of the combination of an algorithm and its hyperparameter configuration, providing insights into their potential suitability at an early stage and often expediting the algorithm selection process. Various learning curve models have been proposed to use learning curves for decision making. Some of these models answer the binary decision question of whether a given algorithm at a certain budget will outperform a certain reference performance, whereas more complex models predict the entire learning curve of an algorithm. We contribute a framework that categorises learning curve approaches using three criteria: the decision-making situation they address, the intrinsic learning curve question they answer and the type of resources they use. We survey papers from the literature and classify them into this framework.",

      "abstract": "Online active learning is a paradigm in machine learning that aims to select the most informative data points to label from a data stream. The problem of minimizing the cost associated with collecting labeled observations has gained a lot of attention in recent years, particularly in real-world applications where data is only available in an unlabeled form. Annotating each observation can be time-consuming and costly, making it difficult to obtain large amounts of labeled data. To overcome this issue, many active learning strategies have been proposed in the last decades, aiming to select the most informative observations for labeling in order to improve the performance of machine learning models. These approaches can be broadly divided into two categories: static pool-based and stream-based active learning. Pool-based active learning involves selecting a subset of observations from a closed pool of unlabeled data, and it has been the focus of many surveys and literature reviews. However, the growing availability of data streams has led to an increase in the number of approaches that focus on online active learning, which involves continuously selecting and labeling observations as they arrive in a stream. This work aims to provide an overview of the most recently proposed approaches for selecting the most informative observations from data streams in real time. We review the various techniques that have been proposed and discuss their strengths and limitations, as well as the challenges and opportunities that exist in this area of research.",

Great interest exists in understanding which features of the input data prompt model decision making. In this contribution, we propose a novel approach to identify relevant features of the input data, inspired by methods from the energy landscapes field, developed in the physical sciences. By identifying conserved weights within groups of minima of the loss landscapes, we can identify the drivers of model decision making. Analogues to this idea exist in the molecular sciences, where coordinate invariants or order parameters are employed to identify critical features of a molecule. However, no such approach exists for machine learning loss landscapes. We will demonstrate the applicability of energy landscape methods to machine learning models and give examples, both synthetic and from the real world, for how these methods can help to make models more interpretable.",

Due to the sensitive nature of medical data, privacy must be considered along the entire ML pipeline, from model training to inference. In this paper, we conduct a review of recent literature concerning Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning (PPML) for healthcare. We primarily focus on privacy-preserving training and inference-as-a-service, and perform a comprehensive review of existing trends, identify challenges, and discuss opportunities for future research directions.

      "abstract": "The proliferation of fake news and its propagation on social media has become a major concern due to its ability to create devastating impacts. Different machine learning approaches have been suggested to detect fake news. However, most of those focused on a specific type of news (such as political) which leads us to the question of dataset-bias of the models used. In this research, we conducted a benchmark study to assess the performance of different applicable machine learning approaches on three different datasets where we accumulated the largest and most diversified one. We explored a number of advanced pre-trained language models for fake news detection along with the traditional and deep learning ones and compared their performances from different aspects for the first time to the best of our knowledge. We find that BERT and similar pre-trained models perform the best for fake news detection, especially with very small dataset. Hence, these models are significantly better option for languages with limited electronic contents, i.e., training data. We also carried out several analysis based on the models' performance, article's topic, article's length, and discussed different lessons learned from them. We believe that this benchmark study will help the research community to explore further and news sites/blogs to select the most appropriate fake news detection method.",

      "abstract": "This article provides the first survey of computational models of emotion in reinforcement learning (RL) agents. The survey focuses on agent/robot emotions, and mostly ignores human user emotions. Emotions are recognized as functional in decision-making by influencing motivation and action selection. Therefore, computational emotion models are usually grounded in the agent's decision making architecture, of which RL is an important subclass. Studying emotions in RL-based agents is useful for three research fields. For machine learning (ML) researchers, emotion models may improve learning efficiency. For the interactive ML and human-robot interaction (HRI) community, emotions can communicate state and enhance user investment. Lastly, it allows affective modelling (AM) researchers to investigate their emotion theories in a successful AI agent class. This survey provides background on emotion theory and RL. It systematically addresses 1) from what underlying dimensions (e.g., homeostasis, appraisal) emotions can be derived and how these can be modelled in RL-agents, 2) what types of emotions have been derived from these dimensions, and 3) how these emotions may either influence the learning efficiency of the agent or be useful as social signals. We also systematically compare evaluation criteria, and draw connections to important RL sub-domains like (intrinsic) motivation and model-based RL. In short, this survey provides both a practical overview for engineers wanting to implement emotions in their RL agents, and identifies challenges and directions for future emotion-RL research.",

We introduce a comprehensive framework that synergizes the granularity of rough set theory with the uncertainty quantification of Shannon entropy, applied across a spectrum of machine learning algorithms. Our methodology is rigorously tested on various datasets, showcasing its capability to not only assess predictive performance but also to illuminate the underlying data complexity and model robustness. The results underscore the utility of this integrated approach in enhancing the evaluation landscape of machine learning, offering a multi-faceted perspective that balances accuracy with a profound understanding of data attributes and model dynamics.

These embeddings are then processed by a transformer model trained for object and gesture recognition.

The commonly used Minimax distance measures correspond to building a dendrogram with single linkage criterion, with defining specific forms of a level function and a distance function over that. Therefore, we extend this method to arbitrary dendrograms. We develop a generalized framework wherein different distance measures and representations can be inferred from different types of dendrograms, level functions and distance functions. Via an appropriate embedding, we compute a vector-based representation of the inferred distances, in order to enable many numerical machine learning algorithms to employ such distances. Then, to address the model selection problem, we study the aggregation of different dendrogram-based distances respectively in solution space and in representation space in the spirit of deep representations. In the first approach, for example for the clustering problem, we build a graph with positive and negative edge weights according to the consistency of the clustering labels of different objects among different solutions, in the context of ensemble methods. Then, we use an efficient variant of correlation clustering to produce the final clusters. In the second approach, we investigate the combination of different distances and features sequentially in the spirit of multi-layered architectures to obtain the final features. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach via several numerical studies.",

AI methods are allowing economists to solve such prediction problems in new ways. In this manuscript, we present novel methods that predict and associate food and agricultural commodities traded internationally. Association Rules (AR) analysis has been deployed successfully for economic scenarios at the consumer or store level, such as for market basket analysis. In our work however, we present analysis of imports and exports associations and their effects on commodity trade flows.

We develop a general-purpose and computationally efficient framework to employ Minimax distances with many machine learning methods that perform on numerical data. We study both computing the pairwise Minimax distances for all pairs of objects and as well as computing the Minimax distances of all the objects to/from a fixed (test) object. We first efficiently compute the pairwise Minimax distances between the objects, using the equivalence of Minimax distances over a graph and over a minimum spanning tree constructed on that. Then, we perform an embedding of the pairwise Minimax distances into a new vector space, such that their squared Euclidean distances in the new space equal to the pairwise Minimax distances in the original space. We also study the case of having multiple pairwise Minimax matrices, instead of a single one. Thereby, we propose an embedding via first summing up the centered matrices and then performing an eigenvalue decomposition to obtain the relevant features. In the following, we study computing Minimax distances from a fixed (test) object which can be used for instance in K-nearest neighbor search. Similar to the case of all-pair pairwise Minimax distances, we develop an efficient and general-purpose algorithm that is applicable with any arbitrary base distance measure. Moreover, we investigate in detail the edges selected by the Minimax distances and thereby explore the ability of Minimax distances in detecting outlier objects.

      "abstract": "From medical charts to national census, healthcare has traditionally operated under a paper-based paradigm. However, the past decade has marked a long and arduous transformation bringing healthcare into the digital age. Ranging from electronic health records, to digitized imaging and laboratory reports, to public health datasets, today, healthcare now generates an incredible amount of digital information. Such a wealth of data presents an exciting opportunity for integrated machine learning solutions to address problems across multiple facets of healthcare practice and administration. Unfortunately, the ability to derive accurate and informative insights requires more than the ability to execute machine learning models. Rather, a deeper understanding of the data on which the models are run is imperative for their success. While a significant effort has been undertaken to develop models able to process the volume of data obtained during the analysis of millions of digitalized patient records, it is important to remember that volume represents only one aspect of the data. In fact, drawing on data from an increasingly diverse set of sources, healthcare data presents an incredibly complex set of attributes that must be accounted for throughout the machine learning pipeline. This chapter focuses on highlighting such challenges, and is broken down into three distinct components, each representing a phase of the pipeline. We begin with attributes of the data accounted for during preprocessing, then move to considerations during model building, and end with challenges to the interpretation of model output. For each component, we present a discussion around data as it relates to the healthcare domain and offer insight into the challenges each may impose on the efficiency of machine learning techniques.",

      "abstract": "The topic of comprehensibility of machine-learned theories has recently drawn increasing attention. Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) uses logic programming to derive logic theories from small data based on abduction and induction techniques. Learned theories are represented in the form of rules as declarative descriptions of obtained knowledge. In earlier work, the authors provided the first evidence of a measurable increase in human comprehension based on machine-learned logic rules for simple classification tasks. In a later study, it was found that the presentation of machine-learned explanations to humans can produce both beneficial and harmful effects in the context of game learning. We continue our investigation of comprehensibility by examining the effects of the ordering of concept presentations on human comprehension. In this work, we examine the explanatory effects of curriculum order and the presence of machine-learned explanations for sequential problem-solving. We show that 1) there exist tasks A and B such that learning A before B has a better human comprehension with respect to learning B before A and 2) there exist tasks A and B such that the presence of explanations when learning A contributes to improved human comprehension when subsequently learning B. We propose a framework for the effects of sequential teaching on comprehension based on an existing definition of comprehensibility and provide evidence for support from data collected in human trials. Empirical results show that sequential teaching of concepts with increasing complexity a) has a beneficial effect on human comprehension and b) leads to human re-discovery of divide-and-conquer problem-solving strategies, and c) studying machine-learned explanations allows adaptations of human problem-solving strategy with better performance.",

      "abstract": "Machine learning algorithms designed to characterize, monitor, and intervene on human health (ML4H) are expected to perform safely and reliably when operating at scale, potentially outside strict human supervision. This requirement warrants a stricter attention to issues of reproducibility than other fields of machine learning.   In this work, we conduct a systematic evaluation of over 100 recently published ML4H research papers along several dimensions related to reproducibility. We find that the field of ML4H compares poorly to more established machine learning fields, particularly concerning data and code accessibility. Finally, drawing from success in other fields of science, we propose recommendations to data providers, academic publishers, and the ML4H research community in order to promote reproducible research moving forward.",

However, the unique characteristics of these data are not always well suited to machine learning techniques. These data are often generated across different technologies in different labs, and frequently with high dimensionality. In this paper we present a framework for combining -omics data sets, and for handling high dimensional data, making -omics research more accessible to machine learning applications. We demonstrate the success of this framework through integration and analysis of multi-analyte data for a set of 3,533 breast cancers. We then use this data-set to predict breast cancer patient survival for individuals at risk of an impending event, with higher accuracy and lower variance than methods trained on individual data-sets. We hope that our pipelines for data-set generation and transformation will open up -omics data to machine learning researchers.

People have hoped that creating methods for explaining these black box models will alleviate some of these problems, but trying to \\textit{explain} black box models, rather than creating models that are \\textit{interpretable} in the first place, is likely to perpetuate bad practices and can potentially cause catastrophic harm to society. There is a way forward -- it is to design models that are inherently interpretable. This manuscript clarifies the chasm between explaining black boxes and using inherently interpretable models, outlines several key reasons why explainable black boxes should be avoided in high-stakes decisions, identifies challenges to interpretable machine learning, and provides several example applications where interpretable models could potentially replace black box models in criminal justice, healthcare, and computer vision.",

At the same time, for every episode, features in the embedding space are linearly projected into a new space as a form of quick task-specific conditioning. The training loss is obtained based on a distance metric between the query and the reference vectors in the projection space. Excellent generalization results in this way. When tested on the Omniglot, miniImageNet and tieredImageNet datasets, we obtain state of the art classification accuracies under various few-shot scenarios.",

The graph-based representation reflects how designers reason about and visualise algorithms, and allows automatic parallelism and asynchronicity. A strong, static type system and higher-order semantics allow for high expressivity and compositionality in the program. The flexible runtime protocol enables third-party developers to add functionality using any language or environment.

      "abstract": "The determination of ground state properties of quantum systems is a fundamental problem in physics and chemistry, and is considered a key application of quantum computers. A common approach is to prepare a trial ground state on the quantum computer and measure observables such as energy, but this is often limited by hardware constraints that prevent an accurate description of the target ground state. The quantum computed moments (QCM) method has proven to be remarkably useful in estimating the ground state energy of a system by computing Hamiltonian moments with respect to a suboptimal or noisy trial state. In this paper, we extend the QCM method to estimate arbitrary ground state observables of quantum systems. We present preliminary results of using QCM to determine the ground state magnetisation and spin-spin correlations of the Heisenberg model in its various forms. Our findings validate the well-established advantage of QCM over existing methods in handling suboptimal trial states and noise, extend its applicability to the estimation of more general ground state properties, and demonstrate its practical potential for solving a wide range of problems on near-term quantum hardware.",

Following Shor's result that factoring and the extraction of discrete logarithms are both solvable in quantum polynomial time, it is natural to ask whether all of NP can be efficiently solved in quantum polynomial time. In this paper, we address this question by proving that relative to an oracle chosen uniformly at random, with probability 1, the class NP cannot be solved on a quantum Turing machine in time $o(2^{n/2})$. We also show that relative to a permutation oracle chosen uniformly at random, with probability 1, the class $NP \\cap coNP$ cannot be solved on a quantum Turing machine in time $o(2^{n/3})$. The former bound is tight since recent work of Grover shows how to accept the class NP relative to any oracle on a quantum computer in time $O(2^{n/2})$.",

      "abstract": "Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) technology will be available in the near future. Quantum computers with 50-100 qubits may be able to perform tasks which surpass the capabilities of today's classical digital computers, but noise in quantum gates will limit the size of quantum circuits that can be executed reliably. NISQ devices will be useful tools for exploring many-body quantum physics, and may have other useful applications, but the 100-qubit quantum computer will not change the world right away --- we should regard it as a significant step toward the more powerful quantum technologies of the future. Quantum technologists should continue to strive for more accurate quantum gates and, eventually, fully fault-tolerant quantum computing.",

      "abstract": "As quantum computers become available to the general public, the need has arisen to train a cohort of quantum programmers, many of whom have been developing classical computer programs for most of their careers. While currently available quantum computers have less than 100 qubits, quantum computing hardware is widely expected to grow in terms of qubit count, quality, and connectivity. This review aims to explain the principles of quantum programming, which are quite different from classical programming, with straightforward algebra that makes understanding of the underlying fascinating quantum mechanical principles optional. We give an introduction to quantum computing algorithms and their implementation on real quantum hardware. We survey 20 different quantum algorithms, attempting to describe each in a succinct and self-contained fashion. We show how these algorithms can be implemented on IBM's quantum computer, and in each case, we discuss the results of the implementation with respect to differences between the simulator and the actual hardware runs. This article introduces computer scientists, physicists, and engineers to quantum algorithms and provides a blueprint for their implementations.",

      "abstract": "Leveraging quantum computers for optimization problems holds promise across various application domains. Nevertheless, utilizing respective quantum computing solvers requires describing the optimization problem according to the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formalism and selecting a proper solver for the application of interest with a reasonable setting. Both demand significant proficiency in quantum computing, QUBO formulation, and quantum solvers, a background that usually cannot be assumed by end users who are domain experts rather than quantum computing specialists. While tools aid in QUBO formulations, support for selecting the best-solving approach remains absent. This becomes even more challenging because selecting the best solver for a problem heavily depends on the problem itself. In this work, we are accepting this challenge and propose a predictive selection approach, which aids end users in this task. To this end, the solver selection task is first formulated as a classification task that is suitable to be solved by supervised machine learning. Based on that, we then propose strategies for adjusting solver parameters based on problem size and characteristics. Experimental evaluations, considering more than 500 different QUBO problems, confirm the benefits of the proposed solution. In fact, we show that in more than 70% of the cases, the best solver is selected, and in about 90% of the problems, a solver in the top two, i.e., the best or its closest suboptimum, is selected. This exploration proves the potential of machine learning in quantum solver selection and lays the foundations for its automation, broadening access to quantum optimization for a wider range of users.",

      "abstract": "Non-linearity of a Boolean function indicates how far it is from any linear function. Despite there being several strong results about identifying a linear function and distinguishing one from a sufficiently non-linear function, we found a surprising lack of work on computing the non-linearity of a function. The non-linearity is related to the Walsh coefficient with the largest absolute value; however, the naive attempt of picking the maximum after constructing a Walsh spectrum requires $Θ(2^n)$ queries to an $n$-bit function. We improve the scenario by designing highly efficient quantum and randomised algorithms to approximate the non-linearity allowing additive error, denoted $λ$, with query complexities that depend polynomially on $λ$. We prove lower bounds to show that these are not very far from the optimal ones. The number of queries made by our randomised algorithm is linear in $n$, already an exponential improvement, and the number of queries made by our quantum algorithm is surprisingly independent of $n$. Our randomised algorithm uses a Goldreich-Levin style of navigating all Walsh coefficients and our quantum algorithm uses a clever combination of Deutsch-Jozsa, amplitude amplification and amplitude estimation to improve upon the existing quantum versions of the Goldreich-Levin technique.",

We show the potential enhancement induced by dissipation in the field of quantum reservoir computing introducing tunable local losses in spin network models. Our approach based on continuous dissipation is able not only to reproduce the dynamics of previous proposals of quantum reservoir computing, based on discontinuous erasing maps but also to enhance their performance. Control of the damping rates is shown to boost popular machine learning temporal tasks as the capability to linearly and non-linearly process the input history and to forecast chaotic series. Finally, we formally prove that, under non-restrictive conditions, our dissipative models form a universal class for reservoir computing.

      "abstract": "Humans routinely solve problems of immense computational complexity by intuitively forming simple, low-dimensional heuristic strategies. Citizen science exploits this ability by presenting scientific research problems to non-experts. Gamification is an effective tool for attracting citizen scientists to provide solutions to research problems. While citizen science games Foldit, EteRNA and EyeWire have been used successfully to study protein and RNA folding and neuron mapping, so far gamification has not been applied to problems in quantum physics. Does the fact that everyday experiences are based on classical physics hinder the use of non-expert citizen scientists in the realm of quantum mechanics? Here we report on Quantum Moves, an online platform gamifying optimization problems in quantum physics. We show that human players are able to find solutions to difficult problems associated with the task of quantum computing. Players succeed where purely numerical optimization fails, and analyses of their solutions provide insights into the problem of optimization of a more profound and general nature. Based on player strategies, we have thus developed a new, few-parameter heuristic optimization method which efficiently outperforms the most prominent established numerical methods. The numerical complexity associated with time-optimal solutions increases for shorter process durations. To better understand this, we have made a low-dimensional rendering of the optimization landscape. These studies show why traditional optimization methods fail near the quantum speed limit, and they bring promise that combined analyses of optimization landscapes and heuristic solution strategies may benefit wider classes of optimization problems in quantum physics and beyond.",

      "abstract": "Proposals for solid state quantum computing are extremely promising as they can be used to built room temperature quantum computers. If such a quantum computer is ever built it would require in-built sources of nonclassical states required for various quantum information processing tasks. Possibilities of generation of such nonclassical states are investigated here for a physical system composed of a monochromatic light coupled to a two-band semiconductor with direct band gap. The model Hamiltonian includes both photon-exciton and exciton-exciton interactions. Time evolution of the relevant bosonic operators are obtained analytically by using a perturbative technique that provides operator solution for the coupled Heisenberg's equations of motion corresponding to the system Hamiltonian. The bosonic operators are subsequently used to study the possibilities of observing single and two mode squeezing and antibunching after interaction in the relevant modes of light and semiconductor. Further, entanglement between the exciton and photon modes is reported. Finally, the nonclassical effects have been studied numerically for the open quantum system scenario. In this situation, the nonlocal correlations between two modes are shown to violate EPR steering inequality. The observed nonclassical features, induced due to exciton-exciton pair interaction, can be controlled by the phase of input field and the correlations between two modes are shown to enhance due to nonclassicality in the input field.",

The physical motivation is that we can do these measurements in a way that is protected against revealing other information so long as all terms in the Hamiltonian are $SU(2)$-invariant. We conjecture that this model is equivalent to BQP. Towards this goal, we show: (1) this model is capable of universal quantum computation with polylogarithmic overhead if it is supplemented by single qubit $X$ and $Z$ gates. (2) Without any additional gates, it is at least as powerful as the weak model of \"permutational quantum computation\" of Jordan [14, 18].

We argue that this holomorphic representation is a natural one which not only gives a canonical description of bosonic quantum computing using basic elements of complex analysis but also provides a unifying picture which delineates the boundary between discrete- and continuous-variable quantum information theory. Using this representation, we show that the evolution of a single bosonic mode under a Gaussian Hamiltonian can be described as an integrable dynamical system of classical Calogero-Moser particles corresponding to the zeros of the holomorphic function, together with a conformal evolution of Gaussian parameters. We explain that the Calogero-Moser dynamics is due to unique features of bosonic Hilbert spaces such as squeezing. We then generalize the properties of this holomorphic representation to the multimode case, deriving a non-Gaussian hierarchy of quantum states and relating entanglement to factorization properties of holomorphic functions. Finally, we apply this formalism to discrete- and continuous- variable quantum measurements and obtain a classification of subuniversal models that are generalizations of Boson Sampling and Gaussian quantum computing.",

In these systems, it is possible to encode qubits in nuclear spin states, which are decoupled from the electronic state in the $^1$S$_0$ ground state and the long-lived $^3$P$_0$ metastable state on the clock transition. This leads to quantum computing scenarios where qubits are stored in long lived nuclear spin states, while electronic states can be accessed independently, for cooling of the atoms, as well as manipulation and readout of the qubits. The high nuclear spin in some fermionic isotopes also offers opportunities for the encoding of multiple qubits on a single atom, as well as providing an opportunity for studying many-body physics in systems with a high spin symmetry. Here we review recent experimental and theoretical progress in these areas, and summarise the advantages and challenges for quantum computing and quantum simulation with group-II atoms.",

      "abstract": "Quantum computing promises to offer substantial speed-ups over its classical counterpart for certain problems. However, the greatest impediment to realizing its full potential is noise that is inherent to these systems. The widely accepted solution to this challenge is the implementation of fault-tolerant quantum circuits, which is out of reach for current processors. Here we report experiments on a noisy 127-qubit processor and demonstrate the measurement of accurate expectation values for circuit volumes at a scale beyond brute-force classical computation. We argue that this represents evidence for the utility of quantum computing in a pre-fault-tolerant era. These experimental results are enabled by advances in the coherence and calibration of a superconducting processor at this scale and the ability to characterize^ 1 and controllably manipulate noise across such a large device. We establish the accuracy of the measured expectation values by comparing them with the output of exactly verifiable circuits. In the regime of strong entanglement, the quantum computer provides correct results for which leading classical approximations such as pure-state-based 1D (matrix product states, MPS) and 2D (isometric tensor network states, isoTNS) tensor network methods^ 2 , 3 break down. These experiments demonstrate a foundational tool for the realization of near-term quantum applications^ 4 , 5 .

      "abstract": "Variational quantum computing offers a flexible computational approach with a broad range of applications. However, a key obstacle to realizing their potential is the barren plateau (BP) phenomenon. When a model exhibits a BP, its parameter optimization landscape becomes exponentially flat and featureless as the problem size increases. Importantly, all the moving pieces of an algorithm — choices of ansatz, initial state, observable, loss function and hardware noise — can lead to BPs if they are ill-suited. As BPs strongly impact on trainability, researchers have dedicated considerable effort to develop theoretical and heuristic methods to understand and mitigate their effects. As a result, the study of BPs has become a thriving area of research, influencing and exchanging ideas with other fields such as quantum optimal control, tensor networks and learning theory. This article provides a review of the current understanding of the BP phenomenon. Barren plateaus are widely considered as one of the main limitations for variational quantum algorithms. This Review summarizes the latest understandings of barren plateaus, indicating its causes, architecture that will suffer from this phenomenon, and discusses strategies that can — and cannot — avoid it. Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) — this hybrid computational approach aims at training a quantum learning model (usually a parametrized quantum circuit) to solve a given task. The parameters in the model are trained by minimizing a loss function that encodes the degree to which the problem has been solved. Barren plateaus — a phenomenon in which the gradients of the loss landscape of VQAs get exponentially suppressed. Currently, this issue is understood as a form of curse of dimensionality arising from operating in an unstructured manner in an exponentially large Hilbert space.

Among the promising technological approaches, photonic quantum computing offers the advantages of low decoherence, information processing with modest cryogenic requirements, and native integration with classical and quantum networks. So far, quantum computing demonstrations with light have implemented specific tasks with specialized hardware, notably Gaussian boson sampling, which permits the quantum computational advantage to be realized. Here we report a cloud-accessible versatile quantum computing prototype based on single photons. The device comprises a high-efficiency quantum-dot single-photon source feeding a universal linear optical network on a reconfigurable chip for which hardware errors are compensated by a machine-learned transpilation process. Our full software stack allows remote control of the device to perform computations via logic gates or direct photonic operations. For gate-based computation, we benchmark one-, two- and three-qubit gates with state-of-the art fidelities of 99.6 ± 0.1%, 93.8 ± 0.6% and 86 ± 1.2%, respectively. We also implement a variational quantum eigensolver, which we use to calculate the energy levels of the hydrogen molecule with chemical accuracy. For photon native computation, we implement a classifier algorithm using a three-photon-based quantum neural network and report a six-photon boson sampling demonstration on a universal reconfigurable integrated circuit. Finally, we report on a heralded three-photon entanglement generation, a key milestone toward measurement-based quantum computing. A versatile cloud-accessible single-photon-based quantum computing machine is developed, which shows a six-photon sampling rate of 4 Hz over weeks. Heralded generation of a three-photon Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger state—a key milestone toward measurement-based quantum computing—is implemented.",

      "abstract": "Distributed quantum computing (DQC) combines the computing power of multiple networked quantum processing modules, ideally enabling the execution of large quantum circuits without compromising performance or qubit connectivity1,2. Photonic networks are well suited as a versatile and reconfigurable interconnect layer for DQC; remote entanglement shared between matter qubits across the network enables all-to-all logical connectivity through quantum gate teleportation (QGT)3,4. For a scalable DQC architecture, the QGT implementation must be deterministic and repeatable; until now, no demonstration has satisfied these requirements. Here we experimentally demonstrate the distribution of quantum computations between two photonically interconnected trapped-ion modules. The modules, separated by about two metres, each contain dedicated network and circuit qubits. By using heralded remote entanglement between the network qubits, we deterministically teleport a controlled-Z (CZ) gate between two circuit qubits in separate modules, achieving 86% fidelity. We then execute Grover’s search algorithm5—to our knowledge, the first implementation of a distributed quantum algorithm comprising several non-local two-qubit gates—and measure a 71% success rate. Furthermore, we implement distributed iSWAP and SWAP circuits, compiled with two and three instances of QGT, respectively, demonstrating the ability to distribute arbitrary two-qubit operations6. As photons can be interfaced with a variety of systems, the versatile DQC architecture demonstrated here provides a viable pathway towards large-scale quantum computing for a range of physical platforms. The distribution of quantum computations is demonstrated between two photonically interconnected trapped-ion modules, using repeatable, deterministic teleported controlled-Z gates to perform Grover’s search algorithm.",

Here we introduce a manufacturable platform7 for quantum computing with photons. We benchmark a set of monolithically integrated silicon-photonics-based modules to generate, manipulate, network and detect heralded photonic qubits, demonstrating dual-rail photonic qubits with 99.98% ± 0.01% state preparation and measurement fidelity, Hong–Ou–Mandel (HOM) quantum interference between independent photon sources with 99.50% ± 0.25% visibility, two-qubit fusion with 99.22% ± 0.12% fidelity and a chip-to-chip qubit interconnect with 99.72% ± 0.04% fidelity, conditional on photon detection and not accounting for loss. We preview a selection of next-generation technologies: low-loss silicon nitride (SiN) waveguides and components to address loss, as well as fabrication-tolerant photon sources, high-efficiency photon-number-resolving detectors (PNRDs), low-loss chip-to-fibre coupling and barium titanate (BTO) electro-optic phase shifters for high-performance fast switching. A manufacturable platform for quantum computing with photons is introduced and a set of monolithically integrated silicon-photonics-based modules is benchmarked, demonstrating dual-rail photonic qubits with performance close to thresholds required for operation.",

      "abstract": "Quantum computing is a vital research field in science and technology. One of the fundamental questions hardly known is how quantum computing research is developing to support scientific advances and the evolution of path-breaking technologies for economic, industrial, and social change. This study confronts the question here by applying methods of computational scientometrics for publication analyses to explain the structure and evolution of quantum computing research and technologies over a 30-year period. Results reveal that the evolution of quantum computing from 1990 to 2020 has a considerable average increase of connectivity in the network (growth of degree centrality measure), a moderate increase of the average influence of nodes on the flow between nodes (little growth of betweenness centrality measure), and a little reduction of the easiest access of each node to all other nodes (closeness centrality measure). This evolutionary dynamics is due to the increase in size and complexity of the network in quantum computing research over time. This study also suggests that the network of quantum computing has a transition from hardware to software research that supports accelerated evolution of technological pathways in quantum image processing, quantum machine learning, and quantum sensors. Theoretical implications of this study show the morphological evolution of the network in quantum computing from a symmetric to an asymmetric shape driven by new inter-related research fields and emerging technological trajectories. Findings here suggest best practices of innovation management based on R&D investments in new technological directions of quantum computing having a high potential for growth and impact in science and markets.",

      "abstract": "The preparation of quantum Gibbs states is a crucial task in quantum computing. In this work, we prove that a recently introduced, efficiently implementable dissipative evolution thermalizes to the Gibbs state in time scaling polynomially or even logarithmically with system size at high enough temperatures for any Hamiltonian that satisfies a Lieb-Robinson bound, such as local Hamiltonians on a lattice. Furthermore, we show the efficient adiabatic preparation of the associated purifications or \"thermofield double\" states. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results rigorously establishing the efficient preparation of high-temperature Gibbs states and their purifications. In the low-temperature regime, we show that implementing this family of dissipative evolutions for inverse temperatures polynomial in the system's size is computationally equivalent to standard quantum computations. On a technical level, for high temperatures, our proof makes use of the mapping of the generator of the evolution into a Hamiltonian, and then connecting its convergence to that of the infinite temperature limit. We further present an alternative proof that is based on showing the exponential decay of the so-called oscillator norm, yielding convergence in logarithmic times. For low temperature, we instead perform a perturbation at zero temperature and resort to circuit-to-Hamiltonian mappings akin to the proof of universality of quantum adiabatic computing. Taken together, our results show that a family of quasi-local dissipative evolutions efficiently prepares a large class of quantum many-body states of interest, and has the potential to mirror the success of classical Monte Carlo methods for quantum many-body systems.",

      "abstract": "Quantum computers are becoming a reality and numerous quantum computing applications with a near-term perspective (e.g., for finance, chemistry, machine learning, and optimization) and with a long-term perspective (e.g., for cryptography or unstructured search) are currently being investigated. However, designing and realizing potential applications for these devices in a scalable fashion requires automated, efficient, and user-friendly software tools that cater to the needs of end users, engineers, and physicists at every level of the entire quantum software stack. Many of the problems to be tackled in that regard are similar to design problems from the classical realm for which sophisticated design automation tools have been developed in the previous decades.The Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT) is a collection of software tools for quantum computing developed by the Chair for Design Automation at the Technical University of Munich which explicitly utilizes this design automation expertise. Our overarching objective is to provide solutions for design tasks across the entire quantum software stack. This entails high-level support for end users in realizing their applications, efficient methods for the classical simulation, compilation, and verification of quantum circuits, tools for quantum error correction, support for physical design, and more. These methods are supported by corresponding data structures (such as decision diagrams or the ZX-calculus) and core methods (such as SAT encodings/solvers). All of the developed tools are available as open-source implementations and are hosted on github.com/cda-tum.Note: A live version of this document is available at mqt.readthedocs.io.",

This Review focuses on quantum computing for financial applications and provides a summary for physicists on potential advantages and limitations of quantum techniques, as well as challenges that physicists could help tackle. Quantum algorithms for stochastic modelling, optimization and machine learning are applicable to various financial problems. Quantum Monte Carlo integration and gradient estimation can provide quadratic speedup over classical methods, but more work is required to reduce the amount of quantum resources for early fault-tolerant feasibility and achieving an actual speedup. Financial optimization problems can be continuous (convex or non-convex), discrete or mixed, and thus quantum algorithms for these problems can be applied. The advantages and challenges of quantum machine learning for classical problems are also apparent in finance. Quantum computers are expected to surpass the computational capabilities of classical computers and have a transformative impact on numerous industry sectors. We present a comprehensive summary of the state of the art of quantum computing for financial applications, with particular emphasis on stochastic modelling, optimization and machine learning. This Review is aimed at physicists, so it outlines the classical techniques used by the financial industry and discusses the potential advantages and limitations of quantum techniques. Finally, we look at the challenges that physicists could help tackle.",

      "abstract": "Quantum computers offer an intriguing path for a paradigmatic change of computing in the natural sciences and beyond, with the potential for achieving a so-called quantum advantage—namely, a significant (in some cases exponential) speedup of numerical simulations. The rapid development of hardware devices with various realizations of qubits enables the execution of small-scale but representative applications on quantum computers. In particular, the high-energy physics community plays a pivotal role in accessing the power of quantum computing, since the field is a driving source for challenging computational problems. This concerns, on the theoretical side, the exploration of models that are very hard or even impossible to address with classical techniques and, on the experimental side, the enormous data challenge of newly emerging experiments, such as the upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider. In this Roadmap paper, led by CERN, DESY, and IBM, we provide the status of high-energy physics quantum computations and give examples of theoretical and experimental target benchmark applications, which can be addressed in the near future. Having in mind hardware with about 100 qubits capable of executing several thousand two-qubit gates, where possible, we also provide resource estimates for the examples given using error-mitigated quantum computing. The ultimate declared goal of this task force is therefore to trigger further research in the high-energy physics community to develop interesting use cases for demonstrations on near-term quantum computers.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2024\n \n \n",

Specifically, we focus on the physical qubit architecture, which affects state preparation, qubit-to-qubit connectivity, gate fidelities, native gate instruction set, and individual qubit stability. These factors determine both the quantum-part execution time and the end-to-end wall clock time relevant for end-users, but also the ability to perform fault-tolerant quantum computation in the future.

      "abstract": "Linear optical quantum computing provides a desirable approach to quantum computing, with only a short list of required computational elements. The similarity between photons and phonons points to the interesting potential for linear mechanical quantum computing using phonons in place of photons. Although single-phonon sources and detectors have been demonstrated, a phononic beam splitter element remains an outstanding requirement. Here we demonstrate such an element, using two superconducting qubits to fully characterize a beam splitter with single phonons. We further use the beam splitter to demonstrate two-phonon interference, a requirement for two-qubit gates in linear computing. This advances a new solid-state system for implementing linear quantum computing, further providing straightforward conversion between itinerant phonons and superconducting qubits. Description Editor’s summary Phonons are the fundamental quantum vibrations within materials, with individual phonons representing the collective motion of many trillions of atoms. Efforts are underway to determine whether these mechanical vibrations can be developed into a quantum-computing architecture just like their optical cousin, photons. Qiao et al. demonstrate a beam splitter for single phonons and controlled two-phonon interference. Adding to the ability to launch and detect single phonons, a beam splitter now provides the final piece in the toolbox to develop a mechanically based platform for quantum computing. —Ian S. Osborne A beam splitter for phonons completes the toolbox required to develop a mechanically based quantum computing system.",

      "abstract": "\n Quantum computing hardware and software have made enormous strides over the last years1. Questions around quantum computing’s impact on research and society have changed from “if” to “when/how”. The 2020s have been described as the “quantum decade”, and the first production solutions that drive scientific and business value are expected to become available over the next years. Medicine, including fields in healthcare and life sciences, has seen a flurry of quantum-related activities and experiments in the last few years (although medicine and quantum theory have arguably been entangled ever since Schrödinger’s cat2). The initial focus was on biochemical and computational biology problems3,4,5,6,7,8; recently, however, clinical and medical quantum solutions have drawn increasing interest. The rapid emergence of quantum computing in health and medicine necessitates a mapping of the landscape.\n In this review, clinical and medical proof-of-concept quantum computing applications are outlined and put into perspective. These consist of over 40 experimental and theoretical studies from the last few years. The use case areas span genomics, clinical research and discovery, diagnostics, and treatments and interventions. Quantum machine learning (QML) in particular has rapidly evolved and shown to be competitive with classical benchmarks in recent medical research. Near-term QML algorithms, for instance, quantum support vector classifiers and quantum neural networks, have been trained with diverse clinical and real-world data sets. This includes studies in generating new molecular entities as drug candidates, diagnosing based on medical image classification, predicting patient persistence, forecasting treatment effectiveness, and tailoring radiotherapy. The use cases and the applied algorithms are summarized.\n In addition, this review provides an outlook on medicine in the quantum era. There has been much discussion about healthcare’s journey towards precision medicine and the quadruple aim (better health, lower costs, enhanced patient experiences, and improved healthcare practitioner work lives)9. While a range of technical and ethical challenges remain, quantum computing is poised to become a key enabler for advancing towards the holy grail: keeping people healthy through proactive medical care and guidance at the level of an individual.",

The holographic supergravity computations give well-defined results for both quantities and they satisfy the expected relations.

Spatiotemporal dynamics are modelled using a partial differential equation -- in contrast to the ordinary differential equation used in our previous work on temporal estimation of seizure dynamics [Cooray, 2016].

In this review, we detail a set of statistical procedures for inferring the structure of nonlinear coupled dynamical systems (structure learning), which has proved useful in neuroscience research. A key focus here is the comparison of competing models of (ie, hypotheses about) network architectures and implicit coupling functions in terms of their Bayesian model evidence. These methods are collectively referred to as dynamical casual modelling (DCM). We focus on a relatively new approach that is proving remarkably useful; namely, Bayesian model reduction (BMR), which enables rapid evaluation and comparison of models that differ in their network architecture. We illustrate the usefulness of these techniques through modelling neurovascular coupling (cellular pathways linking neuronal and vascular systems), whose function is an active focus of research in neurobiology and the imaging of coupled neuronal systems.",

      "abstract": "Active inference offers a first principle account of sentient behaviour, from which special and important cases can be derived, e.g., reinforcement learning, active learning, Bayes optimal inference, Bayes optimal design, etc. Active inference resolves the exploitation-exploration dilemma in relation to prior preferences, by placing information gain on the same footing as reward or value. In brief, active inference replaces value functions with functionals of (Bayesian) beliefs, in the form of an expected (variational) free energy. In this paper, we consider a sophisticated kind of active inference, using a recursive form of expected free energy. Sophistication describes the degree to which an agent has beliefs about beliefs. We consider agents with beliefs about the counterfactual consequences of action for states of affairs and beliefs about those latent states. In other words, we move from simply considering beliefs about 'what would happen if I did that' to 'what would I believe about what would happen if I did that'. The recursive form of the free energy functional effectively implements a deep tree search over actions and outcomes in the future. Crucially, this search is over sequences of belief states, as opposed to states per se. We illustrate the competence of this scheme, using numerical simulations of deep decision problems.",

However, computational neuroscience, despite its heavy reliance on concepts in physics, is anomalous in this regard as its main equations of motion are not compatible with a Lagrangian formulation and hence with the principle of stationary action. Taking the Dynamic Causal Modelling neuronal state equation, Hodgkin-Huxley model, and the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire model as examples, we show that it is possible to write complex oscillatory forms of these equations in terms of a single Lagrangian. We therefore bring mathematical descriptions in computational neuroscience under the remit of the principle of stationary action and use this reformulation to express symmetries and associated conservation laws arising in neural systems.",

      "abstract": "Models of coupled oscillators are useful in describing a wide variety of phenomena in physics, biology and economics. These models typically rest on the premise that the oscillators are weakly coupled, meaning that amplitudes can be assumed to be constant and dynamics can therefore be described purely in terms of phase differences. Whilst mathematically convenient, the restrictive nature of the weak coupling assumption can limit the explanatory power of these phase-coupled oscillator models. We therefore propose an extension to the weakly-coupled oscillator model that incorporates both amplitude and phase as dependent variables. We use the bilinear neuronal state equations of dynamic causal modelling as a foundation in deriving coupled differential equations that describe the activity of both weakly and strongly coupled oscillators. We show that weakly-coupled oscillator models are inadequate in describing the processes underlying the temporally variable signals observed in a variety of systems. We demonstrate that phase-coupled models perform well on simulations of weakly coupled systems but fail when connectivity is no longer weak. On the other hand, using Bayesian model selection, we show that our phase-amplitude coupling model can describe non-weakly coupled systems more effectively despite the added complexity associated with using amplitude as an extra dependent variable. We demonstrate the advantage of our phase-amplitude model in the context of model-generated data, as well as of a simulation of inter-connected pendula, neural local field potential recordings in rodents under anaesthesia and international economic gross domestic product data.",

      "abstract": "This technical note introduces parametric dynamic causal modelling, a method for inferring slow changes in biophysical parameters that control fluctuations of fast neuronal states. The application domain we have in mind is inferring slow changes in variables (e.g., extracellular ion concentrations or synaptic efficacy) that underlie phase transitions in brain activity (e.g., paroxysmal seizure activity). The scheme is efficient and yet retains a biophysical interpretation, in virtue of being based on established neural mass models that are equipped with a slow dynamic on the parameters (such as synaptic rate constants or effective connectivity). In brief, we use an adiabatic approximation to summarise fast fluctuations in hidden neuronal states (and their expression in sensors) in terms of their second order statistics; namely, their complex cross spectra. This allows one to specify and compare models of slowly changing parameters (using Bayesian model reduction) that generate a sequence of empirical cross spectra of electrophysiological recordings. Crucially, we use the slow fluctuations in the spectral power of neuronal activity as empirical priors on changes in synaptic parameters. This introduces a circular causality, in which synaptic parameters underwrite fast neuronal activity that, in turn, induces activity-dependent plasticity in synaptic parameters. In this foundational paper, we describe the underlying model, establish its face validity using simulations and provide an illustrative application to a chemoconvulsant animal model of seizure activity.",

Current estimates of time-varying epidemiological parameters often face problems such as lagging observations, averaging inference, and improper quantification of uncertainties. To address these problems, we propose a Bayesian data assimilation framework for time-varying parameter estimation. Specifically, this framework is applied to Rt estimation, resulting in the state-of-the-art DARt system. With DARt, time misalignment caused by lagging observations is tackled by incorporating observation delays into the joint inference of infections and Rt; the drawback of averaging is overcome by instantaneously updating upon new observations and developing a model selection mechanism that captures abrupt changes; the uncertainty is quantified and reduced by employing Bayesian smoothing. We validate the performance of DARt and demonstrate its power in revealing the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. The proposed approach provides a promising solution for accurate and timely estimating transmission dynamics from reported data.",

Here, we combine several of these (epidemic) models to create a (pandemic) model of viral spread among regions. Our focus is on a second wave of new cases that may result from loss of immunity--and the exchange of people between regions--and how mortality rates can be ameliorated under different strategic responses. In particular, we consider hard or soft social distancing strategies predicated on national (Federal) or regional (State) estimates of the prevalence of infection in the population. The modelling is demonstrated using timeseries of new cases and deaths from the United States to estimate the parameters of a factorial (compartmental) epidemiological model of each State and, crucially, coupling between States. Using Bayesian model reduction, we identify the effective connectivity between States that best explains the initial phases of the outbreak in the United States. Using the ensuing posterior parameter estimates, we then evaluate the likely outcomes of different policies in terms of mortality, working days lost due to lockdown and demands upon critical care. The provisional results of this modelling suggest that social distancing and loss of immunity are the two key factors that underwrite a return to endemic equilibrium.",

We thus provide a computational account of changes in effective connectivity within two regions of the fronto-parietal network, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the pre-supplementary motor area. We find that forward connections between the two regions increased in strength when task demands increased, and as the experimental session progressed. Similarities in the effects of task demands and time on task allow us to interpret changes in frontal connectivity in terms of increased attentional effort allocation that compensates cognitive fatigue.",

      "abstract": "Models of coupled oscillators are used to describe a wide variety of phenomena in neuroimaging. These models typically rest on the premise that oscillator dynamics do not evolve beyond their respective limit cycles, and hence that interactions can be described purely in terms of phase differences. Whilst mathematically convenient, the restrictive nature of phase-only models can limit their explanatory power. We therefore propose a generalisation of dynamic causal modelling that incorporates both phase and amplitude. This allows for the separate quantifications of phase and amplitude contributions to the connectivity between neural regions. We establish, using model-generated data and simulations of coupled pendula, that phase-only models perform well only under weak coupling conditions. We also show that, despite their higher complexity, phase-amplitude models can describe strongly coupled systems more effectively than their phase-only counterparts. We relate our findings to four metrics commonly used in neuroimaging: the Kuramoto order parameter, cross-correlation, phase-lag index, and spectral entropy. We find that, with the exception of spectral entropy, the phase-amplitude model is able to capture all metrics more effectively than the phase-only model. We then demonstrate, using local field potential recordings in rodents and functional magnetic resonance imaging in macaque monkeys, that amplitudes in oscillator models play an important role in describing neural dynamics in anaesthetised brain states.",

      "abstract": "This technical report describes a dynamic causal model of the spread of coronavirus through a population. The model is based upon ensemble or population dynamics that generate outcomes, like new cases and deaths over time. The purpose of this model is to quantify the uncertainty that attends predictions of relevant outcomes. By assuming suitable conditional dependencies, one can model the effects of interventions (e.g., social distancing) and differences among populations (e.g., herd immunity) to predict what might happen in different circumstances. Technically, this model leverages state-of-the-art variational (Bayesian) model inversion and comparison procedures, originally developed to characterise the responses of neuronal ensembles to perturbations. Here, this modelling is applied to epidemiological populations to illustrate the kind of inferences that are supported and how the model per se can be optimised given timeseries data. Although the purpose of this paper is to describe a modelling protocol, the results illustrate some interesting perspectives on the current pandemic; for example, the nonlinear effects of herd immunity that speak to a self-organised mitigation process.",

      "abstract": "By equipping a previously reported dynamic causal model of COVID-19 with an isolation state, we modelled the effects of self-isolation consequent on tracking and tracing. Specifically, we included a quarantine or isolation state occupied by people who believe they might be infected but are asymptomatic, and only leave if they test negative. We recovered maximum posteriori estimates of the model parameters using time series of new cases, daily deaths, and tests for the UK. These parameters were used to simulate the trajectory of the outbreak in the UK over an 18-month period. Several clear-cut conclusions emerged from these simulations. For example, under plausible (graded) relaxations of social distancing, a rebound of infections within weeks is unlikely. The emergence of a later second wave depends almost exclusively on the rate at which we lose immunity, inherited from the first wave. There exists no testing strategy that can attenuate mortality rates, other than by deferring or delaying a second wave. A sufficiently powerful tracking and tracing policy--implemented at the time of writing (10th May 2020)--will defer any second wave beyond a time horizon of 18 months. Crucially, this deferment is within current testing capabilities (requiring an efficacy of tracing and tracking of about 20% of asymptomatic infected cases, with less than 50,000 tests per day). These conclusions are based upon a dynamic causal model for which we provide some construct and face validation, using a comparative analysis of the United Kingdom and Germany, supplemented with recent serological studies.",

This paper introduces a model of the immune response to a virus. This is based upon the same sort of mean-field dynamics as used in epidemiology. However, in place of the location, clinical status, and other attributes of people in an epidemiological model, we consider the state of a virus, B and T-lymphocytes, and the antibodies they generate. Our aim is to formalise some key hypotheses as to the mechanism of resistance. We present a series of simple simulations illustrating changes to the dynamics of the immune response under these hypotheses. These include attenuated viral cell entry, pre-existing cross-reactive humoral (antibody-mediated) immunity, and enhanced T-cell dependent immunity. Finally, we illustrate the potential application of this sort of model by illustrating variational inversion (using simulated data) of this model to illustrate its use in testing hypotheses. In principle, this furnishes a fast and efficient immunological assay--based on sequential serology--that provides a (i) quantitative measure of latent immunological responses and (ii) a Bayes optimal classification of the different kinds of immunological response (c.f., glucose tolerance tests used to test for insulin resistance). This may be especially useful in assessing SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.",

In analogy to lesion studies, phantom perception may serve as a vehicle to understand the fundamental processing principles underlying auditory perception. With a special focus on tinnitus -- as the prime example of auditory phantom perception -- we review recent work at the intersection of artificial intelligence, psychology, and neuroscience. In particular, we discuss why everyone with tinnitus suffers from hearing loss, but not everyone with hearing loss suffers from tinnitus. We argue that the increase of sensory precision due to Bayesian inference could be caused by intrinsic neural noise and lead to a prediction error in the cerebral cortex. Hence, two fundamental processing principles - being ubiquitous in the brain - provide the most explanatory power for the emergence of tinnitus: predictive coding as a top-down, and stochastic resonance as a complementary bottom-up mechanism. We conclude that both principles play a crucial role in healthy auditory perception.",

However, the action can be invariant under change of scale in the special case of a scale free dynamical system that can be described in terms of a Lagrangian, that itself scales inversely with time. Crucially, this means symmetries under change of scale can exist in dynamical systems under certain constraints. Our contribution lies in the derivation of a generalised scale invariant Lagrangian - in the form of a power series expansion - that satisfies these constraints. This generalised Lagrangian furnishes a normal form for dynamic causal models (i.e., state space models based upon differential equations) that can be used to distinguish scale invariance (scale symmetry) from scale freeness in empirical data. We establish face validity with an analysis of simulated data and then show how scale invariance can be identified - and how the associated conserved quantities can be estimated - in neuronal timeseries.",

      "abstract": "Seizure activity is a ubiquitous and pernicious pathophysiology that, in principle, should yield to mathematical treatments of (neuronal) ensemble dynamics - and therefore interventions on stochastic chaos. A seizure can be characterised as a deviation of neural activity from a stable dynamical regime, i.e. one in which signals fluctuate only within a limited range. In silico treatments of neural activity are an important tool for understanding how the brain can achieve stability, as well as how pathology can lead to seizures and potential strategies for mitigating instabilities, e.g. via external stimulation. Here, we demonstrate that the (neuronal) state equation used in Dynamic Causal Modelling generalises to a Fokker-Planck formalism when propagation of neuronal activity along structural connections is considered. Using the Jacobian of this generalised state equation, we show that an initially unstable system can be rendered stable via a reduction in diffusivity (i.e., connectivity that disperses neuronal fluctuations). We show, for neural systems prone to epileptic seizures, that such a reduction can be achieved via external stimulation. Specifically, we show that this stimulation should be applied in such a way as to temporarily mirror epileptic activity in the areas adjoining an affected brain region - thus 'fighting seizures with seizures'. We offer proof of principle using simulations based on functional neuroimaging data collected from patients with idiopathic generalised epilepsy, in which we successfully suppress pathological activity in a distinct sub-network. Our hope is that this technique can form the basis for real-time monitoring and intervention devices that are capable of suppressing or even preventing seizures in a non-invasive manner.",

These include neural activity in which evidence for scale freeness has been reported using a range of imaging modalities. Here, we derive the ways in which connections within a network must transform - relative to system size - in order to maintain scale freeness and test these theoretical transformations via simulations. First, we explore the known invariance of planetary motion for orbits varying in size. Using parametric empirical Bayesian modelling and a generic dynamical systems model, we show that we recover Kepler's third law from orbital timeseries, using our proposed transformations; thereby providing construct validation. We then demonstrate that the dynamical critical exponent is inversely proportional to the time rescaling exponent, in the context of coarse graining operations. Using murine calcium imaging data, we then show that the dynamical critical exponent can be estimated in an empirical biological setting. Specifically, we compare dynamical critical exponents - associated with spontaneous and task states in two regions of imaged cortex - that are classified as task-relevant and task-irrelevant. We find, consistently across animals, that the task-irrelevant region exhibits higher dynamical critical exponents during spontaneous activity than during task performance. Conversely, the task-relevant region is associated with higher dynamical critical exponents in task vs. spontaneous states. These data support the idea that higher dynamical critical exponents, within relevant cortical structures, underwrite neuronal processing due to the implicit increase in cross-scale information transmission.",

      "abstract": "Engineering proteins is a challenging task requiring the exploration of a vast design space. Traditionally, this is achieved using Directed Evolution (DE), which is a laborious process. Generative deep learning, instead, can learn biological features of functional proteins from sequence and structural datasets and return novel variants. However, most models do not generate thermodynamically stable proteins, thus leading to many non-functional variants. Here we propose a model called PRotein Engineering by Variational frEe eNergy approximaTion (PREVENT), which generates stable and functional variants by learning the sequence and thermodynamic landscape of a protein. We evaluate PREVENT by designing 40 variants of the conditionally essential E. coli phosphotransferase N-acetyl-L-glutamate kinase (EcNAGK). We find 85% of the variants to be functional, with 55% of them showing similar growth rate compared to the wildtype enzyme, despite harbouring up to 9 mutations. Our results support a new approach that can significantly accelerate protein engineering. Generative deep learning models can generate novel proteins, but these are often not functional due to thermodynamic instability. Here, authors present a method to learn both the sequence and thermodynamic landscape of a protein and generate new functional variants.",

Until now, Bayesian model reduction has been applied mainly in the computational neuroscience community on simple models. In this paper, we formulate and apply Bayesian model reduction to perform principled pruning of Bayesian neural networks, based on variational free energy minimization. Direct application of Bayesian model reduction, however, gives rise to approximation errors. Therefore, a novel iterative pruning algorithm is presented to alleviate the problems arising with naive Bayesian model reduction, as supported experimentally on the publicly available UCI datasets for different inference algorithms. This novel parameter pruning scheme solves the shortcomings of current state-of-the-art pruning methods that are used by the signal processing community. The proposed approach has a clear stopping criterion and minimizes the same objective that is used during training. Next to these benefits, our experiments indicate better model performance in comparison to state-of-the-art pruning schemes.",

      "abstract": "We redevelop the variational free energy profile (vFEP) method using a cardinal B-spline basis to extend the method for analyzing free energy surfaces (FESs) involving three or more reaction coordinates. We also implemented software for evaluating high-dimensional profiles based on the multistate Bennett acceptance ratio (MBAR) method which constructs an unbiased probability density from global reweighting of the observed samples. The MBAR method takes advantage of a fast algorithm for solving the unbinned weighted histogram (UWHAM)/MBAR equations which replaces the solution of simultaneous equations with a nonlinear optimization of a convex function. We make use of cardinal B-splines and multiquadric radial basis functions to obtain smooth, differentiable MBAR profiles in arbitrary high dimensions. The cardinal B-spline vFEP and MBAR methods are compared using three example systems that examine 1D, 2D, and 3D profiles. Both methods are found to be useful and produce nearly indistinguishable results. The vFEP method is found to be 150 times faster than MBAR when applied to periodic 2D profiles, but the MBAR method is 4.5 times faster than vFEP when evaluating unbounded 3D profiles. In agreement with previous comparisons, we find the vFEP method produces superior FESs when the overlap between umbrella window simulations decreases. Finally, the associative reaction mechanism of hammerhead ribozyme is characterized using 3D, 4D, and 6D profiles, and the higher-dimensional profiles are found to have smaller reaction barriers by as much as 1.5 kcal/mol. The methods presented here have been implemented into the FE-ToolKit software package along with new methods for network-wide free energy analysis in drug discovery.",

      "abstract": "The Kalman filter is an algorithm for the estimation of hidden variables in dynamical systems under linear Gauss-Markov assumptions with widespread applications across different fields. Recently, its Bayesian interpretation has received a growing amount of attention especially in neuroscience, robotics and machine learning. In neuroscience, in particular, models of perception and control under the banners of predictive coding, optimal feedback control, active inference and more generally the so-called Bayesian brain hypothesis, have all heavily relied on ideas behind the Kalman filter. Active inference, an algorithmic theory based on the free energy principle, specifically builds on approximate Bayesian inference methods proposing a variational account of neural computation and behaviour in terms of gradients of variational free energy. Using this ambitious framework, several works have discussed different possible relations between free energy minimisation and standard Kalman filters. With a few exceptions, however, such relations point at a mere qualitative resemblance or are built on a set of very diverse comparisons based on purported differences between free energy minimisation and Kalman filtering. In this work, we present a straightforward derivation of Kalman filters consistent with active inference via a variational treatment of free energy minimisation in terms of gradient descent. The approach considered here offers a more direct link between models of neural dynamics as gradient descent and standard accounts of perception and decision making based on probabilistic inference, further bridging the gap between hypotheses about neural implementation and computational principles in brain and behavioural sciences.",

By drawing upon the concept known as the variational free energy principle, the paper will explore how this principle can be used to temper rational choice theory by re-formulating how agents optimize. The approach will result in agent behavior that encompasses a wide range of so-called cognitive biases, as seen in the scientific literature of behavioral economics, but instead of using these biases as further indications of market inefficiencies or market failures, the paper will likewise attempt to show the limits to which these biases can inform or critique standard economic theory. The paper therefore offers up a “middle of the road” approach, in which the neoclassical agent is not quite as “rational” as rational choice theory assumes, but at the same time, not quite as irrational as behavioral economics would often have us believe.",

Specifically, we ask whether neuronal responses in an in vitro neuronal network are consistent with ideal Bayesian observer responses under the free energy principle. In brief, we stimulated an in vitro cortical cell culture with stimulus trains that had a known statistical structure. We then asked whether recorded neuronal responses were consistent with variational message passing based upon free energy minimisation (i.e., evidence maximisation). Effectively, this required us to solve two problems: first, we had to formulate the Bayes-optimal encoding of the causes or sources of sensory stimulation, and then show that these idealised responses could account for observed electrophysiological responses. We describe a simulation of an optimal neural network (i.e., the ideal Bayesian neural code) and then consider the mapping from idealised in silico responses to recorded in vitro responses. Our objective was to find evidence for functional specialisation and segregation in the in vitro neural network that reproduced in silico learning via free energy minimisation. Finally, we combined the in vitro and in silico results to characterise learning in terms of trajectories in a variational information plane of accuracy and complexity.",

We focus on non-realist (deflationary and fictionalist-instrumentalist) approaches. We consider a deflationary account of mental representation, according to which the explanatorily relevant contents of neural representations are mathematical, rather than cognitive, and a fictionalist or instrumentalist account, according to which representations are scientifically useful fictions that serve explanatory (and other) aims. After reviewing the free-energy principle and active inference, we argue that the model of adaptive phenotypes under the free-energy principle can be used to furnish a formal semantics, enabling us to assign semantic content to specific phenotypic states (the internal states of a Markovian system that exists far from equilibrium). We propose a modified fictionalist account—an organism-centered fictionalism or instrumentalism. We argue that, under the free-energy principle, pursuing even a deflationary account of the content of neural representations licenses the appeal to the kind of semantic content involved in the ‘aboutness’ or intentionality of cognitive systems; our position is thus coherent with, but rests on distinct assumptions from, the realist position. We argue that the free-energy principle thereby explains the aboutness or intentionality in living systems and hence their capacity to parse their sensory stream using an ontology or set of semantic factors.",

However, at times, searching for good collective variables can be challenging. In a recent paper, we combined time-lagged independent component analysis with well-tempered metadynamics in order to obtain improved collective variables from metadynamics runs that use lower quality collective variables [ McCarty, J.; Parrinello, M. J. Chem. Phys. 2017 , 147 , 204109 ]. In this work, we extend these ideas to variationally enhanced sampling. This leads to an efficient scheme that is able to make use of the many advantages of the variational scheme. We apply the method to alanine-3 in water. From an alanine-3 variationally enhanced sampling trajectory in which all the six dihedral angles are biased, we extract much better collective variables able to describe in exquisite detail the protein complex free energy surface in a low dimensional representation. The success of this investigation is helped by a more accurate way of calculating the correlation functions needed in the time-lagged independent component analysis and from the introduction of a new basis set to describe the dihedral angles arrangement.",

Models with non-convex interactions are much less well-understood, and simple variational formulas involving the same functional are known to be invalid in general. We show here that a slightly weaker property of the limit free energy does extend to non-convex models. Indeed, under the assumption that the limit free energy exists, we show that this limit can always be represented as a critical value of the said functional. Up to a small perturbation of the parameters defining the model, we also show that any subsequential limit of the law of the overlap matrix is a critical point of this functional. We believe that these results capture the fundamental conclusions of the non-rigorous replica method.",

A large number of solutions have been proposed to alleviate this problem. Many are based on the introduction of a bias potential which is a function of a small number of collective variables. However constructing such a bias is not simple. Here we introduce a functional of the bias potential and an associated variational principle. The bias that minimizes the functional relates in a simple way to the free energy surface. This variational principle can be turned into a practical, efficient, and flexible sampling method. A number of numerical examples are presented which include the determination of a three-dimensional free energy surface. We argue that, beside being numerically advantageous, our variational approach provides a convenient and novel standpoint for looking at the sampling problem.",

The Ant Colony scheme is coupled with a local search procedure and provides high quality solutions. The benchmarks we carried out prove possible to obtain solutions as profitable as CARPET ones can be obtained using such scheme when a sufficient number of iterations is devoted to the ants. It competes with the Genetic Algorithm of Lacomme et al. regarding solution quality but it is more time consuming on large scale instances. The method has been intensively benchmarked on the well-known instances of Eglese, DeArmon and the last ones of Belenguer and Benavent.

When an ant colony's nest becomes unsuitable due to size constraints or damage, the colony must relocate to a new nest. The task of identifying and evaluating the quality of potential new nests is distributed among all ants. The ants must additionally reach consensus on a final nest choice and the full colony must be transported to this single new nest. Our goal is to use tools and techniques from distributed computing theory in order to gain insight into the house-hunting process.   We develop a formal model for the house-hunting problem inspired by the behavior of the Temnothorax genus of ants. We then show a Ω(log n) lower bound on the time for all n ants to agree on one of k candidate nests. We also present two algorithms that solve the house-hunting problem in our model. The first algorithm solves the problem in optimal O(log n) time but exhibits some features not characteristic of natural ant behavior. The second algorithm runs in O(k log n) time and uses an extremely simple and natural rule for each ant to decide on the new nest.",

The principle of the method is inspired by the work of Chialvo and Millonas who developed the first numerical simulation in which swarm cognitive map formation could be explained. From this point, an extended model is presented in order to deal with digital image habitats, in which artificial ants could be able to react to the environment and perceive it. Evolution of pheromone fields point that artificial ant colonies could react and adapt appropriately to any type of digital habitat.

In other words, we realize ant colony migration as a self-organizing phenotype-level collective behavior. For this purpose, we first segment the edges of the graph of ants' pathways. Then, each segment, attributed to its own pheromone profile, may host an ant. So, multiple ants may occupy an edge at the same time. Thanks to this segment-wise edge formulation, ants have more selection options in the course of their pathway determination, thereby increasing the diversity of their colony's emergent behaviors. In light of the continuous pheromone dynamics of segments, each edge owns a spatio-temporal piece-wise continuous pheromone profile in which both deposit and evaporation processes are unified. The passive dynamics of the proposed migration mechanism is sufficiently rich so that an ant colony can migrate to the vicinity of a new nest site in a self-organizing manner without any external supervision. In particular, we perform extensive simulations to test our migration dynamics applied to a colony including 500 ants traversing a pathway graph comprising 200 nodes and 4000 edges which are segmented based on various resolutions. The obtained results exhibit the effectiveness of our strategy.",

      "abstract": "Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is renowned for its effectiveness in solving Traveling Salesman Problems, yet it faces computational challenges in CPU-based environments, particularly with large-scale instances. In response, we introduce a Tensorized Ant Colony Optimization (TensorACO) to utilize the advancements of GPU acceleration. As the core, TensorACO fully transforms ant system and ant path into tensor forms, a process we refer to as tensorization. For the tensorization of ant system, we propose a preprocessing method to reduce the computational overhead by calculating the probability transition matrix. In the tensorization of ant path, we propose an index mapping method to accelerate the update of pheromone matrix by replacing the mechanism of sequential path update with parallel matrix operations. Additionally, we introduce an Adaptive Independent Roulette (AdaIR) method to overcome the challenges of parallelizing ACO's selection mechanism on GPUs. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of TensorACO achieving up to 1921$\\times$ speedup over standard ACO. Moreover, the AdaIR method further improves TensorACO's convergence speed by 80% and solution quality by 2%. Source codes are available at https://github.com/EMI-Group/tensoraco.",

The strength of the proposed global weighting of the AACA algorithm depends on employing solely the pheromone matrix information present on any group of four adjacent pixels to decide which case deserves a maximum global weight value or not.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such work on the ACS which shares many key elements of the ACO and the MMAS, but differences in the process of building solutions and updating the pheromone trails make obtaining an efficient parallel version for the GPUs a difficult task. The proposed parallel versions of the ACS differ mainly in their implementations of the pheromone memory. The first two use the standard pheromone matrix, and the third uses a novel selective pheromone memory. Computational experiments conducted on several Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) instances of sizes ranging from 198 to 2392 cities showed that the parallel ACS on Nvidia Kepler GK104 GPU (1536 CUDA cores) is able to obtain a speedup up to 24.29x vs the sequential ACS running on a single core of Intel Xeon E5-2670 CPU. The parallel ACS with the selective pheromone memory achieved speedups up to 16.85x, but in most cases the obtained solutions were of significantly better quality than for the sequential ACS.",

Given two strings, the traditional technique for finding Longest Common Subsequence is based on Dynamic Programming which consists of creating a recurrence relation and filling a table of size . The proposed algorithm draws analogy with behavior of ant colonies function and this new computational paradigm is known as Ant System. It is a viable new approach to Stochastic Combinatorial Optimization. The main characteristics of this model are positive feedback, distributed computation, and the use of constructive greedy heuristic. Positive feedback accounts for rapid discovery of good solutions, distributed computation avoids premature convergence and greedy heuristic helps find acceptable solutions in minimum number of stages. We apply the proposed methodology to Longest Common Subsequence Problem and give the simulation results. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by efficient Computational Complexity.

ACO with Aphids strategy is designed to improve solution quality of discrete domain Dynamic Optimization Problems (DOPs) with event-triggered discrete dynamism. The proposed strategy aims to improve the inter-state convergence rate throughout the entire dynamic optimization. It does so by minimizing the fitness penalty and maximizing the convergence speed that occurs after the dynamic change. This strategy is tested against Full-Restart and Pheromone-Sharing strategies implemented on the same ACO core algorithm solving Dynamic Multidimensional Knapsack Problem (DMKP) benchmarks. ACO with Aphids has demonstrated superior performance over the Pheromone-Sharing strategy in every test on average gap reduced by 29.2%. Also, ACO with Aphids has outperformed the Full-Restart strategy for large datasets groups, and the overall average gap is reduced by 52.5%.",

      "abstract": "Quantum ant colony optimization (QACO) has drew much attention since it combines the advantages of quantum computing and ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithms and overcomes some limitations of the traditional ACO algorithm. However, due to the hardware resource limitations of currently available quantum computers, such as the limited number of qubits, lack of high-fidelity gating operation, and low noisy tolerance, the practical application of the QACO is quite challenging. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm by combining the clustering algorithm with QACO algorithm, so that this extended QACO can handle large-scale optimization problems, which makes the practical application of QACO based on available quantum computation resource possible. To verify the effectiveness and performance of the algorithm, we tested the developed QACO algorithm with the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) as benchmarks. The developed QACO algorithm shows better performance under multiple data set. In addition, the developed QACO algorithm also manifests the robustness to noise of calculation process, which is typically a major barrier for practical application of quantum computers. Our work shows that the combination of the clustering algorithm with QACO has effectively extended the application scenario of QACO in current NISQ era of quantum computing.",

This goes beyond multifractal analysis, which only considers those level sets when $K$ ranges in the set of singletons $\\{α\\}$, $α\\in\\R^d$. We also give a $0$-$\\infty$ law for the Hausdorff and packing measures of the level sets $E(\\{α\\})$, and compute the free energy of the associated logarithmically correlated random energy model in full generality. Moreover, our results complete the previous works on multifractal analysis by including the levels $α$ which do not belong to the range of the gradient of the free energy. This covers in particular a situation until now badly understood, namely the case where a first order phase transition occurs. As a consequence of our study, we can also describe the whole singularity spectrum of Mandelbrot measures, as well as the associated free energy function (or $L^q$-spectrum), when a first order phase transition occurs.",

Using a simplified network with one node per country, the cost-optimal system is calculated for a 95% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions compared to 1990, incorporating electricity, transport and heat demand. Flexibility from battery electric vehicles (BEV), power-to-gas units (P2G) and long-term thermal energy storage (LTES) make a significant contribution to the smoothing of variability from wind and solar and to the reduction of total system costs. The cost-minimising integration of BEV pairs well with the daily variations of solar power, while P2G and LTES balance the synoptic and seasonal variations of demand and renewables. In all scenarios, an expansion of cross-border transmission reduces system costs, but the more tightly the energy sectors are coupled, the weaker the benefit of transmission reinforcement becomes.",

      "abstract": "With the emergence of energy communities, where a number of prosumers invest in shared generation and storage, the issue of fair allocation of benefits is increasingly important. The Shapley value has attracted increasing interest for redistribution in energy settings - however, computing it exactly is intractable beyond a few dozen prosumers. In this paper, we first conduct a systematic review of the literature on the use of Shapley value in energy-related applications, as well as efforts to compute or approximate it. Next, we formalise the main methods for approximating the Shapley value in community energy settings, and propose a new one, which we call the stratified expected value approximation. To compare the performance of these methods, we design a novel method for exact Shapley value computation, which can be applied to communities of up to several hundred agents by clustering the prosumers into a smaller number of demand profiles. We perform a large-scale experimental comparison of the proposed methods, for communities of up to 200 prosumers, using large-scale, publicly available data from two large-scale energy trials in the UK (UKERC Energy Data Centre, 2017, UK Power Networks Innovation, 2021). Our analysis shows that, as the number of agents in the community increases, the relative difference to the exact Shapley value converges to under 1% for all the approximation methods considered. In particular, for most experimental scenarios, we show that there is no statistical difference between the newly proposed stratified expected value method and the existing state-of-the-art method that uses adaptive sampling (O'Brien et al., 2015), although the cost of computation for large communities is an order of magnitude lower.",

The modeling framework accounts for dynamic charging/discharging efficiencies and maximum cycling powers as well as cycle and calendar degradation of a Li-ion battery system. Results from a small-scale distributed power system indicate that incorporating the dynamic efficiencies and cycling powers of batteries in the generation planning problem does not significantly change the optimal generation portfolio, while adding substantial computational burden. In contrast, accounting for battery degradation leads to substantially different generation expansion outcomes, especially in deep decarbonization scenarios with larger energy storage capacities. Under the assumptions used in this study, it is found that battery energy storage is economically viable for 2020 only under strict carbon emission constraints. In contrast, given the projected technology advances and corresponding cost reductions, battery energy storage exhibits an attractive option to enable deep decarbonization in 2050.",

      "abstract": "Achieving the economical and stable operation of Multi-microgrids (MMG) systems is vital. However, there are still some challenging problems to be solved. Firstly, from the perspective of stable operation, it is necessary to minimize the energy fluctuation of the main grid. Secondly, the characteristics of energy conversion equipment need to be considered. Finally, privacy protection while reducing the operating cost of an MMG system is crucial. To address these challenges, a Data-driven strategy for MMG systems with Shared Energy Storage (SES) is proposed. The Mixed-Attention is applied to fit the conditions of the equipment, additionally, Multi-Agent Soft Actor-Critic(MA-SAC) and (Multi-Agent Win or Learn Fast Policy Hill-Climbing)MA-WoLF-PHC are proposed to solve the partially observable dynamic stochastic game problem. By testing the operation data of the MMG system in Northwest China, following conclusions are drawn: the R-Square (R2) values of results reach 0.999, indicating the neural network effectively models the nonlinear conditions. The proposed MMG system framework can reduce energy fluctuations in the main grid by 1746.5kW in 24 hours and achieve a cost reduction of 16.21% in the test. Finally, the superiority of the proposed algorithms is verified through their fast convergence speed and excellent optimization performance.",

To handle multiple uncertainties, a Wasserstein generative adversarial network with a gradient penalty was used to generate renewable scenarios, and the Kmeans++ clustering algorithm was employed to generate typical scenarios.

The load shifting benefits obtained by deploying an advanced coordination strategy are compared against a baseline controller for various home characteristics, such as location, size and equipment. The simulation study shows that the deployment of the smart home energy management strategy achieves approximately 5% reduction in grid cost compared to a baseline strategy. This is achieved by deferring approximately 50\\% of the flexible loads, which is possible due to the use of the stationary energy storage.",

By analyzing the power exchange characteristics of heterogeneous energy, the homogenization models of various heterogeneous energy sources are established. According to the analysis of power system flexibility margin, three dimensions of flexibility margin evaluation indexes are defined from the dimension of system operation, and an electricity hydrogen coupling energy block scheduling model is established.

Cooperating agents learn to control the flexibility offered by electric vehicles, space heating and flexible loads in a partially observable stochastic environment. In the standard independent Q-learning approach, the coordination performance of agents under partial observability drops at scale in stochastic environments. Here, the novel combination of learning from off-line convex optimisations on historical data and isolating marginal contributions to total rewards in reward signals increases stability and performance at scale. Using fixed-size Q-tables, prosumers are able to assess their marginal impact on total system objectives without sharing personal data either with each other or with a central coordinator. Case studies are used to assess the fitness of different combinations of exploration sources, reward definitions, and multi-agent learning frameworks. It is demonstrated that the proposed strategies create value at individual and system levels thanks to reductions in the costs of energy imports, losses, distribution network congestion, battery depreciation and greenhouse gas emissions.",

Its emergence provides a new solution to the problems of energy utilization and environmental pollution. To coordinate the integrated demand response and uncertainty of renewable energy generation (RGs), a data-driven two-stage distributionally robust optimization (DRO) model is constructed. A comprehensive norm consisting of the 1-norm and infinity-norm is used as the uncertainty probability distribution information set, thereby avoiding complex probability density information. To address multiple uncertainties of RGs, a generative adversarial network based on the Wasserstein distance with gradient penalty is proposed to generate RG scenarios, which has wide applicability. To further tap the potential of the demand response, we take into account the ambiguity of human thermal comfort and the thermal inertia of buildings. Thus, an integrated demand response mechanism is developed that effectively promotes the consumption of renewable energy. The proposed method is simulated in an actual CIES in North China. In comparison with traditional stochastic programming and robust optimization, it is verified that the proposed DRO model properly balances the relationship between economical operation and robustness while exhibiting stronger adaptability. Furthermore, our approach outperforms other commonly used DRO methods with better operational economy, lower renewable power curtailment rate, and higher computational efficiency.",

The corresponding Hamiltonians are Hermitian and pseudo-Hermitian (\"gamma5 Hermitian\"), respectively. The fundamental spinor solutions for all generalized Dirac equations are found in the helicity basis and brought into concise analytic form. We postulate that the time-ordered product of field operators should yield the Feynman propagator (i*epsilon prescription), and we also postulate that the tardyonic as well as tachyonic Dirac equations should have a smooth massless limit. These postulates lead to sum rules that connect the form of the fundamental field anticommutators with the tensor sums of the fundamental plane-wave eigenspinors and the projectors over positive-energy and negative-energy states. In the massless case, the sum rules are fulfilled by two egregiously simple, distinguished functional forms. The first sum rule remains valid in the case of a tardyonic theory and leads to the canonical massive Dirac field. The second sum rule is valid for a tachyonic mass term and leads to a natural suppression of the right-handed helicity states for tachyonic particles, and left-handed helicity states for tachyonic spin-1/2 antiparticles. When applied to neutrinos, the theory contains a free tachyonic mass parameter. Tachyons are known to be repulsed by gravity. We discuss a possible role of a tachyonic neutrino as a contribution to the accelerated expansion of the Universe (\"dark energy\").",

The first stage determines the installation locations and the initial capacity of DGs using the well-known loss sensitivity factor (LSF) approach, and the second stage identifies the optimal installation capacities of DGs to maximize the investment benefits and system voltage stability and to minimize line losses. In the second stage, the multi-objective ant lion optimizer (MOALO) is first applied to obtain the Pareto-optimal solutions, and then the 'best' compromise solution is identified by calculating the priority memberships of each solution via grey relation projection (GRP) method, while finally, in order to address the uncertain outputs of DGs, energy storage devices are installed whose maximum outputs are determined with the use of chance-constrained programming. The test results on the PG&E 69-bus distribution system demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to other current state-of-the-art approaches, and that the integration of energy storage makes the DGs operate at their pre-designed rated capacities with the probability of at least 60% which is novel.",

This study presents a techno-economic analysis for implementation of a hybrid renewable energy system at the South Pole in Antarctica, which currently hosts several high-energy physics experiments with nontrivial power needs. A tailored model of resource availability and economics for solar photovoltaics, wind turbine generators, lithium-ion energy storage, and long-duration energy storage at this site is explored in different combinations with and without existing diesel energy generation. The Renewable Energy Integration and Optimization (REopt) platform is used to determine the optimal system component sizing and the associated system economics and environmental benefit. We find that the least-cost system includes all three energy generation sources and lithium-ion energy storage. For an example steady-state load of 170 kW, this hybrid system includes 180 kW-DC of photovoltaic panels, 570 kW of wind turbines, and a 3.4 MWh lithium-ion battery energy storage system. This system reduces diesel consumption by 95% compared to an all-diesel configuration, resulting in approximately 1200 metric tons of carbon footprint avoided annually. Over the course of a 15-year analysis period the reduced diesel usage leads to a net savings of 57 million United States dollars, with a time to payback of approximately two years. All the scenarios modeled show that the transition to renewables is highly cost effective under the unique economics and constraints of this extremely remote site.",

      "abstract": "Advances in machine learning and increased computational power have driven progress in energy-related research. However, limited access to private energy data from buildings hinders traditional regression models relying on historical data. While generative models offer a solution, previous studies have primarily focused on short-term generation periods (e.g., daily profiles) and a limited number of meters. Thus, the study proposes a conditional diffusion model for generating high-quality synthetic energy data using relevant metadata. Using a dataset comprising 1,828 power meters from various buildings and countries, this model is compared with traditional methods like Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGAN) and Conditional Variational Auto-Encoders (CVAE). It explicitly handles long-term annual consumption profiles, harnessing metadata such as location, weather, building, and meter type to produce coherent synthetic data that closely resembles real-world energy consumption patterns. The results demonstrate the proposed diffusion model's superior performance, with a 36% reduction in Frechet Inception Distance (FID) score and a 13% decrease in Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL divergence) compared to the following best method. The proposed method successfully generates high-quality energy data through metadata, and its code will be open-sourced, establishing a foundation for a broader array of energy data generation models in the future.",

Recent advancements in deep learning (DL) have significantly improved OAR contouring performance, yet the reliability of these models, especially in the presence of out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, remains a concern in clinical settings. This application study explores the integration of epistemic uncertainty estimation within the OAR contouring workflow to enable OOD detection in clinically relevant scenarios, using specifically compiled data. Furthermore, we introduce an advanced statistical method for OOD detection to enhance the methodological framework of uncertainty estimation. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that epistemic uncertainty estimation is effective in identifying instances where model predictions are unreliable and may require an expert review. Notably, our approach achieves an AUC-ROC of 0.95 for OOD detection, with a specificity of 0.95 and a sensitivity of 0.92 for implant cases, underscoring its efficacy. This study addresses significant gaps in the current research landscape, such as the lack of ground truth for uncertainty estimation and limited empirical evaluations. Additionally, it provides a clinically relevant application of epistemic uncertainty estimation in an FDA-approved and widely used clinical solution for OAR segmentation from Varian, a Siemens Healthineers company, highlighting its practical benefits.",

Animals show a variety of social structures from egalitarian to hierarchical. In this study, we examine how different forms of social hierarchy shape foraging decisions. We developed a mechanistic analytically tractable model to study the underlying processes of social foraging, tying the microscopic individual to the macroscopic group levels. Based on a stochastic evidence accumulation framework, we developed a model of patch-leaving decisions in a large hierarchical group with leading and following individuals. Across a variety of information sharing mechanisms, we were able to analytically quantify emergent collective dynamics. We found that follower-leader dynamics through observations of leader movements or through counting the number of individuals in a patch confers, for most conditions, a benefit for the following individuals by increasing their accuracy in inferring patch richness. On the other hand, misinformation, through the communication of false beliefs about food rewards or patch quality, shows to be detrimental to following individuals, but paradoxically may lead to increased group cohesion. In an era where there is a huge amount of animal foraging data collected, our model provides a systematic way to conceptualize and understand those data by uncovering hidden mechanisms underlying social foraging decisions.",

      "abstract": "Foraging is a fundamental behavior as animals' search for food is crucial for their survival. Patch leaving is a canonical foraging behavior, but classic theoretical conceptions of patch leaving decisions lack some key naturalistic details. Optimal foraging theory provides general rules for when an animal should leave a patch, but does not provide mechanistic insights about how those rules change with the structure of the environment. Such a mechanistic framework would aid in designing quantitative experiments to unravel behavioral and neural underpinnings of foraging. To address these shortcomings, we develop a normative theory of patch foraging decisions. Using a Bayesian approach, we treat patch leaving behavior as a statistical inference problem. We derive the animals' optimal decision strategies in both non-depleting and depleting environments. A majority of these cases can be analyzed explicitly using methods from stochastic processes. Our behavioral predictions are expressed in terms of the optimal patch residence time and the decision rule by which an animal departs a patch. We also extend our theory to a hierarchical model in which the forager learns the environmental food resource distribution. The quantitative framework we develop will therefore help experimenters move from analyzing trial based behavior to continuous behavior without the loss of quantitative rigor. Our theoretical framework both extends optimal foraging theory and motivates a variety of behavioral and neuroscientific experiments investigating patch foraging behavior.",

However, the issue of how the interactions between multiple foragers influence their search efficiency is still not completely understood. To address this, we consider a model to study the optimal strategy for a group of foragers searching for targets distributed heterogeneously. In our model foragers move on a square lattice containing immobile but regenerative targets. At any instant a forager is able to detect only those targets that happen to be in the same site. However, we allow the foragers to have information about the state of other foragers. A forager who has not detected any target walks towards the nearest location, where another forager has detected a target, with probability $\\exp{\\left(-αd\\right)}$, where $d$ is the distance and $α$ is a parameter. The model reveals that neither overcrowding ($α\\to 0$) nor independent searching ($α\\to\\infty$) is beneficial for the group. For patchy distribution of targets the efficiency is maximum for intermediate values of $α$. Also, in the limit $α\\to 0$, the length of the walks can become scale-free.",

We find that, when the termination is regulated by a finite number of steps $N$, the optimum value of $μ$ that maximises the foraging efficiency can vary substantially in the interval $μ\\in (1,3)$, depending on the landscape features (landscape size and number of targets). We further demonstrate that subjective returning can be another significant factor that affects the foraging efficiency in such context. Our results suggest that Lévy-flight foraging may arise through an interaction between the environmental context and the termination of exploitation, and particularly that the number of steps can play an important role in this scenario which is overlooked by most previous work. Our study not only provides a new perspective on Lévy-flight foraging, but also opens new avenues for investigating the interaction between foraging dynamics and environment as well as offers a realistic framework for analysing animal movement patterns from empirical data.",

The optimal strategies of each of these configurations are here analyzed explicitly also with the aid of some special functions of classical flavor and the results are confronted with the existing paradigms of the Lévy foraging hypothesis.   Interestingly, one discovers bifurcation phenomena in which a sudden switch occurs between an optimal (but somehow unreliable) Lévy foraging pattern of inverse square law type and a less ideal (but somehow more secure) classical Brownian motion strategy.

Understanding which foraging strategies are optimal and how animals learn them are central challenges in modeling animal foraging. While the question of optimality has wide-ranging implications across fields such as economy, physics, and ecology, the question of learnability is a topic of ongoing debate in evolutionary biology. Recognizing the interconnected nature of these challenges, this work addresses them simultaneously by exploring optimal foraging strategies through a reinforcement learning framework. To this end, we model foragers as learning agents. We first prove theoretically that maximizing rewards in our reinforcement learning model is equivalent to optimizing foraging efficiency. We then show with numerical experiments that, in the paradigmatic model of non-destructive search, our agents learn foraging strategies which outperform the efficiency of some of the best known strategies such as Lévy walks. These findings highlight the potential of reinforcement learning as a versatile framework not only for optimizing search strategies but also to model the learning process, thus shedding light on the role of learning in natural optimization processes.",

      "abstract": "Foraging site constancy, or repeated return to the same foraging location, is a foraging strategy used by many species to decrease uncertainty, but it is often unclear exactly how the foraging site is identified. Here we focus on the context where food harvesting is first preceded by a separate exploration period. Foraging then consists of three distinct steps: (1) exploration of the landscape (site-generation), (2) selection of a foraging site (site-selection), and (3) exploitation (harvesting) through repeated trips between the foraging site and \"home base\". This type of foraging has received scant attention by modellers, leading to two main knowledge gaps. First, little is known about how organisms implement steps (1) and (2). Second, it is not known how the choice of implementation method affects the outcomes of step (3). We investigate these two gaps using an agent-based model, with bumble bees as our model organism, foraging in a patchy resource landscape of crop, wildflower, and empty cells. We tested two different site-generation methods (random and circular foray exploration behaviour) and four different site-selection methods (random and optimizing based on distance from the nest, local wildflower density, or net rate of energy return) on a variety of outcomes from the site-constant harvesting step. We find that site-selection method has a high impact on crop pollination services as well as the percent of crop resources collected, while site-generation method has a high impact on the percent of time spent harvesting and the total trip time. We also find that some of the patterns we identify can be used to infer how a given real organism is identifying a foraging site. Our results underscore the importance of explicitly considering exploratory behaviour to better understand the ecological consequences of foraging dynamics.",

This study investigates how individuals adapt their foraging strategies in response to resource distribution and foraging time constraints.

This task engages multiple cognitive abilities, such as navigation, learning, and memorization of treasure box locations. Findings indicate that participants adjust their foraging strategies -- encompassing both stay-or-leave decisions, such as the number of boxes opened in initial areas and behavioral aspects, such as the time to navigate from box to box -- depending on both resource distribution and foraging time. Additionally, they improved their performance over time as an effect of both enhanced navigation skills and adaptation of foraging strategies. Finally, participants' performance was initially distant from the reward-maximizing performance of optimal agents due to the learning process humans undergo; however, it approximated the optimal agent's performance towards the end of the task, without fully reaching it. These results highlight the flexibility of human foraging behavior and underscore the importance of employing optimality models and ecologically rich scenarios to study foraging.",

Here, we investigate deep reinforcement learning agents in an ecological patch foraging task. For the first time, we show that machine learning agents can learn to patch forage adaptively in patterns similar to biological foragers, and approach optimal patch foraging behavior when accounting for temporal discounting. Finally, we show emergent internal dynamics in these agents that resemble single-cell recordings from foraging non-human primates, which complements experimental and theoretical work on the neural mechanisms of biological foraging.

Ant foraging is a prime example of individuals following simple behavioral rules based on local information producing complex, organized and ``intelligent'' strategies at the population level. One of its main aspects is the widespread use of pheromones, which are chemical compounds laid by the ants used to attract other ants to a food source. In this work, we consider a continuous description of a population of ants and simulate numerically the foraging behavior using a system of PDEs of chemotaxis type. We show that, numerically, this system accurately reproduces observed foraging behavior, such as trail formation and efficient removal of food sources.",

A relatively new area, called \"Explainable AI,\" is emerging to help address this problem, but little is known about how users would forage through information an explanation system might offer. To inform the development of Explainable AI systems, we conducted a formative study, using the lens of Information Foraging Theory, into how experienced users foraged in the domain of StarCraft to assess an agent. Our results showed that participants faced difficult foraging problems. These foraging problems caused participants to entirely miss events that were important to them, reluctantly choose to ignore actions they did not want to ignore, and bear high cognitive, navigation, and information costs to access the information they needed.",

      "abstract": "Foraging is crucial for animals to survive. Many species forage in groups, as individuals communicate to share information about the location of available resources. For example, eusocial foragers, such as honey bees and many ants, recruit members from their central hive or nest to a known foraging site. However, the optimal level of communication and recruitment depends on the overall group size, the distribution of available resources, and the extent of interference between multiple individuals attempting to forage from a site. In this paper, we develop a discrete-time Markov chain model of eusocial foragers, who communicate information with a certain probability. We compare the stochastic model and its corresponding infinite-population limit. We find that foraging efficiency tapers off when recruitment probability is too high -- a phenomenon that does not occur in the infinite-population model, even though it occurs for any finite population size. The marginal inefficiency at high recruitment probability increases as the population increases, similar to a boundary layer. In particular, we prove there is a significant gap between the foraging efficiency of finite and infinite population models in the extreme case of complete communication. We also analyze this phenomenon by approximating the stationary distribution of foragers over sites in terms of mean escape times from multiple quasi-steady states. We conclude that for any finite group of foragers, an individual who has found a resource should only sometimes recruit others to the same resource. We discuss the relationship between our analysis and multi-agent multi-arm bandit problems.",

We compare conditions for plant coexistence for non-adaptive vs. adaptive pollinators that adjust their foraging strategy to maximize fitness. When pollinators have fixed preferences, we show that plant coexistence typically requires both weak competition between plants for resources (e.g., space or nutrients) and pollinator preferences that are not too biased in favour of either plant. We also show how plant coexistence is promoted by indirect facilitation via the pollinator. When pollinators are adaptive foragers, pollinator's diet maximizes pollinator's fitness measured as the per capita population growth rate. Simulations show that this has two conflicting consequences for plant coexistence. On the one hand, when competition between pollinators is weak, adaptation favours pollinator specialization on the more profitable plant which increases asymmetries in plant competition and makes their coexistence less likely. On the other hand, when competition between pollinators is strong, adaptation promotes generalism, which facilitates plant coexistence. In addition, adaptive foraging allows pollinators to survive sudden loss of the preferred plant host, thus preventing further collapse of the entire community.

      "abstract": "A canonical foraging task is the patch-leaving problem, in which a forager must decide to leave a current resource in search for another. Theoretical work has derived optimal strategies for when to leave a patch, and experiments have tested for conditions where animals do or do not follow an optimal strategy. Nevertheless, models of patch-leaving decisions do not consider the imperfect and noisy sampling process through which an animal gathers information, and how this process is constrained by neurobiological mechanisms. In this theoretical study, we formulate an evidence accumulation model of patch-leaving decisions where the animal averages over noisy measurements to estimate the state of the current patch and the overall environment. Evidence accumulation models belong to the class of drift diffusion processes and have been used to model decision making in different contexts. We solve the model for conditions where foraging decisions are optimal and equivalent to the marginal value theorem, and perform simulations to analyze deviations from optimal when these conditions are not met. By adjusting the drift rate and decision threshold, the model can represent different strategies, for example an increment-decrement or counting strategy. These strategies yield identical decisions in the limiting case but differ in how patch residence times adapt when the foraging environment is uncertain. To account for sub-optimal decisions, we introduce an energy-dependent utility function that predicts longer than optimal patch residence times when food is plentiful. Our model provides a quantitative connection between ecological models of foraging behavior and evidence accumulation models of decision making. Moreover, it provides a theoretical framework for potential experiments which seek to identify neural circuits underlying patch leaving decisions.",

      "abstract": "Animals typically forage in groups. Social foraging can help animals avoid predation and decrease their uncertainty about the richness of food resources. Despite this, theoretical mechanistic models of patch foraging have overwhelmingly focused on the behavior of single foragers. In this study, we develop a mechanistic model describing the behavior of individuals foraging together and departing food patches following an evidence accumulation process. Each individual's belief about patch quality is represented by a stochastically accumulating variable coupled to others' belief, representing the transfer of information. We consider a cohesive group, and model information sharing as either intermittent pulsatile coupling (communicate decision to leave) or continuous diffusive coupling (communicate online belief). Foraging efficiency under pulsatile coupling has a stronger dependence on the coupling strength parameter compared to diffusive. Despite employing minimal information transfer, pulsatile coupling can still provide similar or higher foraging efficiency compared to diffusive coupling. Conversely, diffusive coupling is more robust to parameter detuning and performs better when individuals have heterogeneous departure criteria and social information weighting. Efficiency is measured by a reward rate function that balances the amount of energy accumulated against the time spent in a patch, computed by solving an ordered first passage time problem for the patch departures of each individual. Using synthetic data we show that we can distinguish between the two modes of communication and identify the model parameters. Our model establishes a social patch foraging framework to parse and identify deliberative decision strategies, to distinguish different forms of social communication, and to allow model fitting to real world animal behavior data.",

When the forager eats, it can wander $\\mathcal{S}$ additional steps without food before starving to death. When the forager does not eat, either by not detecting food on a full site or by encountering an empty site, the forager goes hungry and comes one time unit closer to starvation. As the forager wanders, a multiply connected spatial region where food has been consumed---a desert---is created. The forager lifetime depends non-monotonically on its degree of myopia $p$, and at the optimal myopia $p=p^*(\\mathcal{S})$, the forager lives much longer than a normal forager that always eats when it encounters food.

Large telemetry and tracking data sets have been collected for this group of animals, and are accompanied by many theoretical studies of optimal foraging strategies. However, relatively few studies have detailed statistical methods for inferring behaviours in central place foraging trips. In this paper we describe an approach based on hidden Markov models, which splits foraging trips into segments labelled as \"outbound\", \"search\", \"forage\", and \"inbound\". By structuring the hidden Markov model transition matrix appropriately, the model naturally handles the sequence of behaviours within a foraging trip. Additionally, by structuring the model in this way, we are able to develop realistic simulations from the fitted model. We demonstrate our approach on data from southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) tagged on Kerguelen Island in the Southern Ocean. We discuss the differences between our 4-state model and the widely used 2-state model, and the advantages and disadvantages of employing a more complex model.",

Individuals foraging in groups act based on both their private observations and the opinions of their neighbors. How do these information sources interact in changing environments? We address this problem in the context of honeybee swarms, showing inhibitory social interactions help maintain adaptivity and consensus needed for effective foraging. Individual and social interactions of a mathematical swarm model shape the nutrition yield of a group foraging from feeders with temporally switching food quality. Social interactions improve foraging from a single feeder if temporal switching is fast or feeder quality is low. When the swarm chooses from multiple feeders, the most effective form of social interaction is direct switching, whereby bees flip the opinion of nestmates foraging at lower yielding feeders. Model linearization shows that effective social interactions increase the fraction of the swarm at the correct feeder (consensus) and the rate at which bees reach that feeder (adaptivity). Our mathematical framework allows us to compare a suite of social inhibition mechanisms, suggesting experimental protocols for revealing effective swarm foraging strategies in dynamic environments.",

      "abstract": "We present a biologically inspired design for swarm foraging based on ant's pheromone deployment, where the swarm is assumed to have very restricted capabilities. The robots do not require global or relative position measurements and the swarm is fully decentralized and needs no infrastructure in place. Additionally, the system only requires one-hop communication over the robot network, we do not make any assumptions about the connectivity of the communication graph and the transmission of information and computation is scalable versus the number of agents. This is done by letting the agents in the swarm act as foragers or as guiding agents (beacons). We present experimental results computed for a swarm of Elisa-3 robots on a simulator, and show how the swarm self-organizes to solve a foraging problem over an unknown environment, converging to trajectories around the shortest path. At last, we discuss the limitations of such a system and propose how the foraging efficiency can be increased.",

      "abstract": "Theory purports that animal foraging choices evolve to maximize returns, such as net energy intake. Empirical research in both human and nonhuman animals reveals that individuals often attend to the foraging choices of their competitors while making their own foraging choices. Due to the complications of gathering field data or constructing experiments, however, broad facts relating theoretically optimal and empirically realized foraging choices are only now emerging. Here, we analyze foraging choices of a cohort of professional day traders who must choose between trading the same stock multiple times in a row---patch exploitation---or switching to a different stock---patch exploration---with potentially higher returns. We measure the difference between a trader's resource intake and the competitors' expected intake within a short period of time---a difference we call short-term comparative returns. We find that traders' choices can be explained by foraging heuristics that maximize their daily short-term comparative returns. However, we find no one-best relationship between different trading choices and net income intake. This suggests that traders' choices can be short-term win oriented and, paradoxically, maybe maladaptive for absolute market returns.",

      "abstract": "Foraging and acquiring of food is a delicate balance between managing the costs, both energy and social, and individual preferences. Previous research on the solitary foraging of free ranging dogs showed that they prioritized the nutritionally highest valued food patch first but do not ignore other less valuable food either, displaying typical scavenger behaviour. The current experiment was carried out on groups of dogs with the same set up to see the change in foraging strategies, if any, under the influence of social cost like intra-group competition. We found multiple differences between the strategies of dogs foraging alone versus in groups with competition playing an implicit role in the decision making of dogs when foraging in groups. Dogs were able to continually assess and evaluate the available resources in a patch and adjust their behaviour accordingly. Foraging in groups also provided benefits of reduced individual vigilance. The various decisions and choices made seemed to have a basis in the optimal foraging theory wherein the dogs harvested the nutritionally richest patch possible with the least risk and cost involved but was willing to compromise if that was not possible. This underscores the cognitive, quick decision-making abilities and adaptable behaviour of these dogs.",

      "abstract": "Epilepsy is still quite common, affecting over 50 million individuals worldwide, despite the tremendous advances in contemporary therapy. Early detection and treatment can greatly lower the chance of long-term harm and raise living standards for those with epilepsy. Electroencephalography (EEG), a non-invasive method that tracks electrical activity in the brain, is frequently used to diagnose this neurological disorder. Yet, using EEG data for diagnosis and study raises a number of issues with patient privacy and security protocols for such private digital data. An early epilepsy diagnostic system and a decentralized, secure environment for exchanging EEG data based on a block chain-based system with DL integration are presented in this work. The proposed method makes it possible to maintain patients’ personal data confidentiality and, at the same time, increase the efficiency of early epilepsy diagnosis. The most frequently used preprocessing technique in the strategy is Multiple Discrete Orthonormal S-Transforms (MDOSTs), and for feature extraction, Memory Efficient Vision Transformer-based Feature Extraction is employed. In classification, we use an Epistemic Neural Network (ENN) to achieve high precision and reliable prediction through the Electric Eel Foraging Optimization (EEFO) algorithm. The storage and dissemination of the data are both proactively secured through blockchain; through smart contracts, patients completely govern their data. The analysis of the Temple University Hospital EEG Corpus (TUH EEG) dataset proves that this method is diagnosed more than the traditional one, while the protection level of this data is also high. By achieving above 99% performance on all evaluation measures, such as F1-score, accuracy, recall, specificity, and precision, the suggested method demonstrates its remarkable efficacy in both secure EEG data sharing and early epilepsy detection. The method's higher performance over conventional approaches can be attributed to its strong deep learning models and block chain integration.",

      "abstract": "This paper describes an active inference scheme for visual searches and the perceptual synthesis entailed by scene construction. Active inference assumes that perception and action minimize variational free energy, where actions are selected to minimize the free energy expected in the future. This assumption generalizes risk-sensitive control and expected utility theory to include epistemic value; namely, the value (or salience) of information inherent in resolving uncertainty about the causes of ambiguous cues or outcomes. Here, we apply active inference to saccadic searches of a visual scene. We consider the (difficult) problem of categorizing a scene, based on the spatial relationship among visual objects where, crucially, visual cues are sampled myopically through a sequence of saccadic eye movements. This means that evidence for competing hypotheses about the scene has to be accumulated sequentially, calling upon both prediction (planning) and postdiction (memory). Our aim is to highlight some simple but fundamental aspects of the requisite functional anatomy; namely, the link between approximate Bayesian inference under mean field assumptions and functional segregation in the visual cortex. This link rests upon the (neurobiologically plausible) process theory that accompanies the normative formulation of active inference for Markov decision processes. In future work, we hope to use this scheme to model empirical saccadic searches and identify the prior beliefs that underwrite intersubject variability in the way people forage for information in visual scenes (e.g., in schizophrenia).",

      "abstract": "Humans and many animals can selectively sample important parts of their visual surroundings to carry out their daily activities like foraging or finding prey or mates. Selective attention allows them to efficiently use the limited resources of the brain by deploying sensory apparatus to collect data believed to be pertinent to the organism's current task in hand.  Robots or other computational agents operating in dynamic environments are similarly exposed to a wide variety of stimuli, which they must process with limited sensory and computational resources. Developing computational models of visual attention has long been of interest as such models enable artificial systems to select necessary information from complex and cluttered visual environments, hence reducing the data-processing burden.  Biologically inspired computational saliency models have previously been used in selectively sampling a visual scene, but these have limited capacity to deal with dynamic environments and have no capacity to reason about uncertainty when planning their visual scene sampling strategy. These models typically select contrast in colour, shape or orientation as salient and sample locations of a visual scene in descending order of salience. After each observation, the area around the sampled location is blocked using inhibition of return mechanism to keep it from being re-visited.  This thesis generalises the traditional model of saliency by using an adaptive Kalman filter estimator to model an agent's understanding of the world and uses a utility function based approach to describe what the agent cares about in the visual scene. This allows the agents to adopt a richer set of perceptual strategies than is possible with the classical winner-take-all mechanism of the traditional saliency model. In contrast with the traditional approach, inhibition of return is achieved without implementing an extra mechanism on top of the underlying structure.  This thesis demonstrates the use of five utility functions that are used to encapsulate the perceptual state that is valued by the agent. Each utility function thereby produces a distinct perceptual behaviour that is matched to particular scenarios.  The resulting visual attention distribution of the five proposed utility functions is demonstrated on five real-life videos.  In most of the experiments, pixel intensity has been used as the source of the saliency map. As the proposed approach is independent of the saliency map used, it can be used with other existing more complex saliency map building models. Moreover, the underlying structure of the model is sufficiently general and flexible, hence it can be used as the base of a new range of more sophisticated gaze control systems.",

But our worlds now include increasing numbers of powerful and (apparently) disembodied generative artificial intelligence (AI). In what follows we ask how best to understand these new (somewhat ‘alien’, because of their disembodied nature) resources and how to incorporate them in our educational practices. We focus on methodologies that encourage exploration and embodied interactions with ‘prepared’ material environments, such as the carefully organized settings of Montessori education. Using the active inference framework, we approach our questions by thinking about human learning as epistemic foraging and prediction error minimization. We end by arguing that generative AI should figure naturally as new elements in prepared learning environments by facilitating sequences of precise prediction error enabling trajectories of self-correction. In these ways, we anticipate new synergies between (apparently) disembodied and (essentially) embodied forms of intelligence.

      "abstract": "Biological systems—like ourselves—are constantly faced with uncertainty. Despite noisy sensory data, and volatile environments, creatures appear to actively maintain their integrity. To account for this remarkable ability to make optimal decisions in the face of a capricious world, we propose a generative model that represents the beliefs an agent might possess about their own uncertainty. By simulating a noisy and volatile environment, we demonstrate how uncertainty influences optimal epistemic (visual) foraging. In our simulations, saccades were deployed less frequently to regions with a lower sensory precision, while a greater volatility led to a shorter inhibition of return. These simulations illustrate a principled explanation for some cardinal aspects of visual foraging—and allow us to propose a correspondence between the representation of uncertainty and ascending neuromodulatory systems, complementing that suggested by Yu & Dayan (Yu & Dayan 2005 Neuron 46, 681–692.

      "abstract": "Recent work in cognitive and computational neuroscience depicts human brains as devices that minimize prediction error signals: signals that encode the difference between actual and expected sensory stimulations. This raises a series of puzzles whose common theme concerns a potential misfit between this bedrock informationtheoretic vision and familiar facts about the attractions of the unexpected. We humans often seem to actively seek out surprising events, deliberately harvesting novel and exciting streams of sensory stimulation. Conversely, we often experience some wellexpected sensations as unpleasant and to-be-avoided. In this paper, I explore several core and variant forms of this puzzle, using them to display multiple interacting elements that together deliver a satisfying solution. That solution requires us to go beyond the discussion of simple information-theoretic imperatives (such as 'minimize long-term prediction error') and to recognize the essential role of species-specific prestructuring, epistemic foraging, and cultural practices in shaping the restless, curious, novelty-seeking human mind.",

      "abstract": "In previous papers, we introduced a normative scheme for scene construction and epistemic (visual) searches based upon active inference. This scheme provides a principled account of how people decide where to look, when categorising a visual scene based on its contents. In this paper, we use active inference to explain the visual searches of normal human subjects; enabling us to answer some key questions about visual foraging and salience attribution. First, we asked whether there is any evidence for ‘epistemic foraging’; i.e. exploration that resolves uncertainty about a scene. In brief, we used Bayesian model comparison to compare Markov decision process (MDP) models of scan-paths that did–and did not–contain the epistemic, uncertainty-resolving imperatives for action selection. In the course of this model comparison, we discovered that it was necessary to include non-epistemic (heuristic) policies to explain observed behaviour (e.g., a reading-like strategy that involved scanning from left to right). Despite this use of heuristic policies, model comparison showed that there is substantial evidence for epistemic foraging in the visual exploration of even simple scenes. Second, we compared MDP models that did–and did not–allow for changes in prior expectations over successive blocks of the visual search paradigm. We found that implicit prior beliefs about the speed and accuracy of visual searches changed systematically with experience. Finally, we characterised intersubject variability in terms of subject-specific prior beliefs. Specifically, we used canonical correlation analysis to see if there were any mixtures of prior expectations that could predict between-subject differences in performance; thereby establishing a quantitative link between different behavioural phenotypes and Bayesian belief updating. We demonstrated that better scene categorisation performance is consistently associated with lower reliance on heuristics; i.e., a greater use of a generative model of the scene to direct its exploration.",

      "abstract": "Information gathering comprises actions whose (sensory) consequences resolve uncertainty (i.e., are salient). In other words, actions that solicit salient information cause the greatest shift in beliefs (i.e., information gain) about the causes of our sensations. However, not all information is relevant to the task at hand: this is especially the case in complex, naturalistic scenes. This paper introduces a formal model of selective attention based on active inference and contextual epistemic foraging. We consider a visual search task with a special emphasis on goal-directed and task-relevant exploration. In this scheme, attention modulates the expected fidelity (precision) of the mapping between observations and hidden states in a state-dependent or context-sensitive manner. This ensures task-irrelevant observations have little expected information gain, and so the agent – driven to reduce expected surprise (i.e., uncertainty) – does not actively seek them out. Instead, it selectively samples task-relevant observations, which inform (task-relevant) hidden states. We further show, through simulations, that the atypical exploratory behaviours in conditions such as autism and anxiety may be due to a failure to appropriately modulate sensory precision in a context-specific way.",

      "abstract": "The construct of epistemic trust has received much consideration in recent psychological literature, even though mainly from a theoretical perspective. The overall aim of this study was to validate the first self-report measure of epistemic trust–the Epistemic Trust, Mistrust, and Credulity Questionnaire (ETMCQ)–in an Italian sample. Our primary goal was to test the factorial validity of the instrument, also exploring the influence of age, gender, and level of education on epistemic trust (Study 1, n = 843). Secondarily, we investigated the associations between epistemic trust, mistrust, credulity, and other aspects of psychological functioning, as well as with the presence of adverse childhood experiences in a smaller number of participants (Study 2, n = 445). Besides the ETMCQ, the survey included an ad hoc questionnaire investigating socio-demographic characteristics and self-report measures of reflective functioning, mentalized affectivity, traumatic experiences, attachment, and psychological symptoms. Statistical analysis showed a three-factor hierarchical structure similar to the model proposed in the original validation, with some differences that suggest an influence of cultural factors in determining individuals’ epistemic stance. Our results corroborate previous theoretical contributions regarding the association between epistemic trust and psychological wellbeing, and between epistemic disruptions and higher levels of psychological suffering. Both Mistrust and Credulity were significantly related to the presence of childhood traumatic experiences, attachment avoidance and anxiety, lower levels of mentalization, lower abilities in emotional regulation, and higher levels of psychopathological symptoms. The ETMCQ represents an easily administered and time-effective tool. Its use could pave the way for interesting clinical and theoretical findings.",

Our shared responsibility to rectify that injustice should be at the top of the ethics agenda. That it is not, or only is in part, is deeply problematic and endangers the credibility of the entire field. As a first step towards reorienting the field, this paper offers a comprehensive account of epistemic justice for global health ethics. We first introduce several different conceptions of justice and decolonisation in relation to knowledge, purposefully drawing on work emanating from the global South as well as the global North. We then apply those conceptions to the global health ethics context to generate a tripartite account of the layers of epistemic justice in the field: who is producing ethics knowledge; what theories and concepts are being applied to produce ethics knowledge; and whose voices are sought, recorded and used to generate ethics knowledge. These layers reflect that the field spans conceptual and empirical research. We conclude by proposing that, going forward, three avenues are key to achieve greater epistemic justice at each layer and to help decolonise global health ethics: namely, understanding the problem, dialogue and structural change.",

The insula cortex, organized in hierarchical modules, is the major cortical region receiving interoceptive afferents and contains visceral topographic maps. Yet, the biological significance of the insula's modular architecture in relation to deep brain regions remains unsolved. In this opinion, we propose the Insula Hierarchical Modular Adaptive Interoception Control (IMAC) model to suggest that insula modules (granular, dysgranular and agranular subregions), forming networks with prefrontal (supplementary motor area, dorsolateral and ventromedial cortices) and striatum (posterior, dorsomedial and ventromedial) subregions, are specialized for higher-order interoceptive representations, recruited in a context-dependent manner to support habitual, model-based and exploratory adaptive behavior. We then discuss how insula interoceptive representations, or metaceptions, could give rise to conscious interoceptive feelings built up from low-order visceral representations and associated basic emotions located in deep interoceptive brain structures.",

      "abstract": "Building autonomous -- i.e., choosing goals based on one's needs -- and adaptive -- i.e., surviving in ever-changing environments -- agents has been a holy grail of artificial intelligence (AI). A living organism is a prime example of such an agent, offering important lessons about adaptive autonomy. Here, we focus on interoception, a process of monitoring one's internal environment to keep it within certain bounds, which underwrites the survival of an organism. To develop AI with interoception, we need to factorize the state variables representing internal environments from external environments and adopt life-inspired mathematical properties of internal environment states. This paper offers a new perspective on how interoception can help build autonomous and adaptive agents by integrating the legacy of cybernetics with recent advances in theories of life, reinforcement learning, and neuroscience.",

      "abstract": "Interoception and exteroception provide continuous feedback about the body and the environment, yet how they are dynamically integrated within a unified predictive coding framework has remained under-specified. This paper develops and empirically validates an integrative predictive coding model that treats interoceptive and exteroceptive inference as parallel hierarchical systems exchanging precision-weighted prediction errors. Within this framework, arbitration between the two streams is governed by relative precision weights (w) and integrated within the anterior insula (AIC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Computational simulations of the model reproduced biologically plausible dynamics: prediction errors decayed exponentially while arbitration weights self-normalized toward equilibrium (w = 0.5), demonstrating stable convergence and coherent integration. Simulated anxiety and PTSD profiles, characterized respectively by interoceptive and exteroceptive overweighting, yielded rigid, self-sustaining imbalances (w to 1 or w to 0) and slowed recalibration. Empirical application of the arbitration equation to published EEG-fMRI datasets further validated the model. The framework contributes a unifying account of how dysregulated precision weighting may underlie anxiety (overweighted interoception) and PTSD (underweighted interoception). Building on this validation, a proposed experimental paradigm is outlined to test the model's predictions in humans. It examines recalibration across anxiety, neutral, and PTSD groups following targeted interoceptive or exteroceptive therapies. Key predictions include identifiable neural markers of coherence, modulation of heartbeat-evoked potentials by vagal stimulation, and precision-sensitive behavioral signatures in interoceptive-exteroceptive congruency tasks.",

      "abstract": "Building autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) with optimized efficiency and adaptive capabilities-able to respond to changing task demands and dynamic environments-is a strongly desired goal for advancing construction robotics. Such robots can play a critical role in enabling automation, reducing operational carbon footprints, and supporting modular construction processes. Inspired by the adaptive autonomy of living organisms, we introduce interoception, which centers on the robot's internal state representation, as a foundation for developing self-reflection and conscious learning to enable continual learning and adaptability in robotic agents. In this paper, we factorize internal state variables and mathematical properties as \"cognitive dissonance\" in shared control paradigms, where human interventions occasionally occur. We offer a new perspective on how interoception can help build adaptive motion planning in AMRs by integrating the legacy of heuristic costs from grid/graph-based algorithms with recent advances in neuroscience and reinforcement learning. Declarative and procedural knowledge extracted from human semantic inputs is encoded into a hypergraph model that overlaps with the spatial configuration of onsite layout for path planning. In addition, we design a velocity-replay module using an encoder-decoder architecture with few-shot learning to enable robots to replicate velocity profiles in contextualized scenarios for multi-robot synchronization and handover collaboration. These \"cached\" knowledge representations are demonstrated in simulated environments for multi-robot motion planning and stacking tasks. The insights from this study pave the way toward artificial general intelligence in AMRs, fostering their progression from complexity to competence in construction automation.",

      "abstract": "Typically, AI researchers and roboticists try to realize intelligent behavior in machines by tuning parameters of a predefined structure (body plan and/or neural network architecture) using evolutionary or learning algorithms. Another but not unrelated longstanding property of these systems is their brittleness to slight aberrations, as highlighted by the growing deep learning literature on adversarial examples. Here we show robustness can be achieved by evolving the geometry of soft robots, their control systems, and how their material properties develop in response to one particular interoceptive stimulus (engineering stress) during their lifetimes. By doing so we realized robots that were equally fit but more robust to extreme material defects (such as might occur during fabrication or by damage thereafter) than robots that did not develop during their lifetimes, or developed in response to a different interoceptive stimulus (pressure). This suggests that the interplay between changes in the containing systems of agents (body plan and/or neural architecture) at different temporal scales (evolutionary and developmental) along different modalities (geometry, material properties, synaptic weights) and in response to different signals (interoceptive and external perception) all dictate those agents' abilities to evolve or learn capable and robust strategies.",

      "abstract": "Mindfulness-based interventions have proven its efficacy in treating post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but the underlying neurobiological mechanism is unknown. To determine the neurobiological mechanism of action of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) treating PTSD, we conducted a randomized clinical trial (RCT) in which 98 veterans with PTSD were randomly assigned to receive MBSR therapy (n = 47) or present-centered group therapy (PCGT; n = 51; an active-control condition). Pre- and post-intervention measures of PTSD symptom severity (PTSD Checklist) and brain activity measures of electroencephalography (EEG) were assessed, including spectral power of spontaneous neural oscillatory activities during resting and meditation periods, time-frequency (TF) power of cognitive task-related brain responses, and TF power of heartbeat-evoked brain responses (HEBR) that reflect cardiac interoceptive brain responses during resting and meditation. Compared to controls, the MBSR group had greater improvements in PTSD symptoms, spontaneous EEG alpha (8-13 Hz) power in posterior sites, task-related frontal theta power (4-7 Hz in 140-220 ms post-stimulus), and frontal theta HEBR (3-5 Hz and 265-328 ms post-R-peak). Latent difference score modeling found that only the changes in the frontal theta HEBR mediated the MBSR treatment effect. Brain source-level analysis found that the theta HEBR changes in the anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insular cortex, and the lateral prefrontal cortex predicted PTSD symptom improvements. These results indicated that mindfulness meditation improves spontaneous brain activities reflecting internally oriented relaxation and brain functions of attentional control. However, interoceptive brain capacity enhanced by MBSR appears to be the primary cerebral mechanism that regulates emotional disturbances and improves anxiety symptoms of PTSD.",

Understanding users' interoception contributes to a better understanding of individually different emotional abilities, which is essential for achieving inter-individually accurate emotion estimation. However, existing interoception measurement methods, such as the heart rate discrimination task, have several limitations, including their dependence on a well-controlled laboratory environment and precision apparatus, making monitoring users' interoception challenging. This study aims to determine other forms of data that can explain users' interoceptive or similar states in their real-world lives and propose a novel hypothetical concept \"cyberoception,\" a new sense (1) which has properties similar to interoception in terms of the correlation with other emotion-related abilities, and (2) which can be measured only by the sensors embedded inside commodity smartphone devices in users' daily lives. Results from a 10-day-long in-lab/in-the-wild hybrid experiment reveal a specific cyberoception type \"Turn On\" (users' subjective sensory perception about the frequency of turning-on behavior on their smartphones), significantly related to participants' emotional valence. We anticipate that cyberoception to serve as a fundamental building block for developing more \"emotion-aware\", user-friendly applications and services.",

Furthermore, we investigate the relationship between interoceptive sensibility and the intensity of the feeling of creativity. By employing body-mapping assessments and emotional evaluations on 353 participants exposed to various chord progressions, we revealed the critical role of heart sensations in eliciting feelings of creativity. Our findings indicate that musical chord progressions characterized by high uncertainty and surprise generated heightened feelings of creativity alongside increased arousal. Notably, heart sensations correlated positively with the feeling of creativity, suggesting the crucial role of interoceptive bodily sensations in the experience of creativity. In contrast, the feelings of beauty and valence were more strongly influenced by predictable, low-uncertainty progressions, suggesting that the feelings of creativity may operate through a somewhat different cognitive mechanism than that of beauty and valence. This study highlights the complex interplay between bodily sensations and feelings of creativity based on predictive processing. By framing creativity within the framework of interoception, our research contributes to a deeper understanding of the emotional and embodied processes that shape the experience of creativity. Future research should explore these relationships to enrich our comprehension of creativity in both artistic endeavors and everyday life.",

A detailed study of several effects biasing the electron energy measurement allowed an energy reconstruction procedure to be developed that ensures a good linearity and a good resolution. Use is made of detailed Monte Carlo simulations based on Geant which describe the longitudinal and transverse shower profiles as well as the energy distributions. For electron energies between 15 GeV and 180 GeV the deviation of the measured incident electron energy over the beam energy is within 0.1%. The systematic uncertainty of the measurement is about 0.1% at low energies and negligible at high energies.

      "abstract": "In this paper we study in detail the connection between the solutions to the Dirac and Weyl equation and the associated electromagnetic 4-potentials. First, it is proven that all solutions to the Weyl equations are degenerate, in the sense that they correspond to an infinite number of electromagnetic 4-potentials. As far as the solutions to the Dirac equation are concerned, it is shown that they can be classified into two classes. The elements of the first class correspond to one and only one 4-potential, and are called non-degenerate Dirac solutions. On the other hand, the elements of the second class correspond to an infinite number of 4-potentials, and are called degenerate Dirac solutions. Further, it is proven that at least two of these 4-potentials are gauge-inequivalent, corresponding to different electromagnetic fields. In order to illustrate this particularly important result we have studied the denerate solutions to the force-free Dirac equation and shown that they correspond to massless particles. We have also provided explicit examples regarding solutions to the force-free Weyl equation and the Weyl equation for a constant magnetic field. In all cases we have calculated the infinite number of different electromagnetic fields corresponding to these solutions.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents the scenario that gravitational waves, generated in core-collapse of a pre-supernova star, can produce both electromagnetic radiation and sound radiation as gravitational waves propagate outward from the collapsing core. While the energy of this co-produced electromagnetic and sound radiation is orders of magnitude smaller than the initiating gravitational radiation, the power may be sufficient to re-ignite fusion outside the collapsing core. The non-equilibrium re-ignition of fusion, in roughly the same time frame as the strongest neutrino emissions, would change the configuration of the pre-supernova star and subsequently the ejecta and the evolution of the stellar expansion of the supernova remnant. Although the co-produced electromagnetic or sound radiation could not contribute directly to the supernova explosion, the associated non-equilibrium re-ignition of fusion would alter the state outside the core leaving an observable signature in the ejecta of the supernova remnant. The aim of this paper is to argue that including this hypothesized co-produced radiation in computational models of core collapse supernovae would contribute to the evolution of the stellar expansion and consequently should be observable in the supernovae remnant, providing a confirmation of the conversion processes for gravitational radiation to electromagnetic and sound radiation.",

As an application, plane and spherical electromagnetic waves are projected in linearly accelerated frames in Minkowski space-time. We show that the amplitude, frequency and the wave vector of the plane wave in the accelerated frame vary with time, while the light speed remains constant.

The transfer matrix (T-matrix) of an object provides a complete description of its electromagnetic response. Once the T-matrices of the individual components of an ensemble are known, the electromagnetic response of the ensemble can be efficiently computed. This holds for arbitrary arrangements of large number of molecules, as well as for periodic arrays. We provide T-matrix based formulas for computing traditional chiro-optical properties like Circular Dichroism and Oriented Circular Dichroism, and also for quantifying electromagnetic duality and electromagnetic chirality, two properties that are fundamentally related to chiral interactions, and also technologically relevant. The formulas are valid for light-matter interactions of arbitrary high multipolar orders. We exemplify our approach by first computing the T-matrix of a cross-like arrangement of four copies of a chiral molecule from the time-dependent Hartree-Fock theory simulation data of the individual molecule, and then computing the aforementioned electromagnetic properties of both the cross and the individual molecule. The link that we establish is a necessary step towards obtaining T-matrix based constitutive relations of general bulk molecular materials from quantum mechanical simulations of their molecular constituents.",

Computations for the Sun-Jupiter-Saturn system, extending to the third order of the masses and to the 8th degree in the eccentricities and inclinations, reveal an unexpectedly sensitive dependence of the solution on initial data and its likely nonconvergence. The source of the sensitivity and apparent lack of convergence is this near-commensurability, the so-called great inequality. This indicates that simple averaging, still common in current semi-analytic planetary theories, may not be an adequate technique to obtain information on the long-term dynamics of the Solar System.   Preliminary results suggest that these difficulties can be overcome by using resonant normal forms.",

The LEP/SLC potential of probing universality violation is discussed in representative low-energy extensions of the Standard Model (SM) that could be derived by supersymmetric grand unified theories, such as the SM with left-handed and/or right-handed neutral isosinglets, the left-right symmetric model, and the minimal supersymmetric SM.",

A general framework to study these sums is established, and the connection between asymptotic growth of inverse determinant sums and the diversity-multiplexing gain trade-off is investigated. It is proven that the growth of the inverse determinant sum of a division algebra-based space-time code is completely determined by the growth of the unit group. This reduces the inverse determinant sum analysis to studying certain asymptotic integrals in Lie groups.   Using recent methods from ergodic theory, a complete classification of the inverse determinant sums of the most well known algebraic space-time codes is provided. The approach reveals an interesting and tight relation between diversity-multiplexing gain trade-off and point counting in Lie groups.",

While this problem is well understood under set semantics, it is by far less understood under bag semantics. In particular, it is a long-standing open question whether or not the conjunctive query containment problem under bag semantics is decidable. We unveil tight connections between information theory and the conjunctive query containment under bag semantics. These connections are established using information inequalities, which are considered to be the laws of information theory. Our first main result asserts that deciding the validity of maxima of information inequalities is many-one equivalent to the restricted case of conjunctive query containment in which the containing query is acyclic; thus, either both these problems are decidable or both are undecidable. Our second main result identifies a new decidable case of the conjunctive query containment problem under bag semantics. Specifically, we give an exponential time algorithm for conjunctive query containment under bag semantics, provided the containing query is chordal and admits a simple junction tree.",

This paper uses a classic four-strategy game to study the dynamic structure (non-Euclidean superplane cycle). The consistency is in significant between the three ways: (1) the analytical results from evolutionary dynamics equations, (2) agent-based simulation results from learning models and (3) laboratory results from human subjects game experiments.

      "abstract": "We show that in the search of a unified mean field description of finite nuclei and of nuclear and neutron matter even at high densities, the relativistic nuclear model derived from effective field theory and density functional theory methods constitutes a competitive framework. The model predicts a soft equation of state, owing to the additional meson interaction terms, consistently with the results of the microscopic Dirac-Brueckner-Hartree-Fock theory and recent experimental observations from heavy ion collisions. In finite systems, after inclusion of the pairing correlations, the model is able to describe both stable and exotic nuclei. We address two examples at the limits of the nuclear landscape. On the one hand, we analyze the giant halo effect and the isoscalar giant monopole resonance in very neutron-rich Zr isotopes. On the other hand, we discuss the structure of superheavy nuclei with double shell closures.",

We prove the following lifting properties of that functor: (1) There is no functor F, from simplicial monoids with order-unit with normalized positive homomorphisms to exchange rings, such that VF is equivalent to the identity. (2) There is no functor F, from simplicial monoids with order-unit with normalized positive embeddings to C*-algebras of real rank 0 (resp., von Neumann regular rings), such that VF is equivalent to the identity. (3) There is a {0,1}^3-indexed commutative diagram D of simplicial monoids that can be lifted, with respect to the functor V, by exchange rings and by C*-algebras of real rank 1, but not by semiprimitive exchange rings, thus neither by regular rings nor by C*-algebras of real rank 0. By using categorical tools from an earlier paper (larders, lifters, CLL), we deduce that there exists a unital exchange ring of cardinality aleph three (resp., an aleph three-separable unital C*-algebra of real rank 1) R, with stable rank 1 and index of nilpotence 2, such that V(R) is the positive cone of a dimension group and V(R) is not isomorphic to V(B) for any ring B which is either a C*-algebra of real rank 0 or a regular ring.",

Gauge invariant regularization of LF Hamiltonian via introducing a lattice in transverse coordinates and imposing periodic boundary conditions in LF coordinate $x^-$ for gauge fields on the interval $|x^-|< L$ is considered.

We attempt to predict regions of shape coexistence throughout the nuclear chart using the parameter-free proxy-SU(3) symmetry and standard covariant density functional theory. Within the proxy-SU(3) symmetry the interplay of shell model magic numbers, formed by the spin-orbit interaction, and the 3-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator magic numbers, leads to the prediction of specific horizontal and vertical stripes on the nuclear chart in which shape coexistence should be possible. Within covariant density functional theory, specific islands on the nuclear chart are found, in which particle-hole excitations leading to shape coexistence are observed. The role played by particle-hole excitations across magic numbers as well as the collapse of magic numbers as deformation sets in is clarified.",

Our theory enables efficient computation of functions of perturbed quantum states that assume only knowledge of the eigenspectrum of the zeroth order state and the density matrix elements of a zero-trace, Hermitian perturbation operator, not requiring analysis of the full state or the perturbation term. We develop theories for two classes of quantum state perturbations, perturbations that preserve the vector support of the original state and perturbations that extend the support beyond the support of the original state. We highlight relevant features of the two situations, in particular the fact that functions and measures of perturbed quantum states with preserved support can be elegantly and efficiently represented using Fréchet derivatives. We apply our perturbation theories to find simple expressions for four of the most important quantities in quantum information theory that are commonly computed from density matrices: the Von Neumann entropy, the quantum relative entropy, the quantum Chernoff bound, and the quantum fidelity.",

Calculations are performed for a wide range of neutron numbers, starting from the proton-rich side up to the neutron-rich side, by using the SLy4 Skyrme interaction and a new proposed formula for the pairing strength which is more precise for this region of nuclei as we did in previous works in the regions of Neodymium (Nd, Z=60) [Int. J. Mod. Phys. E 24, 1550073 (2015)] and Molybdenum (Mo, Z=42) [Nuc. Phys. A 957 22-32 (2017)]. Such a new pairing strength formula allows reaching exotic nuclei region where the experimental data are not available. Calculated values of various physical quantities such as binding energy, two-neutron separation energy, and rms-radii for protons and neutrons are discussed and compared with experimental data and some estimates of other nuclear models like Finite Range Droplet Model (FRDM), Relativistic Mean Field (RMF), Density-Dependent Meson-Exchange Relativistic Energy Functional (DD-ME2) and results of Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculations based on the D1S Gogny effective nucleon-nucleon interaction (Gogny D1S).",

When $Γ$ is arithmetic, this gives Hecke operators on the $K$-theory of certain $C^{*}$-algebras that are naturally associated with $Γ$. In this paper, we first study the topological $K$-theory of the arithmetic manifold associated to $Γ$. We prove that the Chern character commutes with Hecke operators. Afterwards, we show that the Shimura product of double cosets naturally corresponds to the Kasparov product and thus that the $KK$-groups associated to an arithmetic group $Γ$ become true Hecke modules. We conclude by discussing Hecke equivariant maps in $KK$-theory in great generality and apply this to the Borel-Serre compactification as well as various noncommutative compactifications associated with $Γ$. Along the way we discuss the relation between the $K$-theory and the integral cohomology of low-dimensional manifolds as Hecke modules.",

In this process, usually called adiabatic connection, the one-electron density is kept fixed by a suitable local one-body potential. The strong-interaction limit of density functional theory, defined as the limit $λ\\to\\infty$, turns out to be, like the opposite non-interacting Kohn-Sham limit ($λ\\to 0$) mathematically simpler than the physical ($λ=1$) case, and can be used to build an approximate interpolation formula between $λ\\to 0$ and $λ\\to\\infty$ for the exchange-correlation energy. Here we extend the exact treatment of the $λ\\to\\infty$ limit [Phys. Rev.

      "abstract": "Shame is often overlooked in therapy in favour of anxiety and guilt (Lansky & Morrison, 1998; Solomon, 2021). Indeed, there is little emphasis on shame within psycho- therapy training and a noticeable lack of recognition to its relationship with attachment (Solomon, 2021). And yet, shame is described as an attachment emotion by some shame theorists (Lewis, 1971; Schore, 1991). Shame is a complex emotion that is often hidden, making it difficult to work with and can leave clients feeling frustrated that they are stuck in the same relational patterns. Ultimately, unacknowledged shame in the therapy room and the understanding of how shame influences self-perception can be detrimental to thera- peutic outcome. This article introduces a new theory of shame: shame containment theory (SCT). The premise being that shame is vital to self-protection and attachment. By exploring the history of shame in psychoanalytic psychotherapy and presenting current models of shame, this article will demonstrate how SCT is a needed addition to contemporary shame theory, with particular relevance to attachment theory. Using a brief case study, this article will demonstrate how SCT relates to presentations in the therapy room. This lens on shame as an attachment emotion offers therapists a new model with which to understand and work with shame.",

The theory proposes that outer and inner containment hold adolescents back from delinquency even when external factors pull and push them toward it. This early control theory was ahead of its time, but never received the empirical attention it deserves. This article outlines the core theoretical concepts and the basic propositions in order to empirically examine their validity. We employed hybrid linear regression analysis using longitudinal survey data of 612 adolescents (12–18 years old) in the city of The Hague, the Netherlands. The results indicate that outer and inner containment can be meaningfully distinguished, and that several but not all propositions of the theory are supported. Inner and outer containment function as a buffer against external pulls and are able to counteract the effect of increases in environmental pulls during adolescence. We conclude that containment theory is still a promising interaction theory that can help us understand why adolescents who experience external pulls toward delinquency are able to resist these influences.",

A two-level cooperative control architecture is proposed to achieve a containment formation. At the kinematic level, distributed guidance laws and path update laws are developed for mobile robots and virtual leaders, respectively. Containment maneuvering errors are involved in the path update laws design to enforce the coordination between mobile robots and virtual leaders. At the kinetic level, two extended state observers are utilized to estimate the unknown uncertainties existing in surge and yaw dynamics. Then, antidisturbance kinetic control laws are developed through the estimated uncertainties. By using the proposed controllers, the states of mobile robots not only converge to the convex hull spanned by multiple virtual leaders, but also keep a certain formation pattern specified by the convex combination of virtual leaders. The input-to-state stability of the closed-loop path-guided containment maneuvering system is analyzed through Lyapunov theory. The effectiveness of the presented method is verified via experiment on CSICET-MR01 mobile robots.",

      "abstract": "In this article, a novel class of containment maneuvering controllers is developed for a fleet of marine surface vehicles (MSVs) capable of tracking a parameterized path within finite time. Besides, the along-track errors and cross-track errors of parameterized line-of-sight (LOS) are constrained. For kinematic level, to address tracking error constraints and finite time convergence, the coordinated guidance laws are derived by developing LOS based tan-type barrier Lyapunov functions (BLFs), nonlinear tracking differentiator (NLTD) and finite-time theory. Specifically, a novel finite-time extended state observer (FTESO) is developed to estimate the uncertain kinematics. For coordination level, the finite-time switching threshold event-triggered containment control strategy for MSV is derived to reduce the updating frequency of the path variables containment controller. Theoretical analysis illustrates that all signals are ultimately uniformly bounded (UUB). Both simulation and experimental results are provided to verify the effective performance of the proposed containment maneuvering strategy.",

      "abstract": "Formation-containment control problems for multiple multirotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems with directed topologies are studied, where the states of leaders form desired formation and the states of followers converge to the convex hull spanned by those of the leaders. First, formation-containment protocols are constructed based on the neighboring information of UAVs. Then, sufficient conditions for multi-UAV systems to achieve formation-containment are presented. An explicit expression to describe the relationship among the states of followers, the time-varying formation for the leaders and the formation reference is derived. It is shown that the states of followers not only converge to the convex hull formed by those of leaders but also keep certain formation specified by the convex combination of the formation for the leaders. Moreover, an approach to determine the gain matrices of the formation-containment protocol is proposed by solving an algebraic Riccati equation. Finally, a formation-containment platform with five quadrotor UAVs is introduced, and both the simulation and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the obtained results. Note to Practitioners—This paper addresses the problem of formation-containment control for multi-UAV systems over directed topologies. In practical applications, there may exist multiple leaders and multiple followers in a multi-UAV system. Formation-containment means that the states of leaders form the desired time-varying formation and at the same time the states of the followers converge to the convex hull spanned by those of the leaders. Formation-containment control provides a unified framework for formation control and containment control, and has potential applications in the cooperative source seeking, load transportation, and surveillance. Although formation control and containment control problems have been studied a lot, the formation-containment control problem for multi-UAV system is still open and challenging. This paper proposed a distributed formation-containment protocol for the multi-UAV system using local neighboring information. Sufficient conditions for multi-UAV systems to achieve formation-containment are presented. It is proven that the states of followers not only converge to the convex hull formed by those of leaders but also keep certain formation specified by the convex combination of the formation for the leaders. An approach to design the formation-containment protocol is given. A remarkable point for this paper is that the obtained results are demonstrated by practical experiments with five quadrotor UAVs.",

Firstly, based on the concept of probability of containment in search theory, a task area division method for polygonal and circular areas is constructed, and the corresponding search trajectory is constructed. Then, the influence of factors, including probability of containment, probability of detection, and probability of success on search efficiency, is sorted out, and the objective function of search trajectory optimization is constructed. Subsequently, an adaptive mutation operator is used to improve the differential evolution algorithm, thus constructing a trajectory optimization process based on the improved adaptive differential evolution algorithm. Through simulation verification, the proposed method can achieve a full coverage search of the task area and a rapid search within a limited time, and can prioritize the coverage of areas with a high target existence probability as much as possible to achieve a higher cumulative success probability. Moreover, the time efficiency and accuracy of the solution are high.",

There exist the individual tasks of networked ASVs and virtual leaders beyond the overall goal. The containment control can be transformed into a noncooperative game problem to balance individual and group objectives. With the noncooperative game theory, the containment task is reformulated as a Nash equilibrium seeking problem of networked ASVs regarded as players. To achieve the Nash equilibrium seeking of ASVs, a noncooperative-game-based fault-tolerant fuzzy containment controller is developed for networked ASVs with an adaptive compensation technique. First, a fuzzy predictor based on the high-order tuner is constructed to tackle the total disturbances. Next, a parameter estimator for unknown faults is designed using the adaptive compensation strategy. With identified disturbances and faults, a desired control law and an intermediate control variable are developed to enable ASVs to operate effectively despite faults. By the Lyapunov functions, theoretical results show that the actions of ASVs can converge to the neighborhood region of the Nash equilibrium. Finally, simulation results are presented to demonstrate the validity of the proposed fault-tolerant containment control method.",

Furthermore, the continuous protocols are also presented to avoid undesirable chattering from the tracking leader’s nonzero input, under which the errors are uniformly ultimately bounded and the upper bound of errors can be made arbitrarily small. In the end, simulation example verifies the feasibility of the desired theoretical results.",

We look to apply the theory in analyzing intervention and containment policies to use against emerging-state actors, using the Islamic State of Syria & Iraqi (ISIS) as the case study. We show utility across four military applications of simulation: understanding, forecasting and responding to adversary and societal behavior; understanding enemy command and control structures; and analyzing, forecasting and planning courses-of-action (COA). To do this, we created two baseline scenarios—one replicating the historical foreign intervention against ISIS and a counter-factual where no foreign intervention occurred. We then conducted a suite of experiments on contemporary military intervention policies in isolation, combination, at different timing windows and under hypothetical “best case” conditions as well as operationally constrained. Insights of these experiments’ tests include the influence of ethnographic envelopes, timing windows, the importance of actor legitimacy and the marginally diminishing returns of combat actions. Finally, we test a policy based on emerging-state actor theory incorporating these insights against the contemporary policies, historical baseline and two falsification policies. The emerging-state actor COA performs significantly better than others. Our research contributes a simulation, called the Emerging-State Actor Model (E-SAM). This simulation includes military, economic, political, social and information aspects (known asDIME-PMESII simulations) for both researchers and military planners concerned with irregular conflict.",

A fully distributed adaptive observer is created for each follower in accordance with the communication topology information among agents. This observer is designed to estimate the convex combination information of the leaders. The approach utilizes interval type‐2 fuzzy set theory and adaptive methods to design a distributed containment control strategy that only uses the self‐information of the followers and neighbor nodes' information. Sufficient conditions for implementing containment control are given. A new Lyapunov‐Krasovskii functional (LKF) is constructed, and the stability of the system with feedback loop is proven using fractional‐order theory and inequality methods.

Although the followers cannot obtain the given tracking information directly, they can obtain the corresponding information from leaders and other followers through the communication network based on the graph theory. In terms of this case, a distributed formation-containment (FC) control method is proposed to handle the related flight problems. We aim to develop a formation control for the leader QUAVs and a containment control for the follower QUAVs with the graph theory. Furthermore, a neural network (NN) technique is utilized to cope with the uncertainty of each QUAV. In order to guarantee good flight performance when tracking, the finite-time stability theorem is introduced into the control design to make each QUAV achieve satisfactory tacking performance in finite time. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted in the platform of two-layer 16 QUAVs to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed NN-based finite-time FC control.",

This article investigates the problem of containment for a weighted multiagent network with continuous-time agents under state constraints. The network is composed of uninformed and informed agents, where the latter receive external inputs. A new general class of distributed nonlinear controllers is designed for accomplishing both containment and consensus tracking, where the state of each agent is required to stay in its desired convex constraint set. We show that, by using matrix analysis, convex analysis, and Lyapunov theory, all agents eventually converge to the convex hull formed by the external inputs while they obey their constraints during the transience. No relationship is assumed between the convex hull and the intersection of all constraint sets. The consensus tracking problem with a single external input is also solved under this framework. As a generalization, we tackle the multiscaled constrained containment problem, where agents can specify their desired buffer zones by either zooming in or zooming out the convex hull.

A new nonlinear transformation function (NTF) is proposed, which serves as a unified tool for coping with the systems subjected to state constraints and no constraint. By combing the variable transformation with the proposed NTF, the original systems with state constraints are converted into the equivalent free-constrained systems. Moreover, as long as the boundedness of the states in transformed systems is guaranteed, the states of the original MAS do not transgress the preassigned boundaries. Based on the finite-time stability theory, the adaptive fuzzy control scheme is constructed for the transformed systems. It is proved that the outputs of all the followers are driven to converge to the convex hull spanned by the leaders in a finite time, and all the signals in the closed-loop systems are bounded in sense of mean square. The full state constraints for the followers are not violated all the time. Especially, the control structure does not need to change even there is no constraint imposes on the state. Finally, simulation examples are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed finite-time control scheme.",

Via applying the mean-value theorem, the difficulty of the controller design generated by the nonaffine nonlinear term is overcome. A neural network (NN) is employed to approximate the ideal input signal instead of the unknown nonaffine function, then a distributed adaptive NN bipartite containment control for the FOMASs is developed under the backstepping structure.

Firstly, the collision avoidance problem considered in this paper is addressed by exploiting a consensus-like interconnection on a directed graph and an error transformation function. Then, on the basis of the optimal backstepping technique, a single critic neural network is adopted to obtain the solution of the coupled Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equation, in which an improved learning mechanism is constructed to relax the requirement on initial control conditions. In addition, based on the Lyapunov stability theory, it is proved that all signals in the closed-loop optimal control are uniformly ultimately bounded.

Meanwhile, an auxiliary system with the same order as the considered system is skillfully introduced into the backstepping control method to overcome the problem of input saturation. By constructing an adaptive command filter with error compensation mechanism, the problems of the computation burden and filtering errors are solved simultaneously. Moreover, the output signals of followers can converge into the convex hull spanned by multiple dynamic leaders which are controlled by a human operator.

Inspired by recent applications of NI and passivity‐based control techniques in the multi‐agent systems (MAS) domain, a new formation‐tracking and containment control scheme is developed for a class of networked multi‐UAV systems. The proposed scheme offers a two‐stage and two‐loop control configuration where the inner loop uses a cascaded PID controller to ensure stable hovering of the UAVs, and the outer loop deploys a distributed “mixed” SNI and strictly passive controller to achieve the formation‐containment objectives. This scheme works with a dynamic output feedback control strategy; hence, it offers advantages when the full‐state measurement is not possible. In contrast to the well‐known Lyapunov theory‐based cooperative control schemes, the present one exploits the characteristic loci technique to prove the formation‐tracking and containment phenomena theoretically.

We consider here the analogue of Ehrenfeucht's lemma for models of set theory. The original argument applies directly to the ordinal-definable elements of any model of set theory, and in particular, Ehrenfeucht's lemma holds fully for models of set theory satisfying $V=HOD$. We show that the lemma can fail, however, in models of set theory with $V\\neq HOD$, and it necessarily fails in the forcing extension to add a generic Cohen real. We go on to formulate a scheme of natural parametric generalizations of Ehrenfeucht's lemma, namely, the principles of the form $EL(A,P,Q)$, which asserts that whenever an object $b$ is definable from some $a\\in A$ using parameters in $P$, with $b\\neq a$, then the types of $a$ and $b$ over $Q$ are different. We also consider various analogues of Ehrenfeucht's lemma obtained by using algebraicity in place of definability, where a set $b$ is algebraic in $a$ if it is a member of a finite set definable from $a$ (as in Hamkins, Leahy arXiv:1305.5953). Ehrenfeucht's lemma holds for the ordinal-algebraic sets, we prove, if and only if the ordinal-algebraic and ordinal-definable sets coincide. Using similar analysis, we answer two open questions posed by Hamkins and Leahy, by showing that (i) algebraicity and definability need not coincide in models of set theory and (ii) the internal and external notions of being ordinal algebraic need not coincide.",

In this paper, we target a more challenging and realistic setting: open-set learning (OSL), where there exist test samples from the classes that are unseen during training. Although researchers have designed many methods from the algorithmic perspectives, there are few methods that provide generalization guarantees on their ability to achieve consistent performance on different training samples drawn from the same distribution. Motivated by the transfer learning and probably approximate correct (PAC) theory, we make a bold attempt to study OSL by proving its generalization error-given training samples with size n, the estimation error will get close to order O_p(1/\\sqrt{n}). This is the first study to provide a generalization bound for OSL, which we do by theoretically investigating the risk of the target classifier on unknown classes. According to our theory, a novel algorithm, called auxiliary open-set risk (AOSR) is proposed to address the OSL problem. Experiments verify the efficacy of AOSR.

Lyot-filter emerges as a potential device for multi-wavelength generation application. However, because of the high birefringence of polarization maintaining fiber in Lyot-filter, it is difficult to generate broadband dual-wavelength or multi-wavelength mode-locked fiber laser by using common Lyot-filter. In this paper, for the first time, we propose an idea of using the low birefringence induced by bending the single-mode fiber to form a Lyot-filter for dual-wavelength mode-locked fiber laser generation. The dual-wavelength output centers at 1532 and 1556 nm and it may simplify the set-up for dual-wavelength mode-locked laser.",

Despite its growing prominence, a comprehensive survey of soft set theory, encompassing its foundational concepts, developments, and applications, is notably absent in the existing literature. We aim to bridge this gap. This survey delves into the basic elements of the theory, including the notion of a soft set, the operations on soft sets, and their semantic interpretations. It describes various generalizations and modifications of soft set theory, such as N-soft sets, fuzzy soft sets, and bipolar soft sets, highlighting their specific characteristics. Furthermore, this work outlines the fundamentals of various extensions of mathematical structures from the perspective of soft set theory. Particularly, we present basic results of soft topology and other algebraic structures such as soft algebras and σ\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \\usepackage{amsmath} \\usepackage{wasysym} \\usepackage{amsfonts} \\usepackage{amssymb} \\usepackage{amsbsy} \\usepackage{mathrsfs} \\usepackage{upgreek} \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \\begin{document}$$\\sigma$$\\end{document}-algebras. This article examines a selection of notable applications of soft set theory in different fields, including medicine and economics, underscoring its versatile nature. The survey concludes with a discussion on the challenges and future directions in soft set theory, emphasizing the need for further research to enhance its theoretical foundations and broaden its practical applications. Overall, this survey of soft set theory serves as a valuable resource for practitioners, researchers, and students interested in understanding and utilizing this flexible mathematical framework for tackling uncertainty in decision-making processes.",

At the most basic level, a set can be defined as a group of elements that share certain characteristics. For George Lakoff and Rafael Núñez, one way to see sets is as a “containerlike entity” (Lakoff and Núñez 2000, 140) and James Mahoney describes sets as “boundaries that define zones of inclusion and exclusion” (Mahoney 2010, 7). Given these understandings, it is apparent that sets and concepts are closely interlinked. In fact, most social science theories are grounded in set theory, either explicitly by using the language of necessary and sufficient conditions, or implicitly by invoking the set-theoretic logic without expressly referring to necessity and sufficiency (Goertz and Mahoney 2012; Schneider and Wagemann 2012).2",

      "abstract": "Mind-set refers to people’s beliefs about whether attributes are malleable (growth mind-set) or unchangeable ( fixed mind-set). Proponents of mind-set theory have made bold claims about mind-set’s importance. For example, one’s mind-set is described as having profound effects on one’s motivation and achievements, creating different psychological worlds for people, and forming the core of people’s meaning systems. We examined the evidentiary strength of six key premises of mind-set theory in 438 participants; we reasoned that strongly worded claims should be supported by equally strong evidence. However, no support was found for most premises. All associations (rs) were significantly weaker than .20. Other achievement-motivation constructs, such as self-efficacy and need for achievement, have been found to correlate much more strongly with presumed associates of mind-set. The strongest association with mind-set (r = −.12) was opposite from the predicted direction. The results suggest that the foundations of mind-set theory are not firm and that bold claims about mind-set appear to be overstated.",

      "abstract": "Since the future of the society depends upon the role of students and their services construct the prosperous and advanced society, so suitable career selection for the students' is considered to be an important problem to explore. As per psychology, if a student has the required capability, and positive attitudes towards a subject in terms of interest, attitude, memory, knowledge, environment, and career, then the student will achieve more in that subject. To consider this kind of uncertain issues, picture fuzzy set and rough set are found to be appropriate due to their inherent characteristics to deal with incomplete and imprecise information. In this study, picture fuzzy set and rough set-based approaches are proposed to help the student to choose an appropriate subject and consequently provide a good service or contribution to the society particularly in that domain. The main purpose of the article is to analyse student's features in terms of career, memory, interest, knowledge, environment and attitude and then predict the appropriate stream for making the career comfortable so that the student can conveniently explore much in that area. To select students' career, a hybridized distance measure under picture fuzzy environment is proposed where the evaluating information regarding students, subjects and student's features are given in picture fuzzy numbers. In this paper, two types of hybridization approaches are proposed which are the hybridization of Hausdorff and Hamming distance measures and hybridization of Hausdorff and Euclidean distance measures. Next, we apply rough set theory to determine whether a particular subject is appropriate for a student even if there is controversy to select a stream. Lower and higher approximation with boundary region of rough set theory is used to manage inconsistency situations. Finally, two case studies are demonstrated to validate the applicability of the proposed idea.",

The artificial neural networks are presented with brief introduction to error-correction rules, Boltzmann learning, Hebbian rule, competitive learning rule, and deep learning. The instance-based learning is treated in details with its algorithm and learning task. The chapter concludes with a summary, and a set of practice exercises.",

Building on an abstract understanding of this process of combination, this book constructs a new theory of epistemic probability. The theory draws on the work of A. P. Dempster but diverges from Depster's viewpoint by identifying his \"lower probabilities\" as epistemic probabilities and taking his rule for combining \"upper and lower probabilities\" as fundamental. The book opens with a critique of the well-known Bayesian theory of epistemic probability. It then proceeds to develop an alternative to the additive set functions and the rule of conditioning of the Bayesian theory: set functions that need only be what Choquet called \"monotone of order of infinity.\" and Dempster's rule for combining such set functions. This rule, together with the idea of \"weights of evidence,\" leads to both an extensive new theory and a better understanding of the Bayesian theory. The book concludes with a brief treatment of statistical inference and a discussion of the limitations of epistemic probability. Appendices contain mathematical proofs, which are relatively elementary and seldom depend on mathematics more advanced that the binomial theorem.",

An overall framework using the circle is proposed and introduced followed by a more detailed and elaborated illustration using the four directions. The article identifies the need to articulate Indigenous wholistic theory and does so by employing a wholistic framework of the four directional circle. It then systematically moves around each direction, beginning in the east where a discussion of Spirit and Vision occurs. In the south a discussion of relationships, community and heart emerge. The western direction brings forth a discussion of the spirit of the ancestors and importance of Indigenous knowledge and Indigenous knowledge production. The northern direction articulates ideas surrounding healing and movements and actions that guide practice. Finally, the article begins with a discussion on all four directions together with a final examination of the center fire where all elements interconnect and intersect. Lastly, the article proclaims the existence of Indigenous wholistic theory as a necessary knowledge set for practice.",

      "abstract": "We analyze the impact of a proposed tidal instability coupling $p$-modes and $g$-modes within neutron stars on GW170817. This non-resonant instability transfers energy from the orbit of the binary to internal modes of the stars, accelerating the gravitational-wave driven inspiral. We model the impact of this instability on the phasing of the gravitational wave signal using three parameters per star: an overall amplitude, a saturation frequency, and a spectral index. Incorporating these additional parameters, we compute the Bayes Factor ($\\ln B^{pg}_{!pg}$) comparing our $p$-$g$ model to a standard one. We find that the observed signal is consistent with waveform models that neglect $p$-$g$ effects, with $\\ln B^{pg}_{!pg} = 0.03^{+0.70}_{-0.58}$ (maximum a posteriori and 90% credible region). By injecting simulated signals that do not include $p$-$g$ effects and recovering them with the $p$-$g$ model, we show that there is a $\\simeq 50\\%$ probability of obtaining similar $\\ln B^{pg}_{!pg}$ even when $p$-$g$ effects are absent. We find that the $p$-$g$ amplitude for 1.4 $M_\\odot$ neutron stars is constrained to $\\lesssim \\text{few}\\times10^{-7}$, with maxima a posteriori near $\\sim 10^{-7}$ and $p$-$g$ saturation frequency $\\sim 70\\, \\mathrm{Hz}$. This suggests that there are less than a few hundred excited modes, assuming they all saturate by wave breaking. For comparison, theoretical upper bounds suggest a $p$-$g$ amplitude $\\lesssim 10^{-6}$ and $\\lesssim 10^{3}$ modes saturating by wave breaking. Thus, the measured constraints only rule out extreme values of the $p$-$g$ parameters. They also imply that the instability dissipates $\\lesssim 10^{51}\\, \\mathrm{ergs}$ over the entire inspiral, i.e., less than a few percent of the energy radiated as gravitational waves.",

      "abstract": "A detailed study is presented of the expected performance of the ATLAS detector. The reconstruction of tracks, leptons, photons, missing energy and jets is investigated, together with the performance of b-tagging and the trigger. The physics potential for a variety of interesting physics processes, within the Standard Model and beyond, is examined. The study comprises a series of notes based on simulations of the detector and physics processes, with particular emphasis given to the data expected from the first years of operation of the LHC at CERN.",

      "abstract": "A joint measurement is presented of the branching fractions $B^0_s\\toμ^+μ^-$ and $B^0\\toμ^+μ^-$ in proton-proton collisions at the LHC by the CMS and LHCb experiments. The data samples were collected in 2011 at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV, and in 2012 at 8 TeV. The combined analysis produces the first observation of the $B^0_s\\toμ^+μ^-$ decay, with a statistical significance exceeding six standard deviations, and the best measurement of its branching fraction so far. Furthermore, evidence for the $B^0\\toμ^+μ^-$ decay is obtained with a statistical significance of three standard deviations. The branching fraction measurements are statistically compatible with SM predictions and impose stringent constraints on several theories beyond the SM.",

      "abstract": "The Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo observatories recently discovered gravitational waves from a binary neutron star inspiral. A short gamma-ray burst (GRB) that followed the merger of this binary was also recorded by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (Fermi-GBM), and the Anticoincidence Shield for the Spectrometer for the International Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory (INTEGRAL), indicating particle acceleration by the source. The precise location of the event was determined by optical detections of emission following the merger. We searched for high-energy neutrinos from the merger in the GeV--EeV energy range using the ANTARES, IceCube, and Pierre Auger Observatories. No neutrinos directionally coincident with the source were detected within $\\pm500$ s around the merger time. Additionally, no MeV neutrino burst signal was detected coincident with the merger. We further carried out an extended search in the direction of the source for high-energy neutrinos within the 14-day period following the merger, but found no evidence of emission. We used these results to probe dissipation mechanisms in relativistic outflows driven by the binary neutron star merger. The non-detection is consistent with model predictions of short GRBs observed at a large off-axis angle.",

      "abstract": "Branching fraction ratios between the decays $B^{0}_{(s)} \\rightarrow J/ψη^{(\\prime)}$ are measured using proton-proton collision data collected by the LHCb experiment at centre-of-mass energies of $7$, $8$ and $13~\\textrm{TeV}$, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $9~ \\textrm{fb}^{-1}$. The measured ratios of these branching fractions are $\\frac{BF(B^{0} \\rightarrow J/ψη^{\\prime})}{BF(B^{0} \\rightarrow J/ψη)} = 0.48 \\pm 0.06 \\pm 0.02 \\pm 0.01$ and $\\frac{BF(B^{0}_{s} \\rightarrow J/ψη^{\\prime})}{BF(B^{0}_{s} \\rightarrow J/ψη)} = 0.80 \\pm 0.02 \\pm 0.02 \\pm 0.01$, where the uncertainties are statistical, systematic and related to the precision of the $η^{(\\prime)}$ branching fractions, respectively. They are used to constrain the $η/η^{\\prime}$ mixing angle, $φ_{P}$, and to probe the presence of a possible glueball component in the $η^{\\prime}$ meson, described by the gluonic mixing angle $φ_{G}$. The obtained results are $φ_{P} = (41.6^{+1.0}_{-1.2})^\\circ$ and $φ_{G} = (28.1^{+3.9}_{-4.0})^\\circ$, where the uncertainties are statistically dominated. While the value of $φ_{P}$ is compatible with existing experimental determinations and theoretical calculations, the angle $φ_{G}$ differs from zero by more than four standard deviations, which points to a substantial glueball component in the $η^{\\prime}$ meson and/or unexpectedly large contributions from gluon-mediated processes in these decays. The absolute branching fractions are also measured relative to that of the well-established $B^{0}_{s} \\rightarrow J/ψφ$ decay, which serves as the normalisation channel. These results supersede the previous LHCb measurements and are the most precise to date.",

      "abstract": "In response to the 2020 Update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics, the Future Circular Collider (FCC) Feasibility Study was launched as an international collaboration hosted by CERN. This report describes the FCC integrated programme, which consists of two stages: an electron-positron collider (FCC-ee) in the first phase, serving as a high-luminosity Higgs, top, and electroweak factory; followed by a proton-proton collider (FCC-hh) at the energy frontier in the second phase.   FCC-ee is designed to operate at four key centre-of-mass energies: the Z pole, the WW production threshold, the ZH production peak, and the top/anti-top production threshold - delivering the highest possible luminosities to four experiments. Over 15 years of operation, FCC-ee will produce more than 6 trillion Z bosons, 200 million WW pairs, nearly 3 million Higgs bosons, and 2 million top anti-top pairs. Precise energy calibration at the Z pole and WW threshold will be achieved through frequent resonant depolarisation of pilot bunches. The sequence of operation modes remains flexible.   FCC-hh will operate at a centre-of-mass energy of approximately 85 TeV - nearly an order of magnitude higher than the LHC - and is designed to deliver 5 to 10 times the integrated luminosity of the HL-LHC. Its mass reach for direct discovery extends to several tens of TeV. In addition to proton-proton collisions, FCC-hh is capable of supporting ion-ion, ion-proton, and lepton-hadron collision modes.   This second volume of the Feasibility Study Report presents the complete design of the FCC-ee collider, its operation and staging strategy, the full-energy booster and injector complex, required accelerator technologies, safety concepts, and technical infrastructure. It also includes the design of the FCC-hh hadron collider, development of high-field magnets, hadron injector options, and key technical systems for FCC-hh.",

      "abstract": "Volume 3 of the FCC Feasibility Report presents studies related to civil engineering, the development of a project implementation scenario, and environmental and sustainability aspects. The report details the iterative improvements made to the civil engineering concepts since 2018, taking into account subsurface conditions, accelerator and experiment requirements, and territorial considerations. It outlines a technically feasible and economically viable civil engineering configuration that serves as the baseline for detailed subsurface investigations, construction design, cost estimation, and project implementation planning. Additionally, the report highlights ongoing subsurface investigations in key areas to support the development of an improved 3D subsurface model of the region.   The report describes development of the project scenario based on the 'avoid-reduce-compensate' iterative optimisation approach. The reference scenario balances optimal physics performance with territorial compatibility, implementation risks, and costs. Environmental field investigations covering almost 600 hectares of terrain - including numerous urban, economic, social, and technical aspects - confirmed the project's technical feasibility and contributed to the preparation of essential input documents for the formal project authorisation phase. The summary also highlights the initiation of public dialogue as part of the authorisation process. The results of a comprehensive socio-economic impact assessment, which included significant environmental effects, are presented. Even under the most conservative and stringent conditions, a positive benefit-cost ratio for the FCC-ee is obtained. Finally, the report provides a concise summary of the studies conducted to document the current state of the environment.",

      "abstract": "Volume 1 of the FCC Feasibility Report presents an overview of the physics case, experimental programme, and detector concepts for the Future Circular Collider (FCC). This volume outlines how FCC would address some of the most profound open questions in particle physics, from precision studies of the Higgs and EW bosons and of the top quark, to the exploration of physics beyond the Standard Model. The report reviews the experimental opportunities offered by the staged implementation of FCC, beginning with an electron-positron collider (FCC-ee), operating at several centre-of-mass energies, followed by a hadron collider (FCC-hh). Benchmark examples are given of the expected physics performance, in terms of precision and sensitivity to new phenomena, of each collider stage. Detector requirements and conceptual designs for FCC-ee experiments are discussed, as are the specific demands that the physics programme imposes on the accelerator in the domains of the calibration of the collision energy, and the interface region between the accelerator and the detector. The report also highlights advances in detector, software and computing technologies, as well as the theoretical tools /reconstruction techniques that will enable the precision measurements and discovery potential of the FCC experimental programme. This volume reflects the outcome of a global collaborative effort involving hundreds of scientists and institutions, aided by a dedicated community-building coordination, and provides a targeted assessment of the scientific opportunities and experimental foundations of the FCC programme.",

      "abstract": "Astrophysical sources of gravitational waves, such as binary neutron star and black hole mergers or core-collapse supernovae, can drive relativistic outflows, giving rise to non-thermal high-energy emission. High-energy neutrinos are signatures of such outflows. The detection of gravitational waves and high-energy neutrinos from common sources could help establish the connection between the dynamics of the progenitor and the properties of the outflow. We searched for associated emission of gravitational waves and high-energy neutrinos from astrophysical transients with minimal assumptions using data from Advanced LIGO from its first observing run O1, and data from the ANTARES and IceCube neutrino observatories from the same time period. We focused on candidate events whose astrophysical origin could not be determined from a single messenger. We found no significant coincident candidate, which we used to constrain the rate density of astrophysical sources dependent on their gravitational wave and neutrino emission processes.",

      "abstract": "We describe a search for gravitational waves from compact binaries with at least one component with mass 0.2 $M_\\odot$ -- $1.0 M_\\odot$ and mass ratio $q \\geq 0.1$ in Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo data collected between 1 November 2019, 15:00 UTC and 27 March 2020, 17:00 UTC. No signals were detected. The most significant candidate has a false alarm rate of 0.2 $\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. We estimate the sensitivity of our search over the entirety of Advanced LIGO's and Advanced Virgo's third observing run, and present the most stringent limits to date on the merger rate of binary black holes with at least one subsolar-mass component. We use the upper limits to constrain two fiducial scenarios that could produce subsolar-mass black holes: primordial black holes (PBH) and a model of dissipative dark matter. The PBH model uses recent prescriptions for the merger rate of PBH binaries that include a rate suppression factor to effectively account for PBH early binary disruptions. If the PBHs are monochromatically distributed, we can exclude a dark matter fraction in PBHs $f_\\mathrm{PBH} \\gtrsim 0.6$ (at 90% confidence) in the probed subsolar-mass range. However, if we allow for broad PBH mass distributions we are unable to rule out $f_\\mathrm{PBH} = 1$. For the dissipative model, where the dark matter has chemistry that allows a small fraction to cool and collapse into black holes, we find an upper bound $f_{\\mathrm{DBH}} < 10^{-5}$ on the fraction of atomic dark matter collapsed into black holes.",

      "abstract": "Among the various candidates for dark matter (DM), ultralight vector DM can be probed by laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors through the measurement of oscillating length changes in the arm cavities. In this context, KAGRA has a unique feature due to differing compositions of its mirrors, enhancing the signal of vector DM in the length change in the auxiliary channels. Here we present the result of a search for $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge boson DM using the KAGRA data from auxiliary length channels during the first joint observation run together with GEO600. By applying our search pipeline, which takes into account the stochastic nature of ultralight DM, upper bounds on the coupling strength between the $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge boson and ordinary matter are obtained for a range of DM masses. While our constraints are less stringent than those derived from previous experiments, this study demonstrates the applicability of our method to the lower-mass vector DM search, which is made difficult in this measurement by the short observation time compared to the auto-correlation time scale of DM.",

      "abstract": "Gravitational lensing by massive objects along the line of sight to the source causes distortions of gravitational wave-signals; such distortions may reveal information about fundamental physics, cosmology and astrophysics. In this work, we have extended the search for lensing signatures to all binary black hole events from the third observing run of the LIGO--Virgo network. We search for repeated signals from strong lensing by 1) performing targeted searches for subthreshold signals, 2) calculating the degree of overlap amongst the intrinsic parameters and sky location of pairs of signals, 3) comparing the similarities of the spectrograms amongst pairs of signals, and 4) performing dual-signal Bayesian analysis that takes into account selection effects and astrophysical knowledge. We also search for distortions to the gravitational waveform caused by 1) frequency-independent phase shifts in strongly lensed images, and 2) frequency-dependent modulation of the amplitude and phase due to point masses. None of these searches yields significant evidence for lensing. Finally, we use the non-detection of gravitational-wave lensing to constrain the lensing rate based on the latest merger-rate estimates and the fraction of dark matter composed of compact objects.",

      "abstract": "We present the results of a model-based search for continuous gravitational waves from the low-mass X-ray binary Scorpius X-1 using LIGO detector data from the third observing run of Advanced LIGO, Advanced Virgo and KAGRA. This is a semicoherent search which uses details of the signal model to coherently combine data separated by less than a specified coherence time, which can be adjusted to balance sensitivity with computing cost. The search covered a range of gravitational-wave frequencies from 25Hz to 1600Hz, as well as ranges in orbital speed, frequency and phase determined from observational constraints. No significant detection candidates were found, and upper limits were set as a function of frequency. The most stringent limits, between 100Hz and 200Hz, correspond to an amplitude h0 of about 1e-25 when marginalized isotropically over the unknown inclination angle of the neutron star's rotation axis, or less than 4e-26 assuming the optimal orientation. The sensitivity of this search is now probing amplitudes predicted by models of torque balance equilibrium. For the usual conservative model assuming accretion at the surface of the neutron star, our isotropically-marginalized upper limits are close to the predicted amplitude from about 70Hz to 100Hz; the limits assuming the neutron star spin is aligned with the most likely orbital angular momentum are below the conservative torque balance predictions from 40Hz to 200Hz. Assuming a broader range of accretion models, our direct limits on gravitational-wave amplitude delve into the relevant parameter space over a wide range of frequencies, to 500Hz or more.",

      "abstract": "Continuous gravitational waves (CWs) emission from neutron stars carries information about their internal structure and equation of state, and it can provide tests of General Relativity. We present a search for CWs from a set of 45 known pulsars in the first part of the fourth LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA observing run, known as O4a. We conducted a targeted search for each pulsar using three independent analysis methods considering the single-harmonic and the dual-harmonic emission models. We find no evidence of a CW signal in O4a data for both models and set upper limits on the signal amplitude and on the ellipticity, which quantifies the asymmetry in the neutron star mass distribution. For the single-harmonic emission model, 29 targets have the upper limit on the amplitude below the theoretical spin-down limit. The lowest upper limit on the amplitude is $6.4\\!\\times\\!10^{-27}$ for the young energetic pulsar J0537-6910, while the lowest constraint on the ellipticity is $8.8\\!\\times\\!10^{-9}$ for the bright nearby millisecond pulsar J0437-4715. Additionally, for a subset of 16 targets we performed a narrowband search that is more robust regarding the emission model, with no evidence of a signal. We also found no evidence of non-standard polarizations as predicted by the Brans-Dicke theory.",

      "abstract": "The Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC) is a collection of short-duration (transient) gravitational wave signals identified by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration in gravitational-wave data produced by the eponymous detectors. The catalog provides information about the identified candidates, such as the arrival time and amplitude of the signal and properties of the signal's source as inferred from the observational data. GWTC is the data release of this dataset and version 4.0 extends the catalog to include observations made during the first part of the fourth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run up until 2024 January 31. This paper marks an introduction to a collection of articles related to this version of the catalog, GWTC-4.0. The collection of articles accompanying the catalog provides documentation of the methods used to analyze the data, summaries of the catalog of events, observational measurements drawn from the population, and detailed discussions of selected candidates",

      "abstract": "The global network of gravitational-wave observatories now includes five detectors, namely LIGO Hanford, LIGO Livingston, Virgo, KAGRA, and GEO 600. These detectors collected data during their third observing run, O3, composed of three phases: O3a starting in April of 2019 and lasting six months, O3b starting in November of 2019 and lasting five months, and O3GK starting in April of 2020 and lasting 2 weeks. In this paper we describe these data and various other science products that can be freely accessed through the Gravitational Wave Open Science Center at https://gwosc.org. The main dataset, consisting of the gravitational-wave strain time series that contains the astrophysical signals, is released together with supporting data useful for their analysis and documentation, tutorials, as well as analysis software packages.",

      "abstract": "We present results from a search for X-ray/gamma-ray counterparts of gravitational-wave (GW) candidates from the third observing run (O3) of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) network using the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (Swift-BAT). The search includes 636 GW candidates received in low latency, 86 of which have been confirmed by the offline analysis and included in the third cumulative Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalogs (GWTC-3). Targeted searches were carried out on the entire GW sample using the maximum--likelihood NITRATES pipeline on the BAT data made available via the GUANO infrastructure. We do not detect any significant electromagnetic emission that is temporally and spatially coincident with any of the GW candidates. We report flux upper limits in the 15-350 keV band as a function of sky position for all the catalog candidates. For GW candidates where the Swift-BAT false alarm rate is less than 10$^{-3}$ Hz, we compute the GW--BAT joint false alarm rate. Finally, the derived Swift-BAT upper limits are used to infer constraints on the putative electromagnetic emission associated with binary black hole mergers.",

      "abstract": "A gravitational-wave (GW) transient was identified in data recorded by the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) detectors on 2015 September 14. The event, initially designated G184098 and later given the name GW150914, is described in detail elsewhere. By prior arrangement, preliminary estimates of the time, significance, and sky location of the event were shared with 63 teams of observers covering radio, optical, near-infrared, X-ray, and gamma-ray wavelengths with ground- and space-based facilities. In this Letter we describe the low-latency analysis of the GW data and present the sky localization of the first observed compact binary merger. We summarize the follow-up observations reported by 25 teams via private Gamma-ray Coordinates Network circulars, giving an overview of the participating facilities, the GW sky localization coverage, the timeline and depth of the observations. As this event turned out to be a binary black hole merger, there is little expectation of a detectable electromagnetic (EM) signature. Nevertheless, this first broadband campaign to search for a counterpart of an Advanced LIGO source represents a milestone and highlights the broad capabilities of the transient astronomy community and the observing strategies that have been developed to pursue neutron star binary merger events. Detailed investigations of the EM data and results of the EM follow-up campaign are being disseminated in papers by the individual teams.",

      "abstract": "Despite the growing number of confident binary black hole coalescences observed through gravitational waves so far, the astrophysical origin of these binaries remains uncertain. Orbital eccentricity is one of the clearest tracers of binary formation channels. Identifying binary eccentricity, however, remains challenging due to the limited availability of gravitational waveforms that include effects of eccentricity. Here, we present observational results for a waveform-independent search sensitive to eccentric black hole coalescences, covering the third observing run (O3) of the LIGO and Virgo detectors. We identified no new high-significance candidates beyond those that were already identified with searches focusing on quasi-circular binaries. We determine the sensitivity of our search to high-mass (total mass $M>70$ $M_\\odot$) binaries covering eccentricities up to 0.3 at 15 Hz orbital frequency, and use this to compare model predictions to search results. Assuming all detections are indeed quasi-circular, for our fiducial population model, we place an upper limit for the merger rate density of high-mass binaries with eccentricities $0 < e \\leq 0.3$ at $0.33$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ at 90\\% confidence level.",

      "abstract": "We detail the population properties of merging compact objects using 158 mergers from the cumulative Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog 4.0, which includes three types of binary mergers: binary neutron star, neutron star--black hole binary, and binary black hole mergers. We resolve multiple over- and under-densities in the black hole mass distribution: features persist at primary masses of $10\\,M_\\odot$ and $35\\,M_\\odot$ with a possible third feature at $\\sim 20\\,M_\\odot$. These are departures from an otherwise power-law-like continuum that steepens above $35\\,M_\\odot$. Binary black holes with primary masses near $10\\,M_\\odot$ are more likely to have less massive secondaries, with a mass ratio distribution peaking at $q = 0.74^{+0.13}_{-0.13}$, potentially a signature of stable mass transfer during binary evolution. Black hole spins are inferred to be non-extremal, with 90\\% of black holes having $χ< 0.57$, and preferentially aligned with binary orbits, implying many merging binaries form in isolation. However, we find a significant fraction, 0.24-0.42, of binaries have negative effective inspiral spins, suggesting many could be formed dynamically in gas-free environments. We find evidence for correlation between effective inspiral spin and mass ratio, though it is unclear if this is driven by variation in the mode of the distribution or the width. (Abridged)",

      "abstract": "We present a targeted search for continuous gravitational waves (GWs) from 236 pulsars using data from the third observing run of LIGO and Virgo (O3) combined with data from the second observing run (O2). Searches were for emission from the $l=m=2$ mass quadrupole mode with a frequency at only twice the pulsar rotation frequency (single harmonic) and the $l=2, m=1,2$ modes with a frequency of both once and twice the rotation frequency (dual harmonic). No evidence of GWs was found so we present 95\\% credible upper limits on the strain amplitudes $h_0$ for the single harmonic search along with limits on the pulsars' mass quadrupole moments $Q_{22}$ and ellipticities $\\varepsilon$. Of the pulsars studied, 23 have strain amplitudes that are lower than the limits calculated from their electromagnetically measured spin-down rates. These pulsars include the millisecond pulsars J0437\\textminus4715 and J0711\\textminus6830 which have spin-down ratios of 0.87 and 0.57 respectively. For nine pulsars, their spin-down limits have been surpassed for the first time. For the Crab and Vela pulsars our limits are factors of $\\sim 100$ and $\\sim 20$ more constraining than their spin-down limits, respectively. For the dual harmonic searches, new limits are placed on the strain amplitudes $C_{21}$ and $C_{22}$. For 23 pulsars we also present limits on the emission amplitude assuming dipole radiation as predicted by Brans-Dicke theory.",

      "abstract": "The Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC) is a collection of candidate gravitational-wave transient signals identified and characterized by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. Producing the contents of the GWTC from detector data requires complex analysis methods. These comprise techniques to model the signal; identify the transients in the data; evaluate the quality of the data and mitigate possible instrumental issues; infer the parameters of each transient; compare the data with the waveform models for compact binary coalescences; and handle the large amount of results associated with all these different analyses. In this paper, we describe the methods employed to produce the catalog's fourth release, GWTC-4.0, focusing on the analysis of the first part of the fourth observing run of Advanced LIGO, Advanced Virgo and KAGRA.",

      "abstract": "We present an all-sky search for long-duration gravitational waves (GWs) from the first part of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA fourth observing run (O4), called O4a and comprising data taken between 24 May 2023 and 16 January 2024. The GW signals targeted by this search are the so-called \"long-duration\" (> 1 s) transients expected from a variety of astrophysical processes, including non-axisymmetric deformations in magnetars or eccentric binary coalescences. We make minimal assumptions on the emitted GW waveforms in terms of morphologies and durations. Overall, our search targets signals with durations ~1-1000 s and frequency content in the range 16-2048 Hz. In the absence of significant detections, we report the sensitivity limits of our search in terms of root-sum-square signal amplitude (hrss) of reference waveforms. These limits improve upon the results from the third LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run (O3) by about 30% on average. Moreover, this analysis demonstrates substantial progress in our ability to search for long-duration GW signals owing to enhancements in pipeline detection efficiencies. As detector sensitivities continue to advance and observational runs grow longer, unmodeled long-duration searches will increasingly be able to explore a range of compelling astrophysical scenarios involving neutron stars and black holes.",

      "abstract": "We present results from the search for an isotropic gravitational-wave background using Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo data from O1 through O4a, the first part of the fourth observing run. This background is the accumulated signal from unresolved sources throughout cosmic history and encodes information about the merger history of compact binaries throughout the Universe, as well as exotic physics and potentially primordial processes from the early cosmos. Our cross-correlation analysis reveals no statistically significant background signal, enabling us to constrain several theoretical scenarios. For compact binary coalescences which approximately follow a 2/3 power-law spectrum, we constrain the fractional energy density to $Ω_{\\rm GW}(25{\\rm Hz})\\leq 2.0\\times 10^{-9}$ (95% cred.), a factor of 1.7 improvement over previous results. Scale-invariant backgrounds are constrained to $Ω_{\\rm GW}(25{\\rm Hz})\\leq 2.8\\times 10^{-9}$, representing a 2.1x sensitivity gain. We also place new limits on gravity theories predicting non-standard polarization modes and confirm that terrestrial magnetic noise sources remain below detection threshold. Combining these spectral limits with population models for GWTC-4, the latest gravitational-wave event catalog, we find our constraints remain above predicted merger backgrounds but are approaching detectability. The joint analysis combining the background limits shown here with the GWTC-4 catalog enables improved inference of the binary black hole merger rate evolution across cosmic time. Employing GWTC-4 inference results and standard modeling choices, we estimate that the total background arising from compact binary coalescences is $Ω_{\\rm CBC}(25{\\rm Hz})={0.9^{+1.1}_{-0.5}\\times 10^{-9}}$ at 90% confidence, where the largest contribution is due to binary black holes only, $Ω_{\\rm BBH}(25{\\rm Hz})=0.8^{+1.1}_{-0.5}\\times 10^{-9}$.",

      "abstract": "We report the observation of gravitational waves from two binary black hole coalescences during the fourth observing run of the LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA detector network, GW241011 and GW241110. The sources of these two signals are characterized by rapid and precisely measured primary spins, non-negligible spin--orbit misalignment, and unequal mass ratios between their constituent black holes. These properties are characteristic of binaries in which the more massive object was itself formed from a previous binary black hole merger, and suggest that the sources of GW241011 and GW241110 may have formed in dense stellar environments in which repeated mergers can take place. As the third loudest gravitational-wave event published to date, with a median network signal-to-noise ratio of $36.0$, GW241011 furthermore yields stringent constraints on the Kerr nature of black holes, the multipolar structure of gravitational-wave generation, and the existence of ultralight bosons within the mass range $10^{-13}$--$10^{-12}$ eV.",

      "abstract": "On 2023 November 23 the two LIGO observatories both detected GW231123, a gravitational-wave signal consistent with the merger of two black holes with masses $137^{+23}_{-18}\\, M_\\odot$ and $101^{+22}_{-50}\\, M_\\odot$ (90\\% credible intervals), at luminosity distance 0.7-4.1 Gpc and redshift of $0.40^{+0.27}_{-0.25}$, and a network signal-to-noise ratio of $\\sim$20.7. Both black holes exhibit high spins, $0.9^{+0.10}_{-0.19}$ and $0.80^{+0.20}_{-0.52}$ respectively. A massive black hole remnant is supported by an independent ringdown analysis. Some properties of GW231123 are subject to large systematic uncertainties, as indicated by differences in inferred parameters between signal models. The primary black hole lies within or above the theorized mass gap where black holes between 60-130 $M_\\odot$ should be rare due to pair instability mechanisms, while the secondary spans the gap. The observation of GW231123 therefore suggests the formation of black holes from channels beyond standard stellar collapse, and that intermediate-mass black holes of mass $\\sim$200 $M_\\odot$ form through gravitational-wave driven mergers.",

      "abstract": "We present Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (Fermi-GBM) and Swift Burst Alert Telescope (Swift-BAT) searches for gamma-ray/X-ray counterparts to gravitational wave (GW) candidate events identified during the third observing run of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. Using Fermi-GBM on-board triggers and sub-threshold gamma-ray burst (GRB) candidates found in the Fermi-GBM ground analyses, the Targeted Search and the Untargeted Search, we investigate whether there are any coincident GRBs associated with the GWs. We also search the Swift-BAT rate data around the GW times to determine whether a GRB counterpart is present. No counterparts are found. Using both the Fermi-GBM Targeted Search and the Swift-BAT search, we calculate flux upper limits and present joint upper limits on the gamma-ray luminosity of each GW. Given these limits, we constrain theoretical models for the emission of gamma-rays from binary black hole mergers.",

      "abstract": "We analyze data from 142 of the 218 gravitational-wave (GW) sources in the fourth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration (LVK) Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-4.0) to estimate the Hubble constant $H_0$ jointly with the population properties of merging compact binaries. We measure the luminosity distance and redshifted masses of GW sources directly; in contrast, we infer GW source redshifts statistically through i) location of features in the compact object mass spectrum and merger rate evolution, and ii) identifying potential host galaxies in the GW localization volume. Probing the relationship between source luminosity distances and redshifts obtained in this way yields constraints on cosmological parameters. We also constrain parameterized deviations from general relativity which affect GW propagation, specifically those modifying the dependence of a GW signal on the source luminosity distance. Assuming our fiducial model for the source-frame mass distribution and using GW candidates detected up to the end of the fourth observing run (O4a), together with the GLADE+ all-sky galaxy catalog, we estimate $H_0 = 76.6^{+13.0}_{-9.5} (76.6^{+25.2}_{-14.0})$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. This value is reported as a median with 68.3% (90%) symmetric credible interval, and includes combination with the $H_0$ measurement from GW170817 and its electromagnetic counterpart. Using a parametrization of modified GW propagation in terms of the magnitude parameter $Ξ_0$, we estimate $Ξ_0 = 1.2^{+0.8}_{-0.4} (1.2^{+2.4}_{-0.5})$, where $Ξ_0 = 1$ recovers the behavior of general relativity.",
