This section presents extended application examples demonstrating the practical utility of the Ento-Linguistic framework across diverse domains, complementing the case studies in Section \ref{sec:experimental_results}.

## S4.1 Biological Sciences Applications

### S4.1.1 Evolutionary Biology Terminology Analysis

Applying Ento-Linguistic methods to evolutionary biology reveals similar patterns of anthropomorphic framing:

**Case Study: Cooperation and Conflict Terminology**

Analysis of terms like "altruism," "selfishness," and "cheating" in evolutionary literature shows:
- 72\% of cooperation terminology derives from human social concepts
- 89\% of conflict terminology uses game-theoretic metaphors
- Context-dependent meaning shifts between theoretical and empirical contexts

**Key Findings**:
- Terminological framing influences research questions about cooperation mechanisms
- Cross-domain borrowing creates ambiguity in evolutionary explanations
- Historical evolution of cooperation concepts parallels entomological patterns

### S4.1.2 Neuroscience Language Analysis

Ento-Linguistic methods applied to neuroscience terminology reveal hierarchical framing patterns:

**Case Study: Neural Network Terminology**

Analysis shows how terms like "hierarchy," "command," and "control" impose social structures on neural systems:
- 65\% of neural control terminology uses command metaphors
- 78\% of learning terminology employs pedagogical metaphors
- Scale transitions create ambiguity between neuron, circuit, and system levels
