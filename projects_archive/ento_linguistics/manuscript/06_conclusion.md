# Conclusion {#sec:conclusion}

This work establishes Ento-Linguistic analysis as a methodology for examining how scientific language constitutes—rather than merely represents—knowledge about ant biology. Through computational analysis of terminology networks across six domains (Unit of Individuality, Behavior and Identity, Power \& Labor, Sex \& Reproduction, Kin \& Relatedness, and Economics), we demonstrate that entomological terminology carries systematic patterns of ambiguity, anthropomorphic framing, and conceptual structure that actively shape research practice. The accompanying open-source computational pipeline—implementing automated term extraction, co-occurrence network construction, and ambiguity scoring—provides a reproducible toolkit for extending this analysis to new corpora and domains.

## Core Contributions

The work makes three primary contributions. First, the six-domain analytical framework provides a comprehensive, reproducible architecture for examining how language shapes scientific understanding in entomology and, by extension, in other fields where human social concepts are projected onto non-human systems. Second, the computational pipeline demonstrates that large-scale, quantitative analysis of scientific discourse is both feasible and revealing—exposing structural patterns that qualitative analysis alone cannot detect. Third, the CACE meta-standards, defined in Section \ref{sec:methodology}, offer a practical evaluation framework:

- **Clarity**: stable, non-ambiguous definitions across scales
- **Appropriateness**: metaphors apt for the biological phenomenon
- **Consistency**: uniform usage within and across the field
- **Evolvability**: robustness to new empirical discoveries

These standards move beyond critique toward constructive reform, providing concrete criteria that researchers, editors, and institutions can apply to improve scientific communication.

## Future Directions

Several avenues emerge for extending this work.

**Multilingual and Cross-Cultural Analysis.** Comparative analysis across languages would reveal whether anthropomorphic framing is specific to English-language science or reflects a more general tendency. Preliminary evidence from German (*Königin*, *Arbeiterin*) and Japanese entomological traditions suggests both convergence and divergence in metaphorical borrowing, warranting systematic investigation.

**Longitudinal Terminology Tracking.** Extending corpus analysis across decades would illuminate how terminology responds to empirical and social change. Do genomic discoveries erode the dominance of "caste" vocabulary? Does institutional reform (e.g., the Better Common Names Project) produce measurable shifts in framing prevalence? Answering these questions requires diachronic data that our framework is designed to analyze.

**Educational and Editorial Tools.** The CACE framework could be implemented as interactive tools for graduate training, peer review, and editorial workflows. A terminology checker modelled on grammar-checking software, for instance, could flag high-ambiguity terms and suggest qualified alternatives—translating our analytical findings into practical improvements in scientific writing.

**Cross-Disciplinary Extension.** The Ento-Linguistic framework is not specific to entomology. Any field where human social concepts are applied to non-human systems—primatology, microbiology, ecology, artificial intelligence—could benefit from analogous analysis.

## Closing Remarks

The entanglement of speech and thought in scientific practice is neither accidental nor inconsequential. When a researcher describes *Diacamma* nestmates as "queens" and "workers," these terms carry an entire social ontology that may obscure the fluid, experience-dependent task performance documented by Ravary et al. \cite{ravary2007}. Replacing "queen" with "primary reproductive" is not merely cosmetic—it is a step toward aligning scientific language with biological reality. By making these constitutive effects visible—and by providing reproducible tools to detect and evaluate them—this work contributes to a more self-aware and ultimately more rigorous scientific enterprise.
