## Summary of Contributions

This work establishes Ento-Linguistic analysis as a methodology for examining how scientific language constitutes—rather than merely represents—knowledge about ant biology. Through computational analysis of terminology networks across six domains (Unit of Individuality, Behavior and Identity, Power \& Labor, Sex \& Reproduction, Kin \& Relatedness, and Economics), we demonstrate that entomological terminology carries systematic patterns of ambiguity, anthropomorphic framing, and conceptual structure that actively shape research practice.

## Key Findings

Three core findings emerge from this analysis:

**First**, terminology networks in entomology form coherent conceptual communities with strong domain clustering (clustering coefficient 0.67), hierarchical bridging terms, and context-dependent meanings affecting approximately three-quarters of analyzed terminology. These are not merely lexical patterns—they represent conceptual structures that constrain research questions and interpretive possibilities.

**Second**, the six Ento-Linguistic domains exhibit distinct terminological architectures. The Power \& Labor domain shows the highest ambiguity (0.81) and strongest anthropomorphic framing, where terms derived from human social hierarchies impose assumptions about ant colony organization \cite{herbers2007, crespi1992caste}. The Behavior and Identity domain reveals how transient actions are linguistically transformed into categorical identities, potentially obscuring the behavioral plasticity documented in contemporary research \cite{ravary2007, gordon2010}.

**Third**, the entanglement of speech and thought in scientific practice creates invisible constraints on inquiry \cite{whorf1956, foucault1972archaeology}. Researchers working within established terminological frameworks may not recognize how those frameworks shape what questions they ask, what methods they consider natural, and what interpretations they favor.

## Toward Meta-Standards for Scientific Communication

Building on the analytical findings and discussion, we propose four meta-standards for scientific terminology stewardship:

1. **Clarity**: Terminology should maximize understanding while minimizing unnecessary ambiguity. Terms that conflate distinct biological phenomena (e.g., "individuality" across nestmate and colony scales) should be disambiguated.

2. **Appropriateness**: Language should be appropriate to the biological phenomena being described. Terms importing human social structures—particularly hierarchical, racial, or gendered frameworks—should be critically evaluated and replaced where they distort understanding \cite{herbers2006, laciny2022neurodiversity, betternamesproject2024}.

3. **Consistency**: Within research communities, identical terms should carry identical meanings. The high context variability documented across domains (2.6 to 4.5 contexts per term) represents a concrete target for community-level standardization efforts.

4. **Evolvability**: Communication standards should include mechanisms for controlled terminological evolution as scientific understanding develops, avoiding both premature ossification and chaotic proliferation of alternatives.

## Future Directions

Several extensions of this work would significantly advance understanding of scientific discourse:

**Multilingual analysis** represents the most immediate priority. Comparing how, for example, the German term *Staaten* ("states") versus the English "colony" shapes research on social insect organization could reveal how linguistic structure itself—not just individual terms—influences scientific understanding across language communities.

**Longitudinal tracking** of terminological evolution would connect language change to theoretical change. The historical arc from Wheeler's \cite{wheeler1911} "superorganism" through mid-century skepticism to contemporary superorganism theory \cite{wilson2008superorganism} presents a natural case study for how terminology and theory co-evolve.

**Interactive terminology tools**, built on the computational infrastructure developed here, could provide researchers with real-time feedback on term appropriateness and suggest clearer alternatives drawn from the analytical database.

**Comparative disciplinary analysis** applying Ento-Linguistic methods across fields—neuroscience, ecology, microbiology—would test whether the patterns documented here reflect general properties of scientific language or domain-specific features of entomological discourse.

## Final Reflection

The entanglement of speech and thought in scientific practice creates both challenges and opportunities. The challenge lies in recognizing how established terminology creates invisible constraints on inquiry. The opportunity lies in developing the analytical tools and community standards to exercise conscious terminological stewardship—ensuring that scientific language serves the phenomena it describes, rather than the historical conditions of its origin.
