## Speech and Thought Entanglement in Scientific Communication

Speech and thought are inextricably entangled, a relationship recognized by linguists since at least Sapir and Whorf \cite{sapir1921, whorf1956}. This entanglement becomes particularly consequential in scientific discourse, where language not only describes phenomena but actively shapes how researchers perceive, categorize, and investigate them \cite{kuhn1996, foucault1972archaeology}. In entomology, researchers routinely employ anthropomorphic terminology—"queen," "worker," "slave," "caste"—that carries implicit assumptions about individuality, agency, and social structure. Our work examines this entanglement through systematic analysis of what we term *Ento-Linguistic domains*: specific areas where language use in ant research creates ambiguity, assumptions, or inappropriate framing.

## Motivation: Clear Communication as Ethical Imperative

Given the value-aligned nature of scientific communication, where researchers communicate with present and future colleagues on their "best behavior," there is compelling motivation to examine how language shapes scientific understanding. As Keller \cite{keller1995language} has argued, the language of science is not merely descriptive but constitutive—it actively structures research questions, methodological approaches, and interpretive frameworks. Lakoff and Johnson \cite{lakoff1980metaphors} demonstrated more broadly that metaphorical structures pervade human thought and reasoning; in science, these metaphors can become invisible yet powerful shapers of inquiry.

The consequential imperative is that the present moment represents an optimal opportunity to examine and improve scientific language use. Rather than perpetuating potentially problematic terminology, researchers bear an ethical responsibility to critically examine how language influences scientific practice and knowledge production. Recent initiatives such as the Entomological Society of America's Better Common Names Project \cite{betternamesproject2024} and scholarly critiques of anthropomorphic terminology in social insect research \cite{herbers2007, laciny2022neurodiversity} demonstrate growing recognition of this imperative.

## The Challenge of Terminological Reform

A common objection to improving scientific language is that changing terminology creates disconnection from existing literature, making it difficult to locate relevant research. If entomologists abandon terms like "caste" or "slave," how would researchers identify papers on task performance or social parasitism in ants?

This objection, however, inadvertently strengthens the case for reform. If we continue using potentially problematic terminology merely for convenience, we perpetuate and compound existing conceptual distortions rather than addressing them \cite{herbers2006}. The appropriate response is not to maintain the status quo but to actively work toward clearer communication while developing the necessary infrastructure for literature synthesis.

The solution lies in embracing this challenge systematically: restructuring information from existing literature (including original data and documents where possible) and establishing new meta-standards for scientific communication. This task represents an opportunity to set standards for how scientific communities care about their literature, their research communities, and the systems they study.

## Ento-Linguistic Domains: A Framework for Analysis

Our analysis centers on six key Ento-Linguistic domains where language use can be particularly ambiguous, assumptive, or inappropriate:

### Unit of Individuality

What constitutes an "ant"—the nestmate, the colony, or something else? This domain encompasses debates about biological individuality, from individual nestmates to super-organismal colony concepts \cite{wheeler1911, wilson2008superorganism}, examining how terminology influences research at different scales of analysis.

### Behavior and Identity

How do behavioral descriptions create identity assumptions? When an ant is observed carrying a seed, is it meaningfully described as "foraging," and does this make it "a forager"? This domain examines how behavioral language creates categorical identities that may not reflect the biological fluidity documented by recent research \cite{ravary2007}.

### Power \& Labor

What social structures do terms like "caste," "queen," "worker," and "slave" impose on ant societies? This domain investigates how terminology derived from human hierarchical systems shapes scientific understanding of ant social organization \cite{crespi1992caste, boomsma2018superorganismality}.

### Sex \& Reproduction

How do sex/gender concepts from human societies influence entomological research? Terms like "sex determination" and "sex differentiation" carry implicit assumptions about binary systems that may not map cleanly to ant reproductive biology, where haplodiploidy creates fundamentally different patterns \cite{chandra2021epigenetics}.

### Kin and Relatedness

What constitutes "kin" in ant societies, and how are different forms of relatedness (genetic, epigenetic, chemical, spatial) conceptualized? This domain examines how human kinship terminology, grounded in bilateral relatedness, influences understanding of ant social relationships structured by haplodiploidy and colony-level recognition cues.

### Economics

How do economic concepts structure understanding of resource allocation and trade in ant societies? This domain investigates how human economic terminology—markets, trade, investment—shapes analysis of ant foraging, resource distribution, and colony-level resource management.

## Research Approach

This work employs a mixed-methodology framework combining computational text analysis with theoretical discourse examination. We systematically map terminology networks, identify context-dependent language use, and develop recommendations for clearer scientific communication. The computational component processes entomological literature to identify statistical patterns in language use, while the theoretical component, informed by Foucault's archaeological method of discourse analysis \cite{foucault1972archaeology}, examines how these patterns reflect deeper conceptual structures.

## Example Analysis: Terminology Network Visualization

Computational analysis reveals structural patterns in scientific terminology that influence research discourse. Our network analysis demonstrates how terms cluster around conceptual domains and create networks of meaning that shape scientific understanding, as further detailed in Section \ref{sec:experimental_results}.

The six domains (Unit of Individuality, Behavior and Identity, Power \& Labor, Sex \& Reproduction, Kin \& Relatedness, and Economics) form interconnected clusters with cross-domain influences. Central hub terms like ``colony,''``caste,'' and ``individual'' connect multiple domains, demonstrating how specific terminological choices propagate across the scientific discourse of entomology.}

## Data and Analysis Framework

Our analysis framework integrates multiple data sources and methodological approaches:

- **Literature Corpus**: Scientific publications on ant biology and behavior
- **Terminology Database**: Curated collection of Ento-Linguistic terms with usage contexts
- **Computational Analysis**: Text mining, network analysis, and pattern detection
- **Theoretical Examination**: Discourse analysis informed by Foucault \cite{foucault1972archaeology} and conceptual metaphor theory \cite{lakoff1980metaphors}
- **Visualization**: Network visualizations and domain-specific analyses

All data and analysis code are reproducible and available for validation and extension.

## Implications for Scientific Practice

This work has broader implications for how scientists communicate across disciplines. By examining language use in entomology—a field with rich descriptive traditions and complex social systems—we develop principles applicable to scientific communication generally. The goal is not merely to critique existing practice but to establish foundations for clearer, more precise scientific discourse that better serves research communities and the phenomena they study.
