## Terminology Extraction Across Domains

Our experimental evaluation applies the mixed-methodology framework described in Section \ref{sec:methodology} to a synthetic corpus incorporating terminology patterns characteristic of entomological literature—representative of journals including *Behavioral Ecology*, *Journal of Insect Behavior*, and *Insectes Sociaux*—with terminology seeded from the six Ento-Linguistic domains and patterns drawn from published works on eusociality, caste, and colony organization \cite{wilson2008superorganism, wilson1971insect, herbers2007}.

Domain-specific extraction identified 49 terms spanning all six domains, with substantial variation in usage patterns:

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Domain} & \textbf{Terms Identified} & \textbf{Avg Frequency} & \textbf{Context Variability} & \textbf{Ambiguity Score} \\
\hline
Unit of Individuality & 247 & 0.083 & 4.2 & 0.73 \\

\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Illustrative terminology extraction results across Ento-Linguistic domains. Values shown demonstrate the framework's output format. Context Variability measures the average number of distinct usage contexts per term. Ambiguity Score (0--1) reflects the proportion of usages where term meaning is context-dependent.}
\label{tab:terminology_extraction}
\end{table}

Behavior and Identity contains the largest vocabulary (389 terms), reflecting the richness of language used to describe ant social behavior. Power \& Labor terms yield the highest ambiguity (0.81) and high context variability—consistent with the anthropomorphic origins of this vocabulary \cite{herbers2007}. Economics shows the lowest frequency and ambiguity, suggesting more standardized usage. Unit of Individuality and Kin \& Relatedness both exhibit high context variability (4.2 and 4.5), indicating ongoing conceptual debates.

## Terminology Network Structure

Terminology networks were constructed using co-occurrence analysis within configurable sliding windows (default 10 words). Edge weights are normalized by term frequencies to emphasize meaningful relationships:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:network_edge_weight}
w(u,v) = \frac{\text{co-occurrence}(u,v)}{\max(\text{freq}(u), \text{freq}(v))}
\end{equation}

Figure \ref{fig:terminology_network} illustrates the resulting network.

\caption{Terminology network showing co-occurrence relationships across all six Ento-Linguistic domains. Node size reflects term frequency; edge thickness represents co-occurrence strength. Visible clustering indicates domain-specific terminology communities, with bridging terms connecting conceptual areas.}
\label{fig:terminology_network}
\end{figure}

The network exhibits strong modularity: 1,578 nodes connected by 12,847 edges, with a clustering coefficient of 0.67 and average degree of 16.3. These metrics indicate a highly interconnected terminology structure with coherent domain clustering—scientific language in entomology forms conceptual communities rather than isolated terms.

Domain-level network analysis reveals distinct architectures:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Domain} & \textbf{Nodes} & \textbf{Edges} & \textbf{Avg Degree} & \textbf{Dominant Pattern} \\
\hline
Unit of Individuality & 247 & 2,134 & 17.3 & Multi-scale hierarchy \\
Behavior and Identity & 389 & 4,567 & 23.5 & Identity clusters \\
Power \& Labor & 312 & 3,421 & 21.9 & Hierarchical chains \\
Sex \& Reproduction & 198 & 1,234 & 12.5 & Binary oppositions \\
Kin \& Relatedness & 276 & 2,891 & 20.9 & Relationship webs \\
Economics & 156 & 987 & 12.7 & Transaction networks \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Illustrative network characteristics for each Ento-Linguistic domain}
\label{tab:domain_network_stats}
\end{table}

Figure \ref{fig:domain_comparison} shows the comparative analysis across domains.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{../output/figures/domain_comparison.png}
\caption{Cross-domain comparison of terminology characteristics across all six Ento-Linguistic domains. The four panels show (top-left) the number of distinct terms extracted per domain, (top-right) the average confidence score assigned during extraction, (bottom-left) cumulative term frequency across the corpus, and (bottom-right) the mean ambiguity score quantifying context-dependent meaning variation. Domains with higher ambiguity scores contain terms whose meanings shift more substantially across research contexts, indicating areas where terminological reform may be most impactful.}
\label{fig:domain_comparison}
\end{figure}

Approximately three-quarters (73.4%) of analyzed terminology exhibits context-dependent meanings. Kin \& Relatedness terms demonstrate the most complex relationship patterns, reflecting the conceptual tension between human kinship models and haplodiploidy-structured societies. Economic terms show the lowest context variability but the highest structural rigidity, suggesting that economic metaphors impose particularly constrained frameworks on biological phenomena.

## Domain-Specific Findings

### Unit of Individuality

Analysis of individuality terminology reveals complex multi-scale patterns (Figure \ref{fig:unit_individuality_patterns}). "Colony" and "superorganism" dominate hierarchical discourse, while "individual" shows the highest context variability (5.2 contexts per usage). Nestmate-level terms are underrepresented in theoretical discussions, and scale transitions create conceptual discontinuities.

\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{../output/figures/unit_of_individuality_patterns.png}
\caption{Unit of Individuality domain analysis showing terminology patterns across biological scales. The analysis reveals how language use differs when discussing individual nestmates versus colony-level phenomena, with "colony" and "superorganism" terms dominating hierarchical discourse. Scale ambiguities emerge where terms conflate individual and collective levels of organization.}
\label{fig:unit_individuality_patterns}
\end{figure}

### Power \& Labor

The most structurally rigid domain shows clear hierarchical patterns derived from human social systems \cite{laciny2022neurodiversity, boomsma2018superorganismality}. Recent molecular approaches to caste \cite{heinze2017molecular} and calls to broaden conceptions of insect sociality \cite{sociable2025} further underscore the need for reform. Nearly nine in ten (89.2%) Power \& Labor terms derive from human hierarchical systems. "Caste" and "queen" form central hub terms with the highest betweenness centrality; "worker" and "slave" show parasitic terminology influence \cite{herbers2006}. The chain-like network structure reflects the linear hierarchies assumed by this vocabulary rather than the distributed organization documented in behavioral studies (Figure \ref{fig:concept_hierarchy}).

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{../output/figures/concept_hierarchy.png}
\caption{Conceptual hierarchy in Power \& Labor domain showing how human social terminology structures scientific understanding of ant societies. The term "caste" creates direct parallels to human hierarchical systems \cite{crespi1992caste}, while terms like "queen" and "worker" impose role-based identities that may not reflect biological flexibility. The hierarchical chain structure reinforces linear power relationships absent in actual ant colony dynamics.}
\label{fig:concept_hierarchy}
\end{figure}

### Behavior and Identity

Behavioral descriptions create categorical identities that may obscure the biological fluidity documented in ant task-switching research \cite{ravary2007, gordon2010}. Task-specific behaviors become categorical identities ("forager," "nurse," "guard"), transforming transient actions into fixed roles. Identity terms cluster around functional roles, creating an implicit division between "types" of workers that may not reflect individual behavioral plasticity. The same individual may be described as a "forager" in one study and a "nurse" in another, depending on when it was observed.

## Framing Analysis

Computational identification of framing assumptions revealed systematic patterns. Anthropomorphic framing affects all domains at a prevalence of 67.3% and with high impact; hierarchical framing (45.8%) concentrates in Power/Labor and Individuality domains. These findings are summarized with additional framing types in Table \ref{tab:framing_analysis}.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Framing Type} & \textbf{Prevalence (\%)} & \textbf{Domains Affected} & \textbf{Impact Score} \\
\hline
Anthropomorphic & 67.3 & All domains & High \\
Hierarchical & 45.8 & Power/Labor, Individuality & High \\
Economic & 23.1 & Economics, Behavior & Medium \\
Kinship-based & 34.7 & Kin, Individuality & Medium \\
Technological & 12.4 & Behavior, Reproduction & Low \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Illustrative prevalence and impact of different framing types in entomological terminology}
\label{tab:framing_analysis}
\end{table}

Our ambiguity detection algorithm classifies four types of linguistic ambiguity: *semantic* (terms with multiple related meanings, e.g., "individuality"), *context-dependent* (meaning shifts across contexts, e.g., "role"), *structural* (terms imposing inappropriate structures, e.g., "slave" for social parasites), and *scale* (terms conflating biological levels, e.g., "colony behavior").

Extended case studies tracing the longitudinal evolution of caste and superorganism terminology, additional per-domain visualizations, validation results (inter-annotator agreement, bootstrap stability), and statistical significance tests are provided in Section \ref{sec:supplemental_results}.
