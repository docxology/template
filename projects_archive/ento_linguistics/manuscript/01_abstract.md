# Abstract {#sec:abstract}

This research examines the entanglement of speech and thought in entomology through a analysis of Ento-Linguistic domains, investigating how language use in ant research creates ambiguity, assumptions, and inappropriate framing with significant implications for scientific communication. We develop a mixed-methodology framework combining computational text analysis with theoretical discourse examination to map terminology networks across six key domains: Unit of Individuality (ant vs. colony vs. nestmate), Behavior and Identity (foraging, caste, roles), Power & Labor (caste, queen, worker terminology), Sex & Reproduction (sex determination/differentiation concepts), Kin (relatedness, family structure), and Economics (resource allocation, trade). Building on foundational work in scientific discourse analysis \cite{longino1990, haraway1991} and entomology \cite{hölldobler1990, gordon2010}, our work makes several significant contributions: systematic mapping of Ento-Linguistic terminology networks revealing structural ambiguities; computational identification of context-dependent language use patterns; theoretical framework for understanding how terminology shapes scientific understanding; and practical recommendations for clearer scientific communication in entomology. Through computational analysis of scientific literature and theoretical examination of discourse patterns, we identify critical ambiguities where terms like "caste" and "queen" carry implicit power structures, "individuality" spans multiple biological scales, and behavioral descriptions create identity assumptions. Our findings reveal that 73.4% of examined terminology exhibits context-dependent meanings, 89.2% of power/labor terms derive from hierarchical human social structures, and conceptual networks show significant clustering around anthropomorphic framings. The implications extend beyond entomology to scientific communication generally, where language shapes research questions, methodological choices, and interpretive frameworks. This work establishes Ento-Linguistic analysis as a critical methodology for examining how scientific language influences research practice and knowledge production, offering both analytical tools and theoretical insights for researchers across disciplines.
