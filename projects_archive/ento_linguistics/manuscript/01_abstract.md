# Abstract {#sec:abstract}

Scientific language does not merely describe biological phenomena; it constitutes the **generative model** through which researchers parse complex systems. In entomology, anthropomorphic terminology—"queen," "worker," "caste"—imposes implicit top-down control structures on what are fundamentally **stigmergic**, self-organizing systems. This linguistic framing distorts the causal modeling of insect behavior, obscuring the mechanisms of distributed agency.

We present a mixed-methodology framework integrating computational text analysis with **Active Inference** and **Complex Systems Theory** to investigate how language use in ant research creates ambiguity and inappropriate framing. Our pipeline extracts domain-specific terminology, constructs co-occurrence networks, and computes ambiguity scores across six Ento-Linguistic domains. Analysis of a comprehensive corpus of **3,253 publications** (comprising 473,322 tokens) extracts **9,315 candidate terms**, of which **1,841 unique terms** receive domain classification, with **1,578 primary assignments** across six Ento-Linguistic domains, revealing terminology networks with strong domain clustering and cross-domain bridging.

Computational results show that the Power \& Labor domain consistently yields the highest ambiguity scores: hub terms such as "caste" and "queen" impose hierarchical control layers absent from the biology they purport to describe. Across domains, conceptual networks reveal that "individuality" spans multiple biological scales, blurring the formal boundaries (**Markov Blankets**) required for rigorous systems modeling. Behavioural descriptions routinely transform fluid, policy-dependent processes into categorical identities.

These findings extend beyond entomology to scientific communication generally, where language shapes research questions, methodological choices, and interpretive frameworks. We propose four evidence-based meta-standards—**Clarity**, **Appropriateness**, **Consistency**, and **Evolvability** (CACE)—as a protocol for **lexical engineering**. The accompanying open-source computational pipeline provides reproducible analytical tools for rigorous terminological stewardship.
