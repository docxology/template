# Abstract {#sec:abstract}

Scientific language does not merely describe biological phenomena—it actively shapes how researchers perceive, categorize, and investigate them. This entanglement of speech and thought is particularly consequential in entomology, where anthropomorphic terminology carries implicit assumptions about individuality, agency, and social structure that may not map onto insect biology.

We develop a mixed-methodology framework combining computational text analysis with theoretical discourse examination to investigate how language use in ant research creates ambiguity, assumptions, and inappropriate framing. Our analysis maps terminology networks across six Ento-Linguistic domains: Unit of Individuality, Behavior and Identity, Power \& Labor, Sex \& Reproduction, Kin \& Relatedness, and Economics. Building on foundational work in scientific discourse analysis \cite{longino1990, haraway1991, foucault1972archaeology} and entomology \cite{hölldobler1990, gordon2010}, this framework integrates quantitative pattern detection with qualitative conceptual analysis.

Computational analysis of entomological literature reveals that the majority of examined terminology exhibits context-dependent meanings, with the Power \& Labor domain showing the highest ambiguity scores. Nearly nine in ten power and labor terms derive from hierarchical human social structures, and conceptual networks show significant clustering around anthropomorphic framings. Terms such as "caste" and "queen" carry implicit power structures, "individuality" spans multiple biological scales without consistent usage, and behavioral descriptions routinely transform fluid biological processes into categorical identities.

The implications extend beyond entomology to scientific communication generally, where language shapes research questions, methodological choices, and interpretive frameworks. This work establishes Ento-Linguistic analysis as a methodology for examining how scientific language constitutes—rather than merely represents—research practice and knowledge production, offering both analytical tools and practical recommendations for clearer scientific discourse.
