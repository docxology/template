# Abstract {#sec:abstract}

Scientific language actively shapes how researchers perceive, categorize, and investigate biological phenomena. In entomology, anthropomorphic terminology—"queen," "worker," "caste"—carries implicit assumptions about individuality, agency, and social structure that may not map onto insect biology.

We present a mixed-methodology framework that combines computational text analysis with theoretical discourse examination to investigate how language use in ant research creates ambiguity, assumptions, and inappropriate framing. Our pipeline extracts domain-specific terminology, constructs co-occurrence networks, and computes ambiguity scores across six Ento-Linguistic domains—Unit of Individuality, Behavior and Identity, Power \& Labor, Sex \& Reproduction, Kin \& Relatedness, and Economics. Analysis of a curated corpus identifies 49 terms spanning all six domains, with terminology networks exhibiting strong domain clustering and cross-domain bridging. Building on scientific discourse analysis \cite{longino1990, haraway1991, foucault1972archaeology} and entomological theory \cite{hölldobler1990, gordon2010}, this approach integrates quantitative pattern detection with qualitative conceptual analysis.

Computational results show that the Power \& Labor domain consistently yields the highest ambiguity scores: a substantial proportion of its terms derive from hierarchical human social structures, and hub terms such as "caste" and "queen" carry implicit power framings absent from the biology they purport to describe. Across domains, conceptual networks reveal that "individuality" spans multiple biological scales without consistent usage, and behavioural descriptions routinely transform fluid biological processes into categorical identities.

These findings extend beyond entomology to scientific communication generally, where language shapes research questions, methodological choices, and interpretive frameworks. We propose four evidence-based meta-standards—**Clarity**, **Appropriateness**, **Consistency**, and **Evolvability** (CACE)—for terminological stewardship. The accompanying open-source computational pipeline provides reproducible analytical tools alongside practical recommendations for clearer scientific discourse.
