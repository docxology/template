"""Active Inference Meta-Pragmatic Framework.

This package implements theoretical concepts for understanding Active Inference
as a meta-(pragmatic/epistemic) method, including the 2x2 matrix framework
of Data/Meta-Data × Cognitive/Meta-Cognitive processing.

Modules:
- active_inference: Core Active Inference concepts and EFE calculations
- free_energy_principle: Free Energy Principle formulations and system boundaries
- quadrant_framework: 2x2 matrix implementation and quadrant definitions
- generative_models: Generative model structures (A, B, C, D matrices)
- meta_cognition: Meta-cognitive concepts and reflective processing
- modeler_perspective: Dual role of modeler as architect and subject
- data_generator: Synthetic data generation for demonstrations and testing
- statistical_analysis: Statistical testing, regression, and hypothesis validation
- validation: Framework validation suite and correctness checking
- visualization: Publication-quality plotting and figure generation
