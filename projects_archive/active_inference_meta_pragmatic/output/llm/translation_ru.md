1. **English Abstract:**
The objective of this paper is to analyze and evaluate the effectiveness of a new AI system for enhancing cognitive performance in tasks that require self-reflection and metacognitive awareness. The research aims at evaluating the impact of specific training paradigms, such as the use of supervised learning techniques, on the ability of the system to improve its performance across different domains (e.g., emotional intelligence, decision-making) while minimizing negative consequences for cognitive well-being.
