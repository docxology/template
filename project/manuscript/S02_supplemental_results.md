This section provides additional experimental results that complement Section \ref{sec:experimental_results}.

## S2.1 Detailed Room Analysis

### S2.1.1 Room-by-Room Distribution

Detailed analysis of ways across each of the 24 rooms reveals specific patterns:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Room} & \textbf{Way Count} & \textbf{Primary Dialogue Type} & \textbf{Avg. Centrality} \\
\hline
Room 1 (Believing 1) & TBD & TBD & TBD \\
Room 2 (Believing 2) & TBD & TBD & TBD \\
Room 3 (Believing 3) & TBD & TBD & TBD \\
Room 4 (Believing 4) & TBD & TBD & TBD \\
\ldots & \ldots & \ldots & \ldots \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Detailed room-by-room analysis}
\label{tab:room_detailed}
\end{table}

### S2.1.2 Room Relationships

Analysis of room co-occurrence (ways assigned to multiple rooms) reveals:

- **Most common room pairs**: TBD
- **Room clusters**: Groups of rooms that frequently co-occur
- **Room hierarchy**: Relationships between rooms in the House structure

## S2.2 Dialogue Partner Analysis

### S2.2.1 Partner Frequency

Analysis of dialogue partners (`dialoguewith`) reveals:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Dialogue Partner} & \textbf{Frequency} & \textbf{Percentage} \\
\hline
Partner 1 & TBD & TBD\% \\
Partner 2 & TBD & TBD\% \\
Partner 3 & TBD & TBD\% \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Most frequent dialogue partners}
\label{tab:partner_frequency}
\end{table}

### S2.2.2 Partner-Type Relationships

Cross-analysis of dialogue partners and dialogue types reveals whether certain partners are associated with certain types of dialogue.

## S2.3 Network Community Analysis

### S2.3.1 Detected Communities

Community detection algorithms identify TBD major communities:

- **Community 1**: TBD ways, primarily [theme]
- **Community 2**: TBD ways, primarily [theme]
- **Community 3**: TBD ways, primarily [theme]

### S2.3.2 Community Characteristics

Each community exhibits:
- Dominant dialogue types
- Room distributions
- Central ways within the community
- Connections to other communities

## S2.4 God Relationship Analysis

### S2.4.1 Dievas Field Distribution

Analysis of the `Dievas` (God relationship) field reveals:

- Distribution of ways across different God relationships
- Relationship between God relationships and dialogue types
- Patterns in how ways engage with the divine/transcendent

### S2.4.2 Type-God Relationships

Cross-tabulation of dialogue types and God relationships shows whether certain types are more associated with certain God relationships.

## S2.5 Example Analysis

### S2.5.1 Example Patterns

Analysis of examples reveals:
- Common example structures
- Recurring themes in examples
- How examples illustrate ways

### S2.5.2 Example-Way Relationships

Mapping examples to ways shows:
- Which ways have the most examples
- Diversity of examples per way
- Patterns in example types

## S2.6 Question-Way Relationships

### S2.6.1 Question Distribution

Analysis of the `klausimobudai` table reveals:
- Number of questions per way
- Most frequently referenced ways
- Question clusters

### S2.6.2 Question Themes

Text analysis of questions (`klausimai` table) identifies:
- Common question themes
- Question-word relationships
- How questions relate to ways

## S2.7 Extended Network Metrics

### S2.7.1 Path Analysis

Analysis of shortest paths between ways reveals:
- Average path length: TBD
- Diameter: TBD
- Path distribution

### S2.7.2 Clustering Analysis

Local clustering coefficients show:
- Ways with high local clustering (tight communities)
- Ways that bridge communities (low local clustering, high betweenness)
- Overall clustering structure

## S2.8 Temporal Patterns (if available)

If dating information is available in the data:
- Evolution of ways over time
- Patterns in when ways were documented
- Relationships between documentation order and way characteristics

## S2.9 Validation Results

### S2.9.1 Data Quality Metrics

- Completeness: TBD\% of ways have all required fields
- Consistency: TBD conflicts resolved
- Referential integrity: TBD\% of relationships valid

### S2.9.2 Analysis Robustness

Sensitivity analysis shows:
- Results robust to missing data
- Stable under different network construction methods
- Consistent across different analysis approaches
