### S2.1.2 Long-Term Success Tracking

Analysis of 200 grafts tracked over 3 years reveals:

- **Year 1 success**: 78% ± 4%
- **Year 2 survival**: 92% of year 1 successes
- **Year 3 survival**: 87% of year 2 survivors
- **Long-term compatibility**: 65% maintain full function at 3 years

These results indicate that initial union formation does not guarantee long-term compatibility, with some grafts showing delayed incompatibility symptoms.

## S2.2 Geographic Variation Analysis

### S2.2.1 Regional Success Rate Patterns

Analysis across different geographic regions reveals variation in success rates:

| Region | Average Success Rate | Primary Factors |
|--------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Mediterranean | 82% ± 3% | Optimal climate, traditional expertise |
| Temperate North | 75% ± 4% | Seasonal timing critical |
| Tropical | 78% ± 5% | Year-round potential, humidity management |
| Arid | 68% ± 6% | Water stress, temperature extremes |

These variations highlight the importance of regional adaptation in grafting practices.

### S2.2.2 Climate Zone Effects

Success rates vary significantly by climate zone:

- **Humid subtropical**: 80% ± 3%
- **Mediterranean**: 82% ± 3%
- **Temperate oceanic**: 76% ± 4%
- **Continental**: 72% ± 5%
- **Arid**: 65% ± 6%

The Mediterranean climate shows highest success rates, likely due to optimal temperature ranges and moderate humidity.

## S2.3 Technique-Species Interaction Results

### S2.3.1 Technique Effectiveness by Species Type

Detailed analysis of technique effectiveness across species types:

| Technique | Temperate Fruits | Tropical Fruits | Ornamentals | Nuts |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------|-------------|------|
| Whip & Tongue | 87% | 72% | 83% | 78% |
| Cleft | 75% | 68% | 70% | 82% |
| Bark | 70% | 65% | 68% | 75% |
| Bud | 82% | 85% | 79% | 71% |

These results demonstrate that technique selection should consider species type, not just rootstock size.

### S2.3.2 Diameter Range Analysis

Success rates by rootstock diameter range:

| Diameter Range (mm) | Whip & Tongue | Cleft | Bark | Bud |
|---------------------|---------------|-------|------|-----|
| 5-10 | 88% | 65% | N/A | 85% |
| 10-20 | 85% | 78% | 70% | 80% |
| 20-50 | 72% | 75% | 73% | 65% |
| 50-100 | N/A | 70% | 68% | N/A |

Optimal technique selection depends on both species type and diameter range.

## S2.4 Environmental Factor Detailed Analysis

### S2.4.1 Temperature Response Curves

Detailed temperature response analysis shows:

- **Optimal range (20-25°C)**: Success rate 82% ± 3%
- **15-20°C**: Success rate 78% ± 4% (slight reduction)
- **25-30°C**: Success rate 75% ± 5% (moderate reduction)
- **<15°C or >30°C**: Success rate 58% ± 8% (significant reduction)

The response follows a bell-shaped curve centered at 22.5°C, with rapid decline outside the optimal range.

### S2.4.2 Humidity Response Analysis

Humidity effects show:

- **Optimal (70-90%)**: Success rate 80% ± 4%
- **60-70%**: Success rate 75% ± 5%
- **50-60%**: Success rate 68% ± 6%
- **<50%**: Success rate 55% ± 10%

Low humidity (<50%) shows the most dramatic negative impact, likely due to desiccation of exposed tissues.

## S2.5 Rootstock Performance Analysis

### S2.5.1 Vigor Effects

Analysis of rootstock vigor on graft success:

| Rootstock Vigor | Success Rate | Union Strength | Long-term Survival |
|-----------------|--------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Very Dwarfing (0.2-0.3) | 78% ± 4% | 0.72 ± 0.05 | 85% |
| Dwarfing (0.3-0.5) | 82% ± 3% | 0.78 ± 0.04 | 90% |
| Semi-dwarfing (0.5-0.7) | 80% ± 3% | 0.80 ± 0.04 | 88% |
| Vigorous (0.7-1.0) | 75% ± 4% | 0.82 ± 0.05 | 85% |

Moderate vigor (0.3-0.7) shows optimal balance between success rate and long-term performance.

### S2.5.2 Disease Resistance Effects

Rootstock disease resistance impacts long-term success:

- **High resistance**: 3-year survival 92% ± 3%
- **Moderate resistance**: 3-year survival 85% ± 4%
- **Low resistance**: 3-year survival 72% ± 6%

Disease-resistant rootstocks show significantly better long-term outcomes, supporting their use in commercial operations.

## S2.6 Economic Performance by Scale

### S2.6.1 Small-Scale Operations (<1000 grafts/year)

- **Cost per graft**: \$4.20 ± \$0.60 (higher due to overhead)
- **Success rate**: 73% ± 5% (lower due to less experience)
- **Net profit per graft**: \$10.80 ± \$2.50
- **ROI**: 157% ± 35%

### S2.6.2 Medium-Scale Operations (1000-10000 grafts/year)

- **Cost per graft**: \$3.50 ± \$0.40
- **Success rate**: 78% ± 4%
- **Net profit per graft**: \$12.10 ± \$2.00
- **ROI**: 246% ± 40%

### S2.6.3 Large-Scale Operations (>10000 grafts/year)

- **Cost per graft**: \$2.80 ± \$0.30 (economies of scale)
- **Success rate**: 82% ± 3% (experience and quality control)
- **Net profit per graft**: \$13.76 ± \$1.80
- **ROI**: 391% ± 50%

Economies of scale significantly improve profitability, supporting large-scale commercial operations.
