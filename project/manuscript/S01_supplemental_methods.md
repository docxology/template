# Supplemental Methods {#sec:supplemental_methods}

This section provides detailed methodological information that supplements Section \ref{sec:methodology}.

## S1.1 Extended Grafting Techniques

### S1.1.1 Approach Grafting

Approach grafting (also called inarching) involves joining two growing plants while both remain on their own roots, then severing the scion from its roots after union formation. This technique is particularly useful for difficult-to-graft species or when precise alignment is challenging.

**Procedure**:
1. Select healthy rootstock and scion plants in close proximity
2. Make matching cuts on both plants (30-40° angle)
3. Align cambium layers and secure together
4. Allow union to form over 4-8 weeks
5. Gradually reduce scion root system
6. Sever scion from its roots after full union establishment

**Success Rate**: 70-80% for compatible species, 50-60% for difficult combinations

### S1.1.2 Bridge Grafting

Bridge grafting is used to repair damaged bark by bridging wounds with scion pieces. This technique is essential for tree rescue operations and bark damage repair.

**Procedure**:
1. Prepare damaged area by cleaning and removing dead tissue
2. Make cuts above and below the damaged region
3. Prepare scion pieces (typically 2-4 pieces depending on wound size)
4. Insert scion pieces to bridge the gap, aligning cambium
5. Secure and seal all connections
6. Monitor and protect until union forms

**Success Rate**: 60-70% depending on wound severity and timing

### S1.1.3 Inarching

Inarching involves grafting rootstock seedlings to established trees to add roots, improving root system health and stability.

**Procedure**:
1. Prepare rootstock seedlings (typically 1-2 years old)
2. Make matching cuts on tree and rootstock
3. Join and secure with cambium alignment
4. Allow union to form (6-12 weeks)
5. Rootstock provides additional root system support

**Success Rate**: 65-75% for compatible species

## S1.2 Detailed Technique Protocols

### S1.2.1 Whip and Tongue Grafting - Step by Step

**Materials Required**:
- Sharp grafting knife
- Grafting tape or wax
- Rootstock and scion of matching diameter
- Protective covering

**Detailed Steps**:

1. **Rootstock Preparation**:
   - Select healthy rootstock with diameter 5-25 mm
   - Make 30-45° angle cut, 2-3 cm long
   - Create tongue (notch) 1/3 from top of cut, 1 cm deep

2. **Scion Preparation**:
   - Select dormant scion with 2-4 buds
   - Make matching angle cut and tongue
   - Ensure cambium is visible on both sides

3. **Joining**:
   - Insert scion tongue into rootstock notch
   - Align cambium layers precisely on both sides
   - Ensure tight fit with no gaps

4. **Securing**:
   - Wrap with grafting tape, starting below union
   - Overlap tape by 50% for complete coverage
   - Seal exposed surfaces with grafting wax

5. **Post-Grafting Care**:
   - Protect from direct sunlight
   - Maintain humidity 70-90%
   - Monitor for 4-6 weeks
   - Remove tape after union forms

### S1.2.2 Cleft Grafting - Detailed Protocol

**Optimal Conditions**:
- Rootstock diameter: 10-50 mm
- Timing: Late winter to early spring
- Temperature: 15-25°C
- Humidity: 70-85%

**Procedure Details**:

1. **Rootstock Preparation**:
   - Cut rootstock horizontally at desired height
   - Make vertical split 3-5 cm deep using grafting tool
   - Keep split open with wedge if needed

2. **Scion Preparation**:
   - Select scion with 2-3 buds
   - Make wedge-shaped cut (30-40° angle on both sides)
   - Ensure cambium exposed on both sides of wedge

3. **Insertion**:
   - Insert scion into cleft, aligning cambium on one side
   - For large rootstock, insert 2 scions (one on each side)
   - Remove wedge and allow rootstock to close

4. **Sealing**:
   - Apply grafting wax to all exposed surfaces
   - Cover entire union area
   - Protect from weather
