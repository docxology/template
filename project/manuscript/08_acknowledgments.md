# Acknowledgments {#sec:acknowledgments}

We gratefully acknowledge the contributions that made this research possible.

## Primary Source

This research is based entirely on the philosophical work of **Andrius Kulikauskas**, who developed the "Ways of Figuring Things Out" framework and documented 284 ways of knowledge acquisition. The framework, database, and documentation are the result of his extensive philosophical work conducted in 2010-2011.

## Data Availability

All data used in this research is in the **Public Domain** as stated in the source documentation. The MySQL database dump and text documentation (`ways.md`) are publicly available and were used with appropriate attribution.

## Framework Development

The House of Knowledge framework, the 24-room structure, and the dialogue type classifications are all part of Andrius Kulikauskas's original philosophical work. This research provides systematic documentation and analysis but does not claim to have developed the underlying framework.

## Technical Infrastructure

This research builds upon:

- **Python scientific computing stack** (NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, NetworkX, Matplotlib)
- **SQLite** database system for data storage and querying
- **LaTeX and Pandoc** for document preparation
- **Open-source tools** for data analysis and visualization

## Research Context

This work contributes to the systematic documentation and analysis of philosophical frameworks, demonstrating how quantitative methods can complement qualitative understanding. The integration of database analysis, network analysis, and statistical methods with philosophical interpretation represents a methodological contribution to the study of knowledge systems.

## Future Contributions

Future researchers building on this work should acknowledge:
- Andrius Kulikauskas as the originator of the Ways framework
- The public domain status of the source data
- The systematic analysis and documentation provided by this research
