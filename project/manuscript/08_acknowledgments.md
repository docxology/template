# Acknowledgments

This work stands on the foundations laid by G. Spencer-Brown, whose *Laws of Form* (1969) opened a new path in mathematical logic. We acknowledge the profound influence of his insight that distinction precedes all else.

We are grateful to Louis H. Kauffman for his extensive work connecting the calculus of indications to knot theory, self-reference, and category theory, and for keeping the Laws of Form tradition alive in contemporary mathematics.

William Bricken's development of boundary mathematics for computation demonstrated the practical viability of iconic notation and inspired the computational framework presented here.

The philosophical grounding draws extensively from the North American pragmatist tradition—Charles Sanders Peirce, William James, John Dewey—whose emphasis on consequences and operations aligns with the calculus's operational character. We also acknowledge the neo-materialist contributions of Karen Barad, Donna Haraway, and Jane Bennett, whose work on agential cuts and relational ontology illuminates the metaphysical significance of distinction.

The infrastructure for this research project was developed using the Research Project Template, providing reproducible build processes, automated testing, and integrated literature management.

Computational verification was performed using Python with NumPy and Matplotlib for visualization. All source code is available in the accompanying repository under the Apache 2.0 license.
