# Acknowledgments {#sec:acknowledgments}

This comprehensive review and computational framework synthesizes 4,000+ years of accumulated grafting knowledge, drawing from diverse sources across agricultural science, plant biology, and horticultural practice.

## Historical Knowledge

We acknowledge the countless generations of agricultural practitioners, from ancient Mesopotamian and Chinese grafters to contemporary horticultural researchers, whose empirical observations and innovations form the foundation of this work.

## Scientific Literature

This research builds upon foundational works in grafting biology \cite{melnyk2018, goldschmidt2014}, horticultural practice \cite{garner2013, hartmann2014}, and rootstock development \cite{webster2002}, among many others cited throughout this manuscript.

## Computational Infrastructure

The computational toolkit was developed using open-source scientific computing resources:

- Python scientific computing stack (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib) for numerical analysis and visualization
- LaTeX, Pandoc, and XeLaTeX for professional document preparation
- Research Project Template framework for reproducible research workflows

## Traditional Knowledge Systems

We recognize the importance of traditional grafting knowledge systems across cultures—Mediterranean, Asian, Indigenous, and others—whose practices have been refined through millennia of observation and adaptation. This work attempts to honor these traditions by integrating them with modern scientific understanding.

## Educational Mission

This project is dedicated to making grafting knowledge accessible to students, practitioners, researchers, and enthusiasts across the agricultural sciences. The integration of comprehensive documentation with practical computational tools aims to support both learning and application.
