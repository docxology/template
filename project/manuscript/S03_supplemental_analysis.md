# Supplemental Analysis {#sec:supplemental_analysis}

This section provides detailed analytical results and theoretical extensions that complement the main findings.

## S3.1 Theoretical Framework Extensions

### S3.1.1 Epistemological Foundations

The Ways framework extends traditional epistemology by:

1. **Pluralism**: Recognizing multiple valid ways of knowing
2. **Structure**: Providing organization through the House of Knowledge
3. **Dialogue**: Emphasizing relational aspects of knowledge
4. **Integration**: Combining belief, care, and learning

### S3.1.2 Learning Theory Integration

The framework integrates with learning theory through:

- **Believing structures**: Connect to constructivist learning
- **Caring structures**: Relate to experiential learning
- **Relative learning**: Maps to iterative/reflective learning cycles

### S3.2.1 Advanced Centrality Metrics

Beyond basic centrality, we analyze:

- **Eigenvector Centrality**: Importance based on connections to important nodes
- **PageRank**: Adapted for way importance
- **Katz Centrality**: Weighted importance with attenuation

Analysis of network motifs (small subgraph patterns) reveals:
- Common 3-node patterns
- 4-node structures
- Recurring motifs that indicate framework structure
