# Supplemental Analysis: Pragmatist and Neo-Materialist Foundations

## S3.1 North American Pragmatism and the Calculus of Indications

### The Peircean Heritage

Charles Sanders Peirce (1839-1914) developed **Existential Graphs**—a diagrammatic logic that anticipates Spencer-Brown's calculus in fundamental ways \cite{peirce1931,kauffman2001}. The connection is not merely superficial but structural.

#### Peirce's Existential Graphs

Peirce's system employs:
- **Sheet of Assertion**: The blank page represents truth (cf. Spencer-Brown's unmarked space)
- **Cuts**: Closed curves that negate their contents (cf. enclosure)
- **Juxtaposition**: Co-presence on the sheet represents conjunction

| Peirce's Graphs | Spencer-Brown | Interpretation |
|-----------------|---------------|----------------|
| Blank sheet | Void | Base state |
| Cut (○) | Mark $\langle\ \rangle$ | Negation/distinction |
| Double cut | $\langle\langle\ \rangle\rangle$ | Double negation = identity |
| Adjacent graphs | Juxtaposition | Conjunction |

Peirce's **Alpha graphs** (propositional logic) are essentially isomorphic to the calculus of indications.

#### Phaneroscopy and Firstness

Peirce's categories illuminate the boundary:

1. **Firstness**: Quality of feeling, pure possibility—*the void before distinction*
2. **Secondness**: Reaction, resistance, brute fact—*the act of distinction*
3. **Thirdness**: Mediation, law, representation—*the form after distinction*

The mark $\langle\ \rangle$ instantiates the passage from Firstness (void) through Secondness (drawing) to Thirdness (form).

#### Semiotics and the Icon

Spencer-Brown's notation is fundamentally **iconic** in Peirce's sense:
- The mark *looks like* what it represents (a boundary)
- The notation exhibits its meaning rather than merely denoting it
- Reasoning proceeds by manipulation of the icon itself

> "The icon does not stand for its object by resembling it... it is itself a fragment of that object." — Peirce

### William James: Radical Empiricism

James's **radical empiricism** \cite{james1912} insisted that relations are as real as the things related. This aligns with boundary logic:

| James | Containment Theory |
|-------|-------------------|
| Relations are real | Boundaries are primitive |
| Conjunctive relations | Juxtaposition |
| Disjunctive relations | Separation by mark |
| Pure experience | Void before distinction |

James's "stream of consciousness" fragments through distinction; the calculus formalizes this fragmentation.

#### The Pragmatic Maxim

Peirce's pragmatic maxim: "Consider what effects... the object of our conception has. Then, our conception of these effects is the whole of our conception of the object."

For the mark $\langle\ \rangle$:
- **Effect**: Creates inside/outside
- **Conception**: The mark *is* distinction itself
- **Meaning**: Fully contained in operational consequences

### John Dewey: Inquiry as Distinction

Dewey's **instrumentalism** \cite{dewey1938} treats inquiry as the transformation of indeterminate situations into determinate ones—precisely the function of distinction.

| Dewey's Inquiry | Boundary Operation |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Indeterminate situation | Void |
| Problematic situation | Recognition of need for distinction |
| Institution of a problem | Drawing the mark |
| Determination | Canonical form |

Dewey's emphasis on **continuity** (situations flowing into one another) parallels the recursive structure of nested boundaries.

#### Experience and Nature

> "To exist is to be in a situation..." — Dewey

To be distinguished *is* to exist. The mark creates existence from the void. Dewey's naturalism grounds this in biological and cultural practice: organisms survive by making effective distinctions.

## S3.2 Process Philosophy and the Mark

### Alfred North Whitehead

Whitehead's **process philosophy** \cite{whitehead1929} provides metaphysical grounding:

#### Actual Entities

Whitehead's **actual entities** are the final real things:
- Each actual entity *becomes* through **prehension** (grasping others)
- The void corresponds to **eternal objects** (pure potentiality)
- The mark corresponds to **actualization** (becoming definite)

| Whitehead | Containment Theory |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Creativity | The capacity for distinction |
| Eternal objects | Void (potentiality) |
| Actual entities | Marked forms |
| Prehension | Enclosure (taking in) |
| Concrescence | Reduction to canonical form |

#### The Category of the Ultimate

Whitehead's three notions:
1. **Creativity**: The ultimate principle of novelty
2. **Many**: The disjunctive diversity of the universe
3. **One**: The novel entity synthesizing the many

Distinction (mark-making) *is* creativity instantiated: from the many (void, undifferentiated), the one (canonical form) emerges.

## S3.3 Neo-Materialism and Agential Realism

### Karen Barad: Intra-action

Karen Barad's **agential realism** \cite{barad2007} reconceives the relationship between observer, observed, and observation. The boundary is not between pre-existing entities but constitutive of entities.

#### Intra-action vs. Interaction

| Traditional View | Barad's Agential Realism | Containment Theory |
|------------------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| Entities interact | Entities intra-act | Forms compose |
| Boundaries pre-exist | Boundaries enacted | Mark creates boundary |
| Observer separate | Observer entangled | Self-reference (imaginary values) |

#### Agential Cuts

Barad's **agential cuts** determine what becomes determinate:

> "It is through specific agential intra-actions that the boundaries and properties of the 'components' of phenomena become determinate." — Barad, *Meeting the Universe Halfway*

The Spencer-Brown mark *is* an agential cut: it doesn't represent a pre-existing distinction but enacts one.

#### Diffraction

Barad's **diffraction** (vs. reflection) as methodological approach:
- Reflection presupposes fixed identities mirrored
- Diffraction attends to patterns of difference

Reduction in boundary logic is diffractive: it doesn't preserve original form but produces interference patterns (canonical forms) from distinctions.

### Donna Haraway: Situated Knowledges

Haraway's **situated knowledges** \cite{haraway2016} reject the "god trick" of seeing everything from nowhere:

| God Trick | Situated Knowledge | Boundary Logic |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| View from nowhere | View from somewhere | View from inside/outside |
| Unmarked observer | Marked observer | Observer as form |
| Neutral | Positioned | Self-referential |

The imaginary value $j = \langle j \rangle$ formalizes the observer observing itself—a situated, recursive position.

## S3.4 Deleuze and Immanence

### Difference in Itself

Gilles Deleuze's **philosophy of difference** \cite{deleuze1968} resonates with distinction-as-primitive:

| Representational Thought | Deleuze | Containment Theory |
|--------------------------|---------|-------------------|
| Identity primary | Difference primary | Distinction primary |
| Difference = not-same | Difference in itself | Mark creates difference |
| Categories fixed | Categories produced | Forms reducible |

#### The Virtual and the Actual

Deleuze's **virtual/actual** distinction maps onto void/mark:

| Deleuze | Spencer-Brown | Character |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| Virtual | Void | Real but not actual |
| Actualization | Mark-making | Determination |
| Actual | Canonical form | Fully determined |

The void is *virtual*—it has real effects (as identity for conjunction) without being actual (marked).

### Intensive Differences

Deleuze's **intensive quantities** (differences that don't divide without changing nature) relate to depth in boundary logic:

- Depth = intensive magnitude
- Flattening (reduction) changes nature
- $\langle\langle a \rangle\rangle \neq \langle a \rangle \neq a$ intensively

## S3.5 Brian Massumi and Affect

### Affect and the Virtual

Massumi's **affect theory** \cite{massumi2002} treats intensity as prior to formed content:

| Massumi | Containment Theory |
|---------|-------------------|
| Affect (intensity) | Void (potential) |
| Emotion (qualified) | Form (structured) |
| Passage | Reduction |
| Autonomy of affect | Resistance to reduction |

Irreducible forms (already canonical) resist further passage—they are "stuck" affects.

### Ontopower

Massumi's **ontopower**: power operating at the level of emergence.

The capacity to make distinctions *is* ontopower—the capacity to create realities by differentiating the undifferentiated.

## S3.6 New Materialism and Matter's Agency

### Vibrant Matter (Jane Bennett)

Jane Bennett's **vital materialism** \cite{bennett2010} attributes agency to matter itself:

| Bennett | Boundary Logic |
|---------|----------------|
| Actants | Forms as actors |
| Assemblages | Juxtapositions |
| Thing-power | Reduction capacity |

Forms are not passive representations but active participants in reduction—they *do* things.

### Material Semiotics (ANT)

Actor-Network Theory's **material semiotics**:
- Signs and things are equally actors
- Networks are heterogeneous assemblages
- Translation transforms identities

The calculus of indications is maximally material-semiotic: the notation (material marks) *is* the logic (semiotic structure).

## S3.7 Synthesis: Pragmatist-Materialist Containment

### Core Commitments

From these traditions, Containment Theory inherits:

1. **Anti-representationalism** (Pragmatism): Forms don't represent; they enact
2. **Relational ontology** (Neo-materialism): Boundaries constitute entities
3. **Process primacy** (Whitehead): Becoming precedes being
4. **Situatedness** (Haraway): Observer within system
5. **Difference primacy** (Deleuze): Distinction before identity

### The Mark as Pragmatic-Materialist Primitive

The mark $\langle\ \rangle$ unifies:
- **Pragmatist**: Operational definition (effects = meaning)
- **Materialist**: Physical inscription (matter makes marks)
- **Processual**: Temporal act (distinction happens)
- **Relational**: Creates relations (inside/outside)

### Research Program

This philosophical grounding suggests:

1. **Experimental Pragmatism**: Test forms by their consequences
2. **Material Practice**: Implement forms in physical media
3. **Processual Analysis**: Study reduction as temporal unfolding
4. **Ecological Thinking**: Forms in environments of other forms
