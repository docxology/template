- **Disease-resistant stock**: Creating resistant planting stock
- **Climate adaptation**: Combining adapted rootstocks with native scions
- **Success rates**: 65-75% in field conditions

The compatibility database supports selection of appropriate rootstock-scion combinations for restoration projects.

### S4.3.2 Urban Forestry

Urban tree management through grafting:

- **Tree rescue**: Bridge grafting for damaged trees
- **Vigor control**: Dwarfing rootstocks for confined spaces
- **Disease management**: Resistant rootstocks for urban stress
- **Success rates**: 70-80% with proper care

The economic analysis tools support cost-benefit evaluation of tree rescue operations.

## S4.4 Specialty Crops

### S4.4.1 Nut Tree Production

Nut tree grafting applications:

- **Walnut production**: English walnut on black walnut rootstock
- **Pecan cultivation**: Grafting for consistent nut quality
- **Almond orchards**: Rootstock selection for soil adaptation
- **Success rates**: 75-85% for compatible combinations

The rootstock analysis tools are particularly valuable for nut crops, where rootstock characteristics significantly impact production.

### S4.4.2 Tropical Fruit Production

Tropical fruit grafting:

- **Mango production**: Multiple varieties on single rootstock
- **Avocado cultivation**: Rootstock selection for disease resistance
- **Citrus diversity**: Multiple citrus types on compatible rootstocks
- **Success rates**: 78-88% in optimal conditions

The year-round grafting potential in tropical climates is supported by the seasonal planning algorithms.

## S4.5 Conservation Applications

### S4.5.1 Rare Species Propagation

Grafting for conservation:

- **Endangered species**: Multiplying limited genetic material
- **Ex situ conservation**: Maintaining genetic diversity in collections
- **Reintroduction programs**: Producing planting stock for restoration
- **Success rates**: 60-70% for difficult species

The compatibility prediction framework helps identify viable rootstock options for rare species with limited propagation history.

### S4.5.2 Heritage Variety Preservation

Preserving heritage fruit varieties:

- **Historical varieties**: Maintaining genetic resources
- **Cultural preservation**: Preserving traditional varieties
- **Genetic diversity**: Maintaining broad genetic base
- **Success rates**: 80-90% for well-documented combinations

The species database supports identification of compatible rootstocks for heritage varieties.

## S4.6 Research Applications

### S4.6.1 Rootstock Breeding Programs

The toolkit supports rootstock breeding:

- **Compatibility screening**: Predicting success before field trials
- **Trait combination**: Identifying promising rootstock-scion combinations
- **Efficiency improvement**: Reducing trial costs through prediction
- **Success rates**: Predictions within 10% of actual field results

The compatibility prediction algorithms accelerate rootstock development programs.

### S4.6.2 Physiological Studies

Grafting for research applications:

- **Hormonal studies**: Investigating graft-transmissible signals
- **Disease resistance**: Studying resistance mechanisms
- **Stress responses**: Analyzing graft union stress tolerance
- **Success rates**: 75-85% in controlled research conditions

The biological simulation models support experimental design and hypothesis testing.
