# Abstract

Containment Theory presents an alternative foundation to classical Set Theory, replacing the primitive notion of membership ($\in$) with spatial containment through boundary distinctions. Building on G. Spencer-Brown's *Laws of Form* (1969), we develop a complete computational framework for **boundary logic** (also called the **calculus of indications**) that demonstrates its equivalence to Boolean algebra while offering distinct advantages in parsimony, geometric intuition, and handling of self-reference. **Boundary logic** is a logical system built from the primitive act of drawing distinctions (boundaries), while the **calculus of indications** is Spencer-Brown's original name for this formal system.

The calculus operates from just two axioms: **Calling** ($\langle\langle a \rangle\rangle = a$, where double enclosure returns to the original form) and **Crossing** ($\langle\ \rangle\langle\ \rangle = \langle\ \rangle$, where multiple marks condense to a single mark). From these primitives, we derive the complete Boolean algebra, establishing that the marked state $\langle\ \rangle$ corresponds to TRUE and the unmarked void (empty space) corresponds to FALSE, with enclosure $\langle a \rangle$ representing negation and juxtaposition $ab$ representing conjunction.

We present a **reduction engine** that transforms arbitrary boundary **forms** (expressions built from marks, enclosures, and juxtapositions) to **canonical representations** (either void or mark—the simplest irreducible forms), prove termination in polynomial time for **ground forms** (forms without variables, where all values are concrete), and verify all derived theorems computationally. Our implementation achieves formal verification of Spencer-Brown's nine consequences (C1-C9), De Morgan's laws, and the fundamental Boolean axioms through systematic reduction to canonical forms.

The comparison with Set Theory reveals that boundary logic achieves logical completeness with minimal axiomatic commitment (2 vs 9+ axioms in ZFC), provides native geometric interpretation through nested boundaries, and naturally handles self-referential structures through Spencer-Brown's "imaginary" Boolean values—constructs that create paradoxes in classical set theory. These properties suggest applications in circuit design, cognitive modeling, and foundations of computation.

This work establishes Containment Theory as a viable alternative foundation for discrete mathematics, with complete computational verification of its theoretical claims and open-source implementation for further investigation.
