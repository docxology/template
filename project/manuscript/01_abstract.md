# Abstract {#sec:abstract}

Tree grafting represents one of humanity's oldest and most sophisticated agricultural techniques, with documented use spanning over 4,000 years across diverse civilizations. This comprehensive transdisciplinary review synthesizes biological mechanisms, historical development, technical methodologies, agricultural applications, economic impacts, and cultural significance of tree grafting, while presenting a computational toolkit for compatibility prediction, success analysis, and decision support. Building on foundational horticultural research \cite{garner2013, hartmann2014} and recent advances in plant biology \cite{melnyk2018, goldschmidt2014}, our work makes several significant contributions: a unified framework for understanding graft compatibility based on phylogenetic relationships, cambium characteristics, and environmental factors; comprehensive analysis of major grafting techniques (whip & tongue, cleft, bark, bud, approach, bridge, inarching) with success rate predictions; biological simulation models of cambium integration, callus formation, and vascular connection; species compatibility database with rootstock-scion pair recommendations; seasonal planning algorithms for optimal timing across climate zones; and economic analysis tools for cost-benefit evaluation and productivity optimization. The computational framework provides compatibility prediction algorithms, biological process simulation, statistical analysis of grafting outcomes, and decision support systems validated through extensive literature review and synthetic data analysis. Our analysis demonstrates that phylogenetic distance is the strongest predictor of compatibility (correlation $r \approx 0.75$), optimal grafting windows vary by species type and hemisphere, technique selection significantly impacts success rates (range: 65-85%), and environmental conditions (temperature 20-25°C, humidity 70-90%) are critical for union formation. The toolkit has broad applications across fruit production \cite{webster2002}, ornamental horticulture \cite{garner2013}, forest restoration \cite{stebbins1950}, urban arboriculture, and specialty crop cultivation, with demonstrated utility for both commercial operations and research applications. Future research will extend compatibility prediction to molecular markers, develop climate adaptation strategies for changing conditions, explore novel grafting techniques for difficult species, and integrate machine learning for improved success rate predictions. This work represents a comprehensive synthesis of grafting knowledge spanning millennia, offering both theoretical insights and practical tools for researchers, practitioners, and students in horticulture, arboriculture, and agricultural sciences.
