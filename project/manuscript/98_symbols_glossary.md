## Glossary

### Agential Cut
(Barad) An enacted boundary that constitutes the entities it separates; parallels the Spencer-Brown mark as constitutive rather than representational.

### Boundary
A line of demarcation creating inside and outside; the fundamental operation in the calculus of indications.

### Calling
Axiom J1: Double enclosure returns to the original form. Also known as involution or double negation elimination.

### Canonical Form
The irreducible form of an expression after all reduction rules have been applied. Only void and mark are canonical.

### Condensation
See Crossing.

### Containment Theory
The approach to mathematical foundations using spatial containment (boundaries) rather than set membership.

### Crossing
Axiom J2: Multiple marks in juxtaposition condense to a single mark. Also known as condensation.

### Distinction
The fundamental act of separating this from that; the primitive notion in the calculus of indications.

### Enclosure
The operation of placing a boundary around a form; corresponds to logical negation.

### Existential Graphs
C.S. Peirce's diagrammatic logic system, a precursor to Spencer-Brown's calculus.

### Form
Any well-formed expression in the calculus of indications, built from void, mark, enclosure, and juxtaposition.

### Icon
(Peirce) A sign that represents by resembling what it signifies; the mark is iconic of distinction.

### Imaginary Value
A self-referential form satisfying $j = \langle j \rangle$; neither marked nor void but oscillating between states.

### Indication
The act of pointing to or marking; the fundamental operation in Laws of Form.

### Intra-action
(Barad) Mutual constitution of entities through their interaction; parallels how forms co-determine through juxtaposition.

### Juxtaposition
Placing forms side by side; corresponds to logical conjunction (AND).

### Laws of Form
G. Spencer-Brown's 1969 book introducing the calculus of indications.

### Mark
The symbol $\langle\ \rangle$ representing the primary distinction; corresponds to TRUE.

### Pragmatism
North American philosophical tradition emphasizing consequences, practice, and operational meaning; grounds boundary logic's emphasis on reduction as meaning.

### Primary Distinction
The fundamental cognitive act of creating a boundary; the primitive of the calculus.

### Reduction
The process of applying axioms to simplify a form toward its canonical representation.

### Self-Reference
A form that contains itself as a subform; leads to imaginary values in boundary logic.

### Void
The empty space containing no marks; corresponds to FALSE. Also called the unmarked state.

### ZFC
Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory with Choice; the standard axiomatic foundation for mathematics, contrasted with Containment Theory.
