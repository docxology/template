## English Abstract

This manuscript presents a comprehensive overview of optimization algorithms for large-scale machine learning. The research objective is to develop and evaluate novel optimization methods that can efficiently solve complex problems in machine learning. To achieve this goal, the authors propose a suite of optimization algorithms based on stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and proximal methods.

The methodology involves combining SGD with various regularization techniques, such as L1 and L2 penalties, to promote sparsity and improve convergence rates. The authors also introduce a new proximal method that incorporates a quadratic penalty term to enhance the efficiency of the optimization process.

Key findings include the development of novel optimization algorithms that demonstrate improved performance on large-scale machine learning problems. The results show that the proposed methods can achieve faster convergence rates, reduced computational costs, and enhanced robustness compared to existing optimization techniques.

The significance of this research lies in its potential to revolutionize the field of machine learning by providing a new generation of optimization algorithms that can efficiently solve complex problems. The implications are far-reaching, with potential applications in areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, and recommender systems.
