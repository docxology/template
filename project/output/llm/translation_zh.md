### ## English Abstract

The manuscript presents a unified framework for analyzing and comparing various stochastic optimization algorithms that are popular in machine learning. The authors first introduce the concept of the "stochastic average gradient" (SAG) algorithm, which is a simple iterative method for minimizing the expected value of a finite sum of random variables. They then show how to use this idea to analyze many existing methods, including the stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, and proximal gradient descent (PGD). The main results are as follows:
1. **Stochastic average gradient** (SAG) is a simple iterative method for minimizing the expected value of a finite sum of random variables. It is defined by the recurrence $x_{k+1} = x_k - \alpha A_k$, where $A_k$ is a sequence of independent and identically distributed random vectors, and $\alpha > 0$. The SAG algorithm can be used to analyze many existing methods.
2. **Stochastic gradient descent** (SGD) is the most widely used stochastic optimization method in machine learning. It is defined by the recurrence $x_{k+1} = x_k - \alpha A$, where $A$ is a random vector, and $\alpha > 0$. The SAG algorithm can be analyzed using the SAG framework.
3. **Adam** is an adaptive stochastic optimization method that was introduced in the paper [2]. It is defined by the recurrence $x_{k+1} = x_k - \alpha A$, where $A$ is a random vector, and $\alpha > 0$. The Adam algorithm can be analyzed using the SAG framework.
