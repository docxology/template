### 1. Introduction

A comprehensive overview of the manuscript is presented in this section, including the research objective and motivation, methodology overview, key findings and results, significance and implications.

The authors present an algorithmic framework for accelerating the training of large-scale neural networks by exploiting the fact that the gradient descent (GD) updates are often dominated by a few small gradients. The proposed method is based on the observation that the GD updates are often dominated by a few small gradients. To this end, the authors propose a new adaptive learning rate algorithm, which is called AdamW. The key idea of AdamW is to use the gradient magnitude as an additional input for the update rule. The main advantage of AdamW is that it can speed up the training and improve the performance on some specific tasks. In addition, the authors also provide a comparison between AdamW and other optimization algorithms.
