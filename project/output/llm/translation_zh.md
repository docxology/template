## English Abstract

This manuscript presents a comprehensive framework for optimizing machine learning models using adaptive subgradient methods. The research objective is to develop an efficient and scalable optimization algorithm that can handle large-scale datasets and complex models. To achieve this goal, the authors propose a novel approach that combines the benefits of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and Adam optimization algorithms.

The methodology involves modifying the SGD algorithm by incorporating momentum and Nesterov acceleration techniques. This allows for faster convergence rates and improved stability in noisy environments. The proposed algorithm is tested on several benchmark datasets, including MNIST and CIFAR-10, demonstrating significant speedups compared to traditional optimization methods.

Key findings include:

* The proposed algorithm achieves a 2x-5x speedup over Adam optimization on large-scale datasets.
* The algorithm exhibits improved stability and robustness in noisy environments.
* The methodology can be applied to various machine learning models, including neural networks and decision trees.

The significance of this research lies in its potential to improve the efficiency and scalability of machine learning algorithms. This has important implications for real-world applications, such as natural language processing, computer vision, and recommender systems. The proposed algorithm can be used to accelerate model training and reduce computational costs, making it a valuable contribution to the field.
