## English Abstract

The House of Knowledge (HoK) is a unique framework that organizes and interconnects diverse ways of thinking about things in a comprehensive manner. This manuscript presents the first characterization of the 24 rooms of the HoK, which are organized into four categories: the three categories of the original framework (theoretical, practical, and aesthetic), and an additional category that is not part of the original framework but is also important for understanding the ways of thinking about things. The data were collected from a variety of sources, including philosophical texts, educational literature, psychological research, and social media. The analysis was based on the 24 rooms of the HoK, which are organized into four categories: theoretical (n=6), practical (n=8), aesthetic (n=5), and not part of the original framework (n=5). The results show that the ways of thinking about things in the theoretical category include a variety of philosophical perspectives. In the practical category, there is a range of different approaches to problem-solving. The aesthetic category includes a range of creative and artistic ways of thinking about things. The not part of the original framework category includes a range of different types of knowledge that are important for understanding the ways of thinking about things in the other three categories. The results also show that there is a significant diversity across all four categories in terms of the number of ways, the proportion of each way, and the distribution of the ways across the four categories. The analysis provides a comprehensive characterization of the 24 rooms of the HoK, which can be used to understand the nature of the framework and how it might be applied in different contexts.

本文首次对House of Knowledge（HoK）进行了全面的描述。该框架将不同方式的思考组织起来，并且在四个类别中相互连接。数据来自哲学文献、教育文学和社交媒体等多种来源。分析基于HoK的24个房间，这些房间被组织到四个类别：理论（n=6）、实践（n=8）、美学（n=5）和不是原有框架的一部分（n=5）。结果表明，理论类别中包括多种哲学观点。实践类别中有不同解决问题的方法。美学类别中包括多种艺术和创造性的思考方式。不是原有框架的一部分类别中包括了HoK中其他三类别所需的知识。结果也表明，在这四个类别中都存在很大的多样性：在所有类别中，方法的数量、每种方法占比和分布都不同。在分析中，我们对HoK的24个房间进行了全面的描述，这些描述可以用来理解框架的本质和如何将其应用于不同的背景下。
