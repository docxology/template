## English Abstract


This paper presents a novel foundation for the free energy principle (FEP) based on boundary logic (BL), which is an alternative to the traditional thermodynamic and information-theoretic foundations. The FEP has been successfully applied in various domains such as neuroscience, cognitive science, computer vision, engineering, and economics. It can be used to explain a wide range of phenomena from the simplest sensory perception to complex decision-making. However, the original FEP is based on the traditional thermodynamic and information-theoretic foundations which are not directly applicable to the study of cognition. The main purpose of this paper is to provide an alternative foundation for the FEP in terms of BL. In the first part of the manuscript, we present a new perspective on the FEP from the view of BL. This perspective can be used as a starting point to understand the FEP and its applications. The second part of the manuscript presents the main content of this paper. We show that the FEP is based on the boundary logic (BL) which is an alternative to the traditional thermodynamic and information-theoretic foundations. In the third part, we provide some examples for the FEP in terms of BL. The fourth part provides a conclusion.
