## English Abstract

This paper presents a general-purpose framework for analyzing and comparing the performance of various optimization algorithms on large-scale machine learning problems. The proposed framework is based on two main components: (1) a set of standardized benchmarking tools that can be used to compare different methods, and (2) a set of standardized datasets that are representative of real-world machine learning applications. In this paper, we describe the first version of the framework in detail, which includes the design of the benchmarking tools and the selection of the initial set of standardized datasets. The proposed framework is designed with the goal to facilitate the comparison of different optimization algorithms on large-scale machine learning problems. The performance of an algorithm can be compared by using the same set of benchmarking tools on the same set of standardized datasets, which allows for a fair comparison between different methods. This paper also provides the initial set of standardized datasets that are representative of real-world machine learning applications.

本文提出了一种通用框架，用于分析和比较机器学习问题的各种优化算法在大规模机器学习问题上的性能。该框架基于两个主要组件：（1）一组标准化的评估工具，可以对不同方法进行比较；（2）一组标准化的数据集，这些数据是机器学习应用中实际存在的代表性数据。可以使用同一组标准化的评估工具来比较不同的算法，而这些算法可以在同一组标准化的数据集中运行，这样就允许进行公平的比较。该文也提供了初步的标准化数据集，这些数据是机器学习应用中实际存在的代表性数据。该框架设计的目的是为了使不同方法之间能够公平地进行比较。在本文中，我们对该框架的第一个版本进行了详细的描述，其中包括评估工具的设计和选择标准化数据集的初步选择。该框架是为了使不同算法在大规模机器学习问题上能够公平地进行比较。在这个框架下，算法的性能可以通过使用同一组标准化的评估工具来比较，而这些算法可以在同一组标准化的数据集中运行，这样就允许进行公平的比较。该文也提供了初步的标准化数据集，这些数据是机器学习应用中实际存在的代表性数据。
