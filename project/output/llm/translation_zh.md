### ## English Abstract

The manuscript presents a novel framework for adaptive optimization of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants. The proposed method is based on the observation that SGD can be viewed as an instance of the first-order proximal-point algorithm with a special choice of the proximal mapping, which allows us to leverage the convergence theory of the first-order proximal point algorithm in the nonconvex setting. In this manuscript, we show that the proposed method is able to achieve the optimal rate for the nonconvex optimization problem.
