## English Abstract


This manuscript presents a comprehensive framework for optimizing machine learning models using stochastic optimization algorithms. The research objective is to develop an efficient and scalable approach for minimizing finite sums with the stochastic average gradient (SAG) algorithm. The methodology involves combining SAG with proximal algorithms, which enables the optimization of complex functions with multiple local minima.

The key findings demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing methods in terms of convergence speed and scalability. The results show that the framework can efficiently optimize large-scale machine learning models with millions of parameters. The significance of this research lies in its potential to improve the performance and efficiency of machine learning algorithms, which is crucial for real-world applications.

The implications of this research are far-reaching, as it has the potential to revolutionize the field of machine learning by enabling the optimization of complex functions with multiple local minima. This could lead to significant advances in areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, and recommender systems.
