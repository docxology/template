## Overall Quality Score
**Score: 4/5**
The overall quality of the manuscript is very good, but there are a few areas that could be improved. The main strength of this manuscript is its technical accuracy and organization. The authors provide an in-depth description of their algorithm and show it to work on several different datasets. This is a well-organized and coherent paper with clear descriptions of the method and the results. However, the writing could be better and there are some minor issues that detract from the overall quality.

## Clarity Assessment
**Score: 4/5**
The authors do an excellent job of explaining their algorithm in detail. The text is well-organized and easy to follow. There are a few places where the language is overly formal, but this does not detract from the clarity of the writing. The results section is very clear and provides all the information that one would want to know about how the method performed on different datasets.

## Structure and Organization
**Score: 4/5**
The structure of the paper is well-organized. The authors provide a good overview in the introduction, describe their algorithm in detail in the methods section, and show the results clearly in the results section. However, there are some minor issues with the organization that detract from the overall quality. For example, it would be helpful to have an abstract or summary at the beginning of the paper. The authors could also provide a more detailed description of the datasets used for evaluation.

## Technical Accuracy
**Score: 5/5**
The technical accuracy is excellent. There are no errors in the description of the algorithm and the results that I found. It would be helpful to have some more detail about the implementation, but this is not necessary for a manuscript of this type. The authors do an excellent job of providing all the information needed to understand their method.

## Readability
**Score: 3/5**
The readability of the paper could be better. There are some minor issues with the writing that detract from the overall quality. For example, there is no abstract or summary at the beginning of the paper. The authors do not provide a detailed description of the datasets used for evaluation. Some of the sentences in the results section are overly long and contain multiple clauses. It would be helpful to have some more detail about how the method was implemented.

## Specific Issues Found
The following specific issues were found:
* The manuscript does not have an abstract or summary at the beginning.
* The authors do not provide a detailed description of the datasets used for evaluation.
* Some of the sentences in the results section are overly long and contain multiple clauses.

## Recommendations
I would recommend that the authors add an abstract to the beginning of the paper. They could also provide more detail about how the method was implemented, but this is not necessary for a manuscript of this type. The writing could be better in some places, but it does not detract from the overall quality of the manuscript.
