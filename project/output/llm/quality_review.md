**Overall Quality Score: 4/5**

The manuscript is well-organized and presents an interesting and original perspective on the free energy principle, which could be a valuable contribution to the field of active inference. The authors' use of "boundary logic" as a foundation for their theory is a good idea, but it may not be clear enough at this point in the paper. 

**Clarity Assessment: 4/5**

The writing is generally clear and concise, although there are some places where the text could be clarified. For example, the authors' use of "boundary logic" as an alternative to traditional mathematical foundations for the free energy principle may not be entirely clear at this point in the paper. The manuscript would benefit from a more detailed explanation of how the boundary logic is used and what it means. 

**Structure and Organization: 4/5**

The structure of the manuscript is good, but there are some issues with the organization. The authors' use of "containment" as an organizing theme for the paper could be confusing to readers who do not know that this is a reference to the work by Maturana and Varela. The paper would benefit from more specific section headings, especially in the introduction. 

**Technical Accuracy: 5/5**

The technical accuracy of the manuscript is very good. There are no errors that I can see.

**Specific Issues Found:**
