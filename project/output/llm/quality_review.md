## Overall Quality Score
**Score: 4/5**
The manuscript is well-written and easy to follow, with a clear structure that makes it easy to understand the authors' points. The writing is generally good but could be improved in a few places.

## Clarity Assessment
**Score: 4/5**
I think this is the best section of the paper. It's very clear and concise, and the author does an excellent job of explaining the concepts. I would like to see more concrete examples or visualizations that can help illustrate the ideas better. The text could use a few more transitions between sentences. There are some places where it feels like the author is trying to cram too many ideas into one sentence, which makes them hard to follow. For example, "The writing is generally good but could be improved in a few places." I think this should be rephrased for clarity.

## Structure and Organization
**Score: 4/5**
The structure of the paper is very clear. The authors do an excellent job with organization. It's easy to follow their train of thought, and they don't get too far off track. There are some places where it feels like the author is trying to cram too many ideas into one paragraph or sentence, which makes them hard to follow. I think this should be rephrased for clarity.

## Technical Accuracy
**Score: 5/5**
The paper is very well written from a technical standpoint. The authors do an excellent job with explaining the concepts and providing examples. There are some places where they could make it easier to understand, but that's about it.

## Readability
**Score: 4/5**
I think this section should be expanded. I would like to see more concrete issues or references to specific sections of the paper. The text is easy to read and understand, but there are a few places where it could be improved for clarity.

## Specific Issues Found
The authors do an excellent job with organization. It's easy to follow their train of thought, and they don't get too far off track.

* In the "Overall Quality Score" section, it would be helpful if you could provide more detail about what specifically you would like to see in the manuscript. For example, you say that the writing is generally good but could be improved in a few places, but you don't give any specific examples.
* I think this paper needs to have a conclusion. The authors' main point is that the algorithm has some nice properties and should be considered for machine learning problems. This is not clearly stated at all. It would be helpful if the authors could summarize their findings in more detail.

## Recommendations
