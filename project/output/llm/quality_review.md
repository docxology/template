There are also some minor issues with sentence structure and word choice that could be improved upon.

## Specific Issues Found
The following are some specific issues found in the manuscript:

* The manuscript has a few minor errors with sentence structure and word choice. For example, there is an error in the first paragraph of the introduction where it says "the authors have been developing this algorithm for several years." It would be better to say "the authors have been working on this problem for some time." This is not just about the number of words used but also about how they are structured. The manuscript could use more subheadings and headings to make the text easier to follow.
