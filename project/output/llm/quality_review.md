**Overall Quality Score: 4/5**

The paper is well-structured and generally easy to follow, but there are some issues with clarity of presentation that detract from the overall score.

**Clarity Assessment: 3.75/5**

The manuscript is clear in terms of the mathematical derivations and theorems presented; however, the introduction and related sections could be improved for non-experts. The paper assumes a high level of prior knowledge about optimization methods. For example, it does not explain what an objective function is or why this is important to solve. It also uses technical jargon without definition (e.g., "convergence metrics" in section 3.1), which may be confusing for readers who are not familiar with the field. The paper could benefit from a glossary of terms at the end, especially if the authors wish to reach a broader audience than just optimization experts.

**Structure and Organization: 4/5**

The introduction is too short to provide context for the reader. The related work section should be expanded on the main results in the field that are not mentioned (e.g., the stochastic gradient descent method), as well as how this relates to other methods. This is particularly important if the authors wish to reach a broader audience than just optimization experts.

**Technical Accuracy: 5/5**

The paper is technically sound and accurate in its derivations of theorems. The main results are not new, but the presentation is clear and the proofs are correct. There is no issue with the content that I could find.

**Readability: 3.25/5**

There are a few places where there is confusion about what is being discussed (e.g., section 2.1), which may be due to the use of overly technical terms. The paper is generally well-written, but it could benefit from more attention to how the results will be received by readers who do not have a background in optimization.

**Specific Issues Found:**

* The introduction should provide context for the reader.
* The related work section needs to be expanded on the main results in the field that are not mentioned (e.g., the stochastic gradient descent method), as well as how this relates to other methods. This is particularly important if the authors wish to reach a broader audience than just optimization experts.
* The paper could benefit from more attention to how the results will be received by readers who do not have a background in optimization.

**Recommendations:**

1. Provide context for the reader, especially non-experts, in the introduction. This is particularly important if the authors wish to reach a broader audience than just optimization experts.
2. Expand on the main results in the related work section (e.g., the stochastic gradient descent method), as well as how this relates to other methods.
3. Pay more attention to how the results will be received by readers who do not have a background in optimization.
