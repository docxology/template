## Overall Quality Score
**Score: 4/5**

The manuscript is well-organized and easy to follow, with a clear introduction that sets the stage for the rest of the paper. The authors provide a helpful overview of their data collection process, which is also described in detail elsewhere (e.g., in the database section). The analysis of the ways data are presented is thorough and generally well done, although some of the statistical analyses could be improved upon. The manuscript would benefit from a more detailed discussion of the implications of the results.

## Clarity Assessment
**Score: 5/5**

The writing is clear and concise with no ambiguity in the meaning of the text. The authors provide enough information to understand their data collection process, but they do not explain it too much. They also present their analysis of the ways data in a way that is easy to follow. This is particularly true for the statistical analyses, which are presented in a clear and concise manner.

## Structure and Organization
**Score: 4/5**

The manuscript has an introduction that provides context for the rest of the paper. The authors then present their analysis of the ways data in a way that is easy to follow. This includes a section on the House of Knowledge, which is helpful because it is not immediately apparent from the title how this relates to the rest of the paper. The manuscript could be improved upon by providing more detail about the implications of the results.

## Technical Accuracy
**Score: 4/5**

The technical accuracy of the manuscript is generally good. However, there are a few issues that need to be addressed. First, it would have been helpful if the authors had provided an overview of the ways data in their analysis, which could have been done in the introduction or as part of the discussion section. The statistical analyses presented in this paper are not particularly complex and are well within the range of what a graduate student should know. However, there is no explanation for why these particular statistics were chosen. Second, it would be helpful if the authors had provided more detail about how they calculated their statistical measures (e.g., effect size). Third, the manuscript could have been improved upon by providing an overview of the ways data in their analysis, which could have been done in the introduction or as part of the discussion section.

## Specific Issues Found
The authors provide a clear overview of their data collection process in the introduction and database section. This includes information on the number of ways, the number of rooms, and the number of questions. They also present the ways data in the ways section. The statistical analyses presented are not particularly complex and are well within the range of what a graduate student should know. However, there is no explanation for why these particular statistics were chosen. This could be addressed by providing an overview of the ways data in their analysis, which could have been done in the introduction or as part of the discussion section.
