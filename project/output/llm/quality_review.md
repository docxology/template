## Overall Quality Score: **4/5**

The manuscript is well-written and easy to follow, but it could be improved with a few suggestions.

## Clarity Assessment: **5/5**

The writing is clear and concise. The authors have done an excellent job of explaining the methods and results in their manuscript. The figures are also very helpful for understanding the results. The only suggestion I would make here is that the text should be edited to remove any ambiguity or confusion.

## Structure and Organization: **4/5**

The organization of the paper is good, but there are a few places where it could be improved. For example, the introduction is short and does not provide enough context for the reader to understand the importance of the problem being addressed. The authors should expand on this section by providing more background information about the current state-of-the-art in this area and how their work addresses the gap that exists.

## Technical Accuracy: **4/5**

The technical accuracy is good, but there are a few places where it could be improved. For example, the authors do not provide enough detail for the reader to understand the results of the simulations they ran. The text should be edited to make sure that the reader can see what was done and why.

## Readability: **5/5**

The readability is excellent. I have no suggestions here.
