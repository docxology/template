**Overall Quality Score:** **4/5**

The manuscript is well-organized and provides a clear introduction to optimization algorithms, but it could be improved by providing more technical depth. The presentation is generally good, but there are some places where the language is too casual or unclear.

**Clarity Assessment:** **3.5/5**

The writing in this manuscript is mostly clear, with a few exceptions. For example, "the optimization algorithms we will discuss below" could be replaced by "the following optimization algorithms." The use of "we will see" and "it can be seen that" could be replaced by the actual results, as they do not add much value to the text and are somewhat vague. The manuscript is also missing a few definitions and explanations, but these are minor issues.

**Structure and Organization:** **4/5**

The organization of the manuscript is good, with a clear introduction, an overview of the main topics in each section, and a summary at the end. The main sections are well-organized and easy to follow. However, the manuscript could be improved by providing more technical depth, as it is written for an audience that is not familiar with optimization algorithms.

**Technical Accuracy:** **3/5**

The accuracy of this manuscript appears to be good, but there are a few places where the language is too casual or unclear. For example, "the optimization algorithms we will discuss below" could be replaced by "the following optimization algorithms." The use of "we will see" and "it can be seen that" could be replaced by the actual results, as they do not add much value to the text and are somewhat vague. There is also a missing definition for the term "stochastic average gradient," which is used in several places.

**Readability:** **4/5**

The writing in this manuscript is generally good, but there are some areas where it could be improved. The language is mostly clear, with a few exceptions. For example, "the optimization algorithms we will discuss below" could be replaced by "the following optimization algorithms." It appears that the manuscript was written for an audience that is not familiar with optimization algorithms.

**Specific Issues Found:**

The manuscript has a few places where it could be improved:

1. The use of "we will see" and "it can be seen that" are somewhat vague, as they do not add much value to the text and make it seem like the author is trying to hide something. For example, in the section on stochastic gradient descent, the manuscript states that "the stochastic average gradient method is very easy to implement." This could be replaced by a specific explanation of how to implement this algorithm.

2. The term "stochastic average gradient" is used several times without being defined, which is not good for an audience that may not be familiar with it.

3. In the section on stochastic gradient descent, the manuscript states that "the stochastic average gradient method is very easy to implement." This could be replaced by a specific explanation of how to implement this algorithm. The same issue applies to the other main optimization algorithms discussed in the manuscript.

4. The manuscript has some places where it is too casual or unclear. For example, the section on convergence analysis provides an overview and does not provide much technical depth. It would be better if there were more specific details provided about how to apply this algorithm.

5. In the section on stochastic gradient descent, the manuscript states that "we can see that the stochastic average gradient method is very easy to implement." This could be replaced by a specific explanation of how to implement this algorithm. The same issue applies to the other main optimization algorithms discussed in the manuscript.
