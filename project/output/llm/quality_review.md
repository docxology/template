## Overall Quality Score
**Score: 4/5**

The paper is well-written and easy to follow, but the writing could be more engaging. The authors have a good sense of what they are trying to do with their work, and it shows in the text. However, there are some issues that prevent this from being an excellent manuscript. First, the text does not always get to the point quickly enough. There is too much repetition in the text. For example, the authors spend a lot of time talking about what they did rather than why they did it or how it works. The paper could be more concise and focused on the main points. Second, the authors do not provide enough context for the reader to understand the work. It is not clear that this is an important problem in the field of machine learning. Third, the authors do not really explain what they are doing with their code. This is a paper about a new algorithm, and it should be explained well enough so that someone who does not know the details of the algorithm can understand why the authors did what they did. Fourth, there is no discussion of the results. The paper could benefit from more context. Finally, the authors do not really explain their conclusions. This is a very important part of any manuscript. It should be clear to the reader how the work relates to other work in the field and why it is important.

## Clarity Assessment
