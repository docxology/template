### Overall Quality Score
**Score: 4/5**
The overall quality of this manuscript is high, with the majority of the text being well-written and clear. The main issues are minor errors in grammar and sentence structure that do not detract from the content. 

### Clarity Assessment
**Score: 5/5**
The writing is generally very good and easy to follow. The authors have a good command of English, with only a few places where it could be improved. For example, the first paragraph in the introduction could be rephrased for better clarity. The sentence "For instance, consider a default project title" should perhaps be "Consider a default project title", and "for instance" is not necessary here. The text is also very dense with technical terms that may be unfamiliar to non-experts; it would be helpful if the authors could provide a glossary or list of abbreviations used in the manuscript, but this is not a major issue.
