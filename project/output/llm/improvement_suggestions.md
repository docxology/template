## Summary
The paper is well-written; however, there are a number of issues that should be addressed to improve its clarity and overall quality. The most important concerns include consistency in terminology, the need for more detail on the algorithm's convergence rate, and the lack of a clear comparison with other methods.

## High Priority Improvements
### Consistency in Terminology

The authors use both "training set" and "test set" to refer to what is typically called a "validation set." It would be better if they were consistent in their terminology. The first paragraph of the introduction states that the convergence rate for the algorithm is "unknown." This is correct, but it could be stated more clearly.

I suggest the following improvements:

* In the introduction, add a sentence to indicate that the authors are aware of the unknown nature of the convergence rate. For example: "The authors do not know how long the training process will take for any given problem."
* The last paragraph of the introduction should state this as well.
* When describing the experiments in the text, use "validation set" instead of "training set."

### Convergence Rate

In addition to knowing the convergence rate, it would be helpful if the authors could indicate a range within which the training time is likely to lie. The paper does not provide any guidance on this issue.

I suggest the following improvements:

* Add an example of how the training time might vary depending on the data and the algorithm.
* Provide some general guidance on when the authors expect the training time to be significantly longer than in the experiments, if it is at all.

### Comparison with Other Methods

The paper does not compare its results with those of other methods. This makes it diﬃcult for the reader to get a sense of how well this algorithm performs relative to others. The authors should include some comparisons so that the reader can better judge the quality of their results and also be able to evaluate the relative performance of the method.

I suggest the following improvements:

* In the introduction, state what other methods are being compared with this one.
* In the text after the table of contents, compare the results for this algorithm with those in the literature. The reader is given a sense of how well the algorithm performs relative to others by comparing it with the best known algorithms.

## Medium Priority Improvements

### Minor Details

The authors should check the manuscript for minor details such as missing words and punctuation errors. I suggest that they get someone else to review the paper for this purpose as there are many other issues that need attention.

I suggest the following improvements:

* Check the entire manuscript for minor details.
* The authors may want to consider adding some minor details, such as including a reference list.
* If the authors include any tables or figures, they should be sure that these are properly formatted and placed in the paper. The table of contents does not indicate what is in each section.

## Low Priority Improvements

### Citation Style

The references use an outdated citation style. They do not follow the 2024 guidelines for citing research papers.
I suggest the following improvements:

* Update the citation style to conform to the 2024 guidelines.

## Overall Recommendation
I suggest that this manuscript should be accepted with major revisions based on my suggestions above. This is because it has some minor issues that need to be addressed. It has a number of other issues, such as the lack of comparison with other methods and the limited detail provided on the training time, but if these are resolved, I think the authors will have a well-written paper.
