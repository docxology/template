## Summary

The manuscript is well-written and provides a good overview of the improvements needed to make it more publishable. The author has made an attempt to include all types of improvements, although there are some inconsistencies in the format and wording used throughout the manuscript. It would be helpful if the author could provide a clear explanation as to why they have written this way, so that the reviewer can better understand their reasoning and suggestions for future manuscripts.

## High Priority Improvements

### WHAT: The paper is well-organized but has some minor problems with its organization. Some of the sections are too short or too long when compared to others in the manuscript. For example, the "Overall Recommendation" section is very short compared to the other two high-priority suggestions and could be expanded upon. Also, it would be helpful if there was a clear explanation for why the author has decided that one suggestion is higher than the other.

### WHY: The main reason why this paper should not be accepted with minor revisions is because of its low quality in content. It does not seem to be written by an expert in the field. The authors have provided no background information on their work and do not explain or justify their algorithms, so it is difficult for readers to understand their work. Also, there are some inconsistencies in the manuscript that make it hard to follow. For example, the "Low Priority Improvements" section seems to be a combination of "High Priority Improvements" and "Medium Priority Improvements". The author could have provided a clear explanation as to why they are making such suggestions.

### HOW: The authors should provide more background information on their work. This could be done by including some literature review in the introduction or the related work section. It would also be helpful if the authors explained the reasons for their algorithms and how it was different from others. Also, the author should explain why they have suggested that one suggestion is higher than the other.

## Medium Priority Improvements

### WHAT: The manuscript needs to be proofread more carefully because there are some minor errors in the text such as missing articles and incorrect capitalization of "it". It would also be helpful if the authors could provide a clear explanation for why they have suggested that one suggestion is higher than the other. Also, it would be better if the author could include an example or two to make their point more understandable.

## Low Priority Improvements

### WHAT: The paper does not follow the standard format of a research paper in the field. This could be done by including an abstract or summary at the beginning of the manuscript. The authors have also failed to include some relevant information that are needed for a manuscript. For example, they do not provide any information on how their work is related to other papers.
