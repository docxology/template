Okay, here’s a detailed review and improvement suggestion for the provided manuscript, adhering to all the specified requirements and constraints.

## Summary

The manuscript presents a comprehensive synthesis of tree grafting science and practice, aiming to provide a practical toolkit for researchers and practitioners. While the content is well-structured and covers a broad range of topics, several areas could benefit from focused refinement. Specifically, the manuscript needs enhanced clarity in translating complex biological mechanisms into actionable recommendations, increased emphasis on validation strategies, and improved integration of the simulation framework. Addressing these points will significantly strengthen the manuscript’s impact and usability.

## High Priority Improvements

1. **Clarify Compatibility Models:** The current description of the compatibility models (phylogenetic distance, cambium match, growth rate match) lacks explicit quantification and connection to success rates. The manuscript needs to provide more detailed metrics (e.g., correlation coefficients, standard deviation of success rates) and illustrate how these factors contribute to the overall probability of graft success. *WHY:* Without clear metrics, the models appear theoretical and difficult to apply. *HOW:* Add specific numerical values and examples illustrating the influence of each factor.

2. **Strengthen Validation Framework:** The manuscript mentions a validation framework but doesn't detail the methods employed. It needs a more robust description of how the simulation results are validated against real-world grafting outcomes. *WHY:* The credibility of the models depends on rigorous validation. *HOW:* Describe the types of experiments conducted, the metrics used to assess model accuracy, and the statistical methods employed.

3. **Expand on Environmental Factor Influence:** The discussion of environmental factors (temperature, humidity) is somewhat superficial. Quantify the impact of these factors on graft success and provide specific recommendations for optimizing environmental conditions. *WHY:* Environmental factors are crucial for graft success and require a more detailed analysis. *HOW:* Add data on the correlation between environmental variables and graft success rates, and provide specific temperature and humidity ranges for optimal grafting.

## Medium Priority Improvements

4. **Refine Technique Descriptions:** The descriptions of grafting techniques (whip and tongue, cleft, bark) are somewhat brief. Adding more detailed step-by-step instructions, including recommended tools and techniques, would improve usability. *WHY:* Practical application requires precise guidance. *HOW:* Expand each technique description with detailed instructions and illustrations.

5. **Enhance Simulation Output:** The manuscript could benefit from more detailed simulation outputs, including graphs and tables illustrating the temporal dynamics of graft healing and the influence of key parameters. *WHY:* Visualizing simulation results enhances understanding and facilitates model validation. *HOW:* Generate more comprehensive simulation outputs, including graphs of callus formation, vascular connection, and overall graft health.

6. **Improve Integration of the Toolkit:** The manuscript needs to provide a clearer explanation of how the various components of the toolkit (compatibility prediction, simulation, statistical analysis) are integrated to provide a holistic solution. *WHY:* The value of the toolkit depends on seamless integration. *HOW:* Add a diagram illustrating the workflow and data flow between the different components.

## Low Priority Improvements

7. **Expand Glossary:** The API symbols glossary is sparse. Adding more details about the function parameters and return values would improve usability. *WHY:* Clarity is key for developers. *HOW:* Expand the glossary with more detailed information about each function.

8. **Refine Formatting:** Some sections could benefit from minor formatting adjustments to improve readability (e.g., bullet points, numbered lists). *WHY:* Improved readability enhances user experience. *HOW:* Implement minor formatting changes to improve the visual appeal and clarity of the manuscript.

## Overall Recommendation

**Accept with Major Revisions**. The manuscript presents a valuable synthesis of tree grafting knowledge, but significant revisions are necessary to enhance clarity, strengthen validation, and improve the practical usability of the toolkit. Addressing the high-priority improvements outlined above will substantially improve the manuscript’s impact and credibility.
