## Summary

The manuscript provides a good overview of the paper and its main ideas, but it is not very detailed in highlighting the specific contributions of the paper. It would be better if there are some concrete examples or more details to explain what the authors have done to improve the current state-of-the-art methods. The overall structure of the manuscript is clear, but it may be a little bit too long and a few sentences should be cut for a better flow.
