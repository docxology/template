## Summary

The paper is well-written, but there are several areas that can be improved to make it more impactful. This manuscript review will provide a list of the most important issues with the highest priority first.

## High Priority Improvements

### 1. **Clearly state the main contributions**

The authors should clearly state what they have accomplished in their paper and why this is an important contribution. The paper is not clear about the main contribution, but it seems to be related to the comparison of Adam variants with a baseline method (SGD). In the introduction section, the authors mention that there are many different optimization algorithms for training neural networks, but they do not provide any specific information on what their algorithm does differently than existing methods. The paper should clearly state how the new algorithm is better and why this is important.

### 2. **Provide more details about the baseline method**

The authors should describe the baseline method in more detail. In the manuscript, there are many different Adam variants that are compared to each other, but it does not provide any information on what makes them different from SSGD. The paper should clearly state how the new algorithm is better than the baseline and why this is important.

### 3. **More details about the data**

The authors should describe the training data in more detail. What are the characteristics of the data? How does this affect the performance of the Adam variants? It would be helpful if the authors could provide some information on what makes their data different from other data sets that have been used to compare Adam with SSGD.

### 4. **More details about the experimental results**

The authors should describe the experimental results in more detail. What are the main differences between the Adam variants? How do these differences affect the performance of the algorithm? The paper does not discuss why the performance difference is observed, but it seems that the best variant of Adam is always better than SSGD.

### 5. **More details about the evaluation metrics**

The authors should describe the evaluation metrics in more detail. What are the main differences between the different Adam variants? How do these differences affect the performance of the algorithm?

## Medium Priority Improvements

### 1. **Provide a clearer explanation of the Adam variants**

The authors should provide a clear and detailed explanation of what makes each Adam variant different from the others. The paper does not explain why one method is better than another, but it seems that the best variant is always better than SSGD.

## Low Priority Improvements

### 1. **More details about the related work**

The authors should provide more information on the related work. What are the main differences between their approach and previous approaches? The paper does not discuss why this novel approach is necessary or important, but it seems that the new algorithm is better than SSGD.
