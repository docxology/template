Okay, here’s a detailed review of the manuscript, structured according to your requirements.

## Summary

The manuscript presents a novel optimization framework combining theoretical rigor with practical efficiency. The core contribution lies in a unified approach combining regularization, adaptive step sizes, and momentum techniques. The framework achieves linear convergence with rate (0, 1) and optimal O(n log n) complexity per iteration, validated through extensive experimentation. The manuscript demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scalability and computational efficiency.  The key strengths are the theoretical guarantees and the experimental validation, but the documentation could benefit from more detailed explanations of the implementation choices.

## High Priority Improvements

The manuscript’s theoretical claims, particularly regarding the convergence rate (0, 1) and O(n log n) complexity, require significant strengthening.  Specifically, Section 3.1 states a theoretical convergence guarantee, but this needs more rigorous justification.  The convergence rate is dependent on the assumption of strong convexity, as stated in Beck and Teboulle [2009], but this is not explicitly stated.  Furthermore, the experimental results, while promising, lack a detailed analysis of the impact of the step size and momentum parameters.  The manuscript needs to clearly articulate *why* the adaptive step size strategy (3.5) is effective and provide a more quantitative assessment of its influence on convergence.  The “robustness” claim (94.3% success rate) needs more context – what constitutes a “success” and what is the distribution of failure cases?  The description of the benchmark datasets (Section 4.2) is also insufficient; providing details about the problem sizes and characteristics would enhance the reproducibility and comparability of the results.  Finally, the manuscript needs to explicitly state the assumptions underpinning the experimental validation, particularly regarding the problem types considered.

## Medium Priority Improvements

The manuscript’s documentation could be improved by providing more detailed explanations of the implementation choices.  For example, the choice of the adaptive step size strategy (3.5) could be elaborated upon, including a discussion of the rationale behind selecting this approach over other options.  Similarly, the description of the data preprocessing steps (Section 4.1) could be expanded to include more details about the normalization methods employed. The manuscript would benefit from a more thorough discussion of the limitations of the framework, particularly regarding the assumptions made about the problem structure and the sensitivity of the results to parameter variations.  The description of the “robustness” claim (94.3% success rate) needs more context – what constitutes a “success” and what is the distribution of failure cases?  The manuscript would benefit from a more thorough discussion of the limitations of the framework, particularly regarding the assumptions made about the problem structure and the sensitivity of the results to parameter variations.

## Low Priority Improvements

The manuscript’s presentation could be enhanced by incorporating more visual aids, such as figures illustrating the convergence behavior of the algorithm. The manuscript could also benefit from a more formal definition of the key terms and concepts used throughout the document. The manuscript could benefit from a more thorough discussion of the limitations of the framework, particularly regarding the assumptions made about the problem structure and the sensitivity of the results to parameter variations.

## Overall Recommendation

**Accept with Major Revisions**. The manuscript demonstrates a promising optimization framework with solid experimental validation. However, the theoretical justification for the convergence rate and the lack of detailed analysis of the implementation choices require substantial revisions. Addressing the high-priority improvements outlined above is crucial to strengthening the manuscript's credibility and impact.  Specifically, the convergence analysis needs a more rigorous mathematical foundation, and the experimental results require more detailed reporting and analysis.
