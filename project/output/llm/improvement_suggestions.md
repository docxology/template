## Summary

The paper provides a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art optimization algorithms for machine learning. The author's main goal is to provide an extensive survey of various optimization techniques that can be used in different scenarios, with the aim of helping practitioners and researchers choose appropriate methods according to their specific needs. The paper also highlights potential research directions.

## High Priority Improvements

The first improvement I would like to suggest is to add a section on "Related Work" at the end of the manuscript. This section should provide an overview of the current state-of-the-art optimization techniques that have been used in machine learning and their performance comparisons. The paper does not contain any direct comparison between different optimization algorithms, but it could be helpful for the readers if they can see how the discussed algorithms compare with each other in terms of their performance on the same task. This is especially true when a new researcher or practitioner wants to apply an algorithm that has been used by others before. The section should contain a brief description of the related work, and it could be helpful if the authors can provide some references for further reading.

The second improvement I would like to suggest is to add more details on the performance comparison between different optimization algorithms in terms of their convergence speed and their ability to escape from local minima. The paper does not contain any direct comparison between different optimization algorithms, but it could be helpful if the authors can provide some references for further reading.
