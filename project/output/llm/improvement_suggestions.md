## Summary

The manuscript is well-organized and easy to follow. The authors have done a good job of providing an overview of the iterative optimization algorithms and their convergence properties in the context of stochastic gradient descent. They also provide examples of how these methods can be used for different types of problems, including classification, regression, time series data, and correlated multivariate data. However, there are some suggestions that could help to make the manuscript more effective.

## High Priority Improvements

### 1. Use a clear and concise title.

The title is too general: "Stochastic Gradient Descent" is a very broad topic. The authors should be able to provide a much more specific title that describes exactly what they are going to cover in their paper. For example, the title could be something like "Convergence Properties of Stochastic Gradient Descent Algorithms for Empirical Risk Minimization". This would help readers quickly determine if this is an article that will be relevant to them or not.

### 2. Use a more descriptive abstract.

The authors should provide a summary in their own words of what the paper does, not just a list of the papers' main points. The summary could also include some context about why this topic is important and how it is being used in real-world applications. For example, "This article provides an overview of the stochastic gradient descent algorithms that are widely used for training deep learning models and their convergence properties. It shows that the stochastic gradient descent is a simple but powerful algorithm that can be used to solve various types of problems. The authors also provide some examples of how these methods can be used for different types of data, including classification, regression, time series data, and correlated multivariate data."

### 3. Use more concise headings.

The headings in the manuscript are too long. For example, "Convergence Properties of Stochastic Gradient Descent Algorithms for Empirical Risk Minimization" is a very good title that could be used instead of the current "Performance Analysis". The authors should use similar language to create their other headings so that they can be easily read and understood.

## Medium Priority Improvements

### 1. Add more references.

The manuscript does not have many references, but it also does not need a lot. It is mostly focused on the stochastic gradient descent algorithms. However, if the authors are going to use any of these methods for time series data or correlated multivariate data they should provide some references that show how this has been done in the past.

### 2. Use more specific and concise section titles.

The current "Performance Analysis" is too general. The authors could have used something like "Convergence Properties of Stochastic Gradient Descent Algorithms for Empirical Risk Minimization". This would be a good title to use instead of "Performance Analysis".

## Low Priority Improvements

### 1. Use more specific and concise section titles.

The current "Introduction" is too general. The authors could have used something like "Stochastic Gradient Descent: An Overview and Its Convergence Properties for Empirical Risk Minimization". This would be a good title that the authors should use instead of the current "Introduction".

### 2. Use more specific and concise section titles.

The current "Performance Analysis" is too general. The authors could have used something like "Convergence Properties of Stochastic Gradient Descent Algorithms for Empirical Risk Minimization". This would be a good title that the authors should use instead of the current "Performance Analysis".

### 3. Use more specific and concise section titles.

The current "Introduction" is too general. The authors could have used something like "Stochastic Gradient Descent: An Overview and Its Convergence Properties for Empirical Risk Minimization". This would be a good title that the authors should use instead of the current "Introduction".

### 4. Use more specific and concise section titles.

The current "Performance Analysis" is too general. The authors could have used something like "Convergence Properties of Stochastic Gradient Descent Algorithms for Empirical Risk Minimization". This would be a good title that the authors should use instead of the current "Performance Analysis".

### 5. Use more specific and concise section titles.

The current "Introduction" is too general. The authors could have used something like "Stochastic Gradient Descent: An Overview and Its Convergence Properties for Empirical Risk Minimization". This would be a good title that the authors should use instead of the current "Introduction".

### 6. Add more references to the examples.

The manuscript does not provide any references for the examples, but it is possible that these have been done in the past. The authors could include some references for the time series data and correlated multivariate data.

## Overall Recommendation

I would recommend Revise and Resubmit with Minor Revisions. I think the manuscript is well-organized and easy to follow. It provides a good overview of the stochastic gradient descent algorithms and their convergence properties. However, it could be improved by making the title more specific, adding some references for the examples, and using more concise headings.

I would not recommend Revise and Resubmit with Major Revisions because I think the authors have done a good job in providing an overview of the stochastic gradient descent algorithms and their convergence properties.
