Okay, here’s a detailed review of the manuscript, structured according to your specifications.

## Summary

The manuscript presents a novel optimization framework combining theoretical rigor with practical efficiency. The core algorithm, described as a combination of regularization, adaptive step sizes, and momentum techniques, aims to achieve both theoretical convergence guarantees and superior experimental performance. The key contributions lie in a unified approach, demonstrated through extensive experimentation across diverse problem domains. While the framework shows promise, several areas require refinement to enhance clarity, rigor, and overall impact. Specifically, the description of the algorithm’s theoretical guarantees needs further elaboration, the experimental results could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the convergence rates, and the overall presentation could be improved for greater clarity and impact.

## High Priority Improvements

The most critical issues revolve around the clarity and depth of the theoretical justification and the presentation of the experimental results. Firstly, the description of the convergence rate ( 3.4) requires significant elaboration. The current statement is too brief and lacks the necessary mathematical detail to fully understand the convergence guarantees. *WHAT*: The convergence rate needs a more thorough explanation, including the precise conditions under which the rate is achieved. *WHY*: Without a clear understanding of the convergence rate, the theoretical claims lack credibility and practical value. *HOW*: Expand section 3.1 to include a formal derivation of the convergence rate, referencing relevant theorems from convex optimization literature.  Secondly, the experimental results require a more detailed analysis. *WHAT*: The convergence rates are presented as numbers without context. *WHY*: Without understanding the convergence rates, it’s difficult to assess the algorithm’s performance relative to other methods. *HOW*: Add a section (e.g., 4.2) that discusses the convergence rates in detail, comparing them to theoretical predictions and other state-of-the-art methods. Include a table summarizing the convergence rates for various problem instances. Finally, the description of the adaptive step size rule ( 3.5) needs to be clarified. *WHAT*: The rule is described vaguely. *WHY*: This is a key component of the algorithm, and its implementation details are not fully explained. *HOW*: Provide a more precise mathematical formulation of the step size rule, including the conditions under which it is applied.

## Medium Priority Improvements

The manuscript could benefit from a more detailed description of the experimental setup and the benchmark datasets used. *WHAT*: The current description of the datasets is brief. *WHY*: This is important for reproducibility and allows readers to assess the algorithm’s performance on different types of problems. *HOW*: Add a section (e.g., 4.1) that provides a detailed description of the datasets, including their characteristics and sizes. Also, include a table summarizing the datasets used in the experiments. Furthermore, the algorithm’s implementation details could be improved. *WHAT*: The algorithm is described in a high-level manner. *WHY*: This makes it difficult to understand how the algorithm works in practice. *HOW*: Add pseudocode for the algorithm to make it easier to understand.  The manuscript’s overall structure could be improved. *WHAT*: The sections are somewhat disjointed. *WHY*: This makes it difficult to follow the algorithm’s development. *HOW*: Consider restructuring the manuscript to follow a more logical flow, starting with the theoretical framework and then moving on to the experimental results.

## Low Priority Improvements

The manuscript could benefit from a more visually appealing presentation. *WHAT*: The manuscript is text-heavy. *WHY*: This makes it difficult to read and understand. *HOW*: Consider adding more figures and diagrams to illustrate the algorithm’s key concepts. The manuscript could also benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations of the algorithm. *WHAT*: The limitations are not explicitly discussed. *WHY*: This is important for providing a balanced assessment of the algorithm’s strengths and weaknesses. *HOW*: Add a section (e.g., 6.3) that discusses the limitations of the algorithm and suggests potential areas for future research.

## Overall Recommendation

**Accept with Major Revisions**. The manuscript presents a promising optimization framework with several key contributions. However, significant revisions are required to enhance the clarity, rigor, and impact of the work. Specifically, the theoretical justification needs substantial elaboration, the experimental results require a more detailed analysis, and the overall presentation could be improved for greater clarity and impact. Addressing these issues will significantly strengthen the manuscript and increase its value to the research community.
