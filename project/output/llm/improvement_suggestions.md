## Summary

The manuscript is well-organized and presents a clear and concise overview of the free energy principle (FEP) as an alternative to traditional statistical mechanics. The FEP has been a topic of interest in recent years, with the authors presenting their own work in this area and making it accessible to those without extensive background knowledge. However, there are a few areas that could be improved for better organization and clarity.

## High Priority Improvements

### Improve the Introduction

The introduction is very important as it sets the stage for the rest of the manuscript. It should clearly present what the FEP is and why it may be more fundamental than traditional statistical mechanics. The first sentence of the current introduction says that "the free energy principle (FEP) has long been considered the most basic theory in statistical physics." While this is true, the authors could have started with a more general statement such as "Statistical physics is built on top of the foundation of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics," which would then lead to the FEP. This gives the reader an idea of what they are about to learn. The introduction should also clearly state that the purpose of this manuscript is to present some new results in this area. It is also important to mention that the authors will be presenting a different perspective on the FEP than traditional statistical mechanics, which could make it more accessible and interesting for readers who may not have read these previous works.

The introduction should also have a clear statement about what the reader can expect from the manuscript, i.e., what are the main results? What do the authors hope that the reader will take away after reading this manuscript?

#### Why: The authors could have started with a more general statement than "the free energy principle (FEP) has long been considered the most basic theory in statistical physics." This would help to give the reader an idea of what they are about to learn. They should also clearly state that the purpose of this manuscript is to present some new results in this area and what do the authors hope that the reader will take away after reading this manuscript?

#### How: The authors can try to make a clear statement about what the reader can expect from the manuscript at the beginning. This could be done by stating something like "This manuscript presents an overview of the FEP, its history and how it is different than traditional statistical mechanics." 

## Medium Priority Improvements

### Clarify the use of the term "thermodynamic" in Section 1.2

The authors use the term "thermodynamic" to describe the "traditional foundation" in a few places throughout the manuscript. It would be helpful if they could define this term at the beginning of the introduction and explain that it is being used in a different sense than the usual thermodynamics. The current paper deals with the "free energy principle," which has nothing to do with the free energy. This may cause confusion for some readers.

#### Why: The authors use the term "thermodynamic" to describe the "traditional foundation." While this is true, the authors could have started with a more general statement than "the free energy principle (FEP) has long been considered the most basic theory in statistical physics." This would help the reader get an idea of what they are about to learn. They should also clearly state that the purpose of this manuscript is to present some new results in this area and what do the authors hope that the reader will take away after reading this manuscript?

This could be done by stating something like "This manuscript presents an overview of the FEP, its history and how it is different than traditional statistical mechanics." 

### Be more precise in Section 1.3

The authors use the term "FPE" but do not define it. The current paper deals with the free energy principle (FEP), so the reader may be confused by the use of this abbreviation. It would also be helpful to have a clear statement about what the reader can expect from the manuscript.

#### Why: The authors use the term "thermodynamic." This is true, but they could have started with a more general statement than "the free energy principle (FEP) has long been considered the most basic theory in statistical physics." This would help to give the reader an idea of what they are about to learn.

### Provide more context for Section 3

The authors use the term "thermodynamic" to describe the "traditional foundation." While this is true, the authors could have started with a more general statement than "the free energy principle (FEP) has long been considered the most basic theory in statistical physics." This would help to give the reader an idea of what they are about to learn.

### Improve the presentation in Section 4

The section on variational principles is not well-organized as it jumps around between different topics such as the use of time averages. The text could be reorganized to make a more logical flow of ideas.

#### Why: The authors start with a clear statement about what the reader can expect from this manuscript, i.e., an overview of the FEP and its history. They then present some new results in this area. It would have been helpful if they had organized their presentation into different sections such as "variational principles" to make it easier for the reader to follow. This is especially important when presenting a new approach such as the authors' use of boundary logic.

#### How: The authors can try to reorganize the text in this section to provide a more logical flow of ideas. 

### Improve the presentation in Section 5

The section on "FPE" could be called something like "the FEP and traditional statistical mechanics." This would make it clear that the reader is about to learn the difference between these two approaches.

#### Why: The authors start with a clear statement about what the reader can expect from this manuscript, i.e., an overview of the FEP and its history.

### Be more precise in Section 6

The authors state that "the FEP has been around for decades." This is true, but they could have started with a statement about how long ago it was first presented. The reader may be confused by the use of this term, i.e., what does the abbreviation FPE stand for? They should also provide more context in this section such as describing the authors' own work and how it relates to the previous literature on the subject.

## Other Improvements

### Improve the References

The references are not well-organized, with some being listed as "References" and others as "Further Reading." This could be confusing for readers who may want to use the authors' reference list.

#### Why: The manuscripts are not well-organized in terms of how the references are presented. Some are listed as "References" while others are listed as "Further Reading." This could be confusing for readers who may want to use the authors' reference list. 

#### How: It would be better if the references were all organized together, without any subheadings or if they were only listed under one heading such as "References."
