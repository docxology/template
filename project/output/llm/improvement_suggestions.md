## Summary

The manuscript is well-organized and easy to follow, but there are a few areas that could be improved upon. The main issues lie in the writing style, organization, and the presentation of the results.

## High Priority Improvements

### 1. Writing Style

The writing style is very formal which makes it difficult for non-experts to read. The manuscript should be more concise with short sentences. It would also help if the abstract was rewritten to include some of the main points from the introduction and conclusion, as well as a brief overview of what the paper does.

### 2. Organization

The manuscript is very long which makes it difficult for readers to follow. There are too many figures and tables that do not add much value to the text. The results section should be organized in a more logical manner, with the main points from the introduction being summarized first, then the results of the experiments, and finally the conclusion.

### 3. Presentation

The presentation is very good, but the paper could benefit if there was a brief summary at the beginning of each section that explained what it would cover. The abstract should also be rewritten to include some of the main points from the introduction and conclusion as well as a brief overview of what the paper does.

## Medium Priority Improvements

### 1. Introduction

The manuscript could benefit if there was a clear statement about what the paper is going to do, which would help readers understand the purpose of the paper before they read it. The abstract should also be rewritten to include some of the main points from the introduction and conclusion as well as a brief overview of what the paper does.

### 2. Results

The results section could benefit if there was a clear statement about what the section is going to cover, which would help readers understand the purpose of the section before they read it. The presentation of the results should also be more concise with short sentences. There are too many tables and figures that do not add much value to the text. The conclusion could benefit if there was a clear statement about what the paper does, as well as some of the main points from the introduction.
