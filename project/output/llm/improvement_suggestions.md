Okay, here’s a detailed review of the manuscript, structured according to your requirements.

## Summary

This manuscript presents a novel optimization framework combining theoretical rigor with practical efficiency. The core contribution lies in a unified approach combining regularization, adaptive step sizes, and momentum techniques, offering both convergence guarantees and superior experimental performance. The framework’s key strengths are its linear complexity, scalability to large problems, and demonstrated success across diverse benchmark datasets. However, the manuscript lacks sufficient detail regarding the specific implementation choices, the theoretical justification for the adaptive step size strategy, and a more thorough exploration of potential limitations.  The presented results, while promising, require further validation and a more robust discussion of the practical considerations for deploying this framework.

## High Priority Improvements

The manuscript needs significant improvements to strengthen its theoretical foundation and experimental validation. First, the adaptive step size strategy (Section 3.3) requires more detailed justification. While it’s stated to ensure numerical stability, the specific mathematical basis for this choice is not clearly articulated.  *WHAT*: The adaptive step size is insufficiently explained. *WHY*: Without a solid mathematical foundation, the reader cannot assess the robustness and optimality of the approach. *HOW*:  Add a section (e.g., Section 3.4) explicitly detailing the adaptive step size rule, including the underlying assumptions and convergence properties.

Second, the manuscript needs a more rigorous discussion of the convergence guarantees. While the linear convergence rate is stated (Section 3.1), the conditions under which this rate is achieved are not fully explored. *WHAT*: The convergence rate is presented without sufficient theoretical backing. *WHY*:  A lack of detail weakens the credibility of the framework. *HOW*:  Expand Section 3.1 to include a more detailed analysis of the convergence rate, explicitly stating the assumptions required for linear convergence and providing a more precise bound on the error.

Third, the experimental results require more comprehensive analysis. While the manuscript reports success rates and performance metrics, it lacks a detailed breakdown of the results across diﬀerent problem types. *WHAT*: The results are presented without sufficient statistical analysis. *WHY*:  Without a deeper understanding of the performance characteristics, it's difficult to assess the framework’s generalizability. *HOW*:  Add a section (e.g., Section 4.4) that provides a more granular analysis of the results, including statistical measures (e.g., standard deviation, confidence intervals) and a comparison of performance across diﬀerent problem types.

## Medium Priority Improvements

The manuscript could benefit from enhanced clarity in describing the implementation details. The description of the algorithm in Section 3.3 is somewhat sparse, lacking specific details about the data structures used and the computations performed. *WHAT*: The algorithm description is lacking specific details. *WHY*: This makes it difficult to reproduce the results and assess the computational complexity. *HOW*:  Add a more detailed pseudocode representation of the algorithm in an appendix or a supplementary material section.

The manuscript would be strengthened by a more thorough discussion of potential limitations. While the authors acknowledge that the convergence guarantees require certain assumptions, this section could be expanded to include a more detailed discussion of other potential limitations, such as sensitivity to hyperparameters and the impact of noise. *WHAT*: The discussion of limitations is limited. *WHY*: This limits the framework's practical applicability. *HOW*: Add a section (e.g., Section 6.1) that explicitly outlines the limitations of the framework and suggests potential mitigation strategies.

## Low Priority Improvements

The formatting of the figures could be improved. The figure in Section 2.5 is somewhat cluttered and lacks clear labels. *WHAT*: The figure is poorly formatted. *WHY*: This reduces readability and hinders understanding. *HOW*:  Reformat the figure with clearer labels and a more concise presentation of the data.

The manuscript could benefit from a more detailed explanation of the data validation pipeline (Section 4.4). *WHAT*: The data validation pipeline is not fully explained. *WHY*: This reduces transparency. *HOW*:  Provide a more detailed description of the data validation steps, including the criteria used to identify and handle invalid data.

## Overall Recommendation

**Accept with Major Revisions**

This manuscript presents a promising optimization framework with a solid theoretical foundation and encouraging experimental results. However, significant revisions are required to strengthen the theoretical justification, enhance the clarity of the implementation details, and provide a more comprehensive analysis of the results. Addressing the high-priority improvements outlined above is essential to fully realize the potential of this work. The framework’s core ideas warrant further exploration, but the current manuscript requires substantial refinement before it can be considered a definitive contribution to the field.
