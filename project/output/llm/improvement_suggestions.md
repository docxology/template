## Summary

The manuscript is well-written, but there are a few areas that could be improved to make it more effective in conveying the authors' ideas and addressing the readers' needs. The main areas for improvement are:
1. The title does not accurately convey the content of the paper.
2. The introduction is too brief.
3. There are a couple of places where the presentation could be clarified.
4. Some of the sentences are unclear, but this is likely due to the fact that the manuscript was generated by an AI.

## High Priority Improvements

### WHAT: The title does not accurately convey the content of the paper.

The title "Example Default Project Title" does not give any idea about what the manuscript will cover. It should be more descriptive and provide a clear indication of the main topic(s) that will be covered in the paper. For example, it could be something like "A Survey of Proximal Gradient Methods for Stochastic Optimization". This would make it easier to determine if this is a paper you want to read or not.

### WHY: The title does not accurately convey the content of the paper.

The main purpose of a title is to give a clear indication of what the manuscript will cover. A person reading the title should have some idea about what they are going to learn from it. This could be something like "A Survey of Proximal Gradient Methods for Stochastic Optimization". The current title does not convey any information that would make you want to read this paper.

### HOW: Change the title.

## Medium Priority Improvements

### WHAT: The introduction is too brief.

The manuscript starts with a very short introduction. It could be expanded to provide more context and give an overview of what will be covered in the rest of the paper. This would help readers understand how the information in the paper fits into the larger picture. For example, it could explain why this topic is important or what are some of the key challenges that the authors address in their work.

### WHY: The introduction is too brief.

The main purpose of an introduction is to provide context for the rest of the manuscript. It should give readers a sense of how the information in the paper fits into the larger picture. This could be something like "A Survey of Proximal Gradient Methods for Stochastic Optimization". A short introduction would not give enough information about why this topic is important or what are some of the key challenges that the authors address in their work.

### HOW: Expand the introduction to provide more context and an overview of what will be covered in the rest of the paper. This could explain why this topic is important, what are some of the key challenges that the authors address in their work, or how the information in the paper fits into the larger picture.

## Low Priority Improvements

### WHAT: Some of the sentences are unclear but this is likely due to the fact that the manuscript was generated by an AI.

The text in the manuscript does not always follow a clear subject-verb-object structure. This could be due to the AI, and it would make the text easier to read if these issues were addressed. For example, "A fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm for linear inverse problems" is unclear because "fast" is an adjective that can refer to many different things. The authors should try to avoid using vague terms in their writing.

### WHY: Some of the sentences are unclear but this is likely due to the fact that the manuscript was generated by an AI.

The main purpose of a sentence is to convey information. If it does not do so, then the reader will have trouble understanding what you want to say. The text could be rewritten in a way that makes the meaning clearer. For example, "A fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm for linear inverse problems" is unclear because "fast" is an adjective that can refer to many different things. The authors should try to avoid using vague terms in their writing.

### HOW: Rewrite some of the sentences so that they are more clear and concise. This could be something like "A fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm for linear inverse problems". There is only one sentence that could be rewritten, but it would make the text easier to read if this were done. The main purpose of a title is to give a clear indication of what the manuscript will cover.

### WHAT: The authors should try to avoid using vague terms in their writing.

The main purpose of an introduction is to provide context for the rest of the paper. It should give readers a sense of how the information in the paper fits into the larger picture. This could be something like "A Survey of Proximal Gradient Methods for Stochastic Optimization". The current title does not convey any information that would make you want to read this paper.
