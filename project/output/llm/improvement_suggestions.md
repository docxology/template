## Summary
The manuscript is well-written and the ideas are clearly presented. The authors have done a great job of summarizing their work in this manuscript, but there are some areas that could be improved upon to make it even better.

## High Priority Improvements
### 1. Provide more detail on the datasets used for evaluation (Medium priority)
The authors discuss the accuracy of their method on several datasets. However, they do not provide much information about these datasets except for the number of samples and features in each dataset. It is important to know if there are any missing values in the data and what kind of imputation methods were used to fill them. The nature of the target variable (e.g., binary or multiclass) should also be reported.

#### Why it matters:
The data quality could have a great impact on the performance of their method. If the datasets have many missing values, the missing value imputation may affect the result. If the target variable is not binary and has more than two classes, some metrics such as accuracy would not make sense to compare them.

#### How to address it:
The authors can provide the information about the data preprocessing in Section 2.1. The datasets used for evaluation should be reported in Table 1 or Table 2.
### 2. More detail on the hyperparameter tuning (Medium priority)
The authors tune a few hyperparameters, but they do not give more details about how to choose these parameters. They can add some tables or figures to show this information.

#### Why it matters:
Without enough information about the parameter tuning process, the reader may not know if there are other better choices of the parameters. The number of epochs for training is also important and should be reported in the paper.

#### How to address it:
The authors can add some tables or figures to show this information.
### 3. More detail on the experimental design (Medium priority)
The authors provide more details about the experimental design as they go along, but there are still a few places that could be improved upon. It is important to know if the number of epochs for training is fixed and if it is different for different datasets.

#### Why it matters:
If the number of epochs for training is not fixed and it is different for different datasets, this may affect the performance of their method. The reader should know that the experimental design could be improved upon.
#### How to address it:
The authors can add some details about the parameter tuning process in Section 2.1. It is important to know if the number of epochs for training is fixed and if it is different for different datasets.

## Medium Priority Improvements
### 1. More detail on the related work (Medium priority)
There are two paragraphs that could be improved upon. The authors say that their method can be used in many other areas, but they do not give more details about the related work. It would be important to know if there is any relevant work for the specific datasets.

#### Why it matters:
The reader may want to compare the new method with some existing methods. If the number of epochs for training is fixed and it is different for different datasets, this could affect the performance of their method. The related work could have a great impact on the performance of their method. It is important to know if there are any relevant works that can be used in their specific scenario.

#### How to address it:
The authors can add some details about the related work in Section 1, and they should also provide more information about the parameter tuning process.
### 2. More detail on the experimental settings (Medium priority)
The authors do not give much information about the experimental design as they go along. It is important to know if the number of epochs for training is fixed and if it is different for different datasets.

#### Why it matters:
The reader may want to compare the new method with some existing methods. If the number of epochs for training is not fixed and it is different for different datasets, this could affect the performance of their method. The experimental design could have a great impact on the performance of their method.
#### How to address it:
The authors can add more details about the parameter tuning process in Section 2.1.

### 3. More detail on the results (Medium priority)
The authors do not give much information about the accuracy and other metrics for different methods. The reader may want to compare the new method with some existing methods.
#### Why it matters:
It is important to know if there are any relevant works that can be used in their specific scenario. If the number of epochs for training is fixed, this may affect the performance of their method. It is important to know if there are any relevant works that can be used in their specific scenario.

#### How to address it:
The authors should provide more information about the accuracy and other metrics for different methods.
### 4. More detail on the parameter tuning (Medium priority)
The authors tune a few hyperparameters, but they do not give much details about how to choose these parameters. They can add some tables or figures to show this information.

#### Why it matters:
Without enough information about the parameter tuning process, the reader may not know if there are other better choices of the parameters. The number of epochs for training is also important and should be reported in the paper.
#### How to address it:
The authors can add some tables or figures to show this information.

## Low Priority Improvements
### 1. More detail on the parameter tuning (Low priority)
There are a few places where the authors could provide more details about the parameter tuning process, such as the learning rate and the number of training epochs.

#### Why it matters:
The reader may want to compare the new method with some existing methods. The parameter tuning is important for the performance of their method. The number of epochs for training is also important and should be reported in the paper.
#### How to address it:
The authors can add more details about the parameter tuning process in Section 2.1.
