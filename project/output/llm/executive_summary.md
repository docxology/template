### Overview
This paper presents a novel, adaptive subgradient method for stochastic optimization that is able to achieve the same convergence rates as the state-of-the-art non-adaptive methods. The proposed algorithm is simple and easy to implement. It does not require any additional information about the problem or the data distribution beyond what is required by the standard stochastic gradient (SG) method, but it can be used in a wide variety of settings. In particular, it can be used for both convex and non-convex functions and with different types of noise. The algorithm is based on an adaptive learning rate that depends on the current iteration number and the value of the function at the previous iteration. This is different from the standard SG method which uses a constant learning rate. It also does not require any additional information about the problem or the data distribution beyond what is required by the standard SG method, but it can be used in a wide variety of settings. In particular, it can be used for both convex and non-convex functions and with different types of noise.
