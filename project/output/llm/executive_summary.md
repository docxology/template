### Overview

A new open-source, high-performance optimization algorithm is introduced that can be used for a wide range of machine learning problems. The authors provide a detailed description of their method and compare it to existing methods on several benchmarks.

### Key Contributions

The main contributions of the manuscript are the following:
- A novel algorithm for stochastic convex optimization.
- A new framework for analyzing the performance of an optimization algorithm, which is more comprehensive than previous ones in that it includes both convergence and scalability metrics. The authors show how this framework can be used to compare multiple methods on a single benchmark.

### Methodology Summary

The manuscript describes a new open-source optimization algorithm that can be used for a wide range of machine learning problems. The method is based on the stochastic average gradient (SAG) algorithm, which is an iterative algorithm for solving a sequence of convex minimization problems. The authors also describe a framework for analyzing the performance of an optimization algorithm, which includes both convergence and scalability metrics. The authors show how this framework can be used to compare multiple methods on a single benchmark.

### Principal Results

The principal results are the following:
- A new open-source optimization algorithm that is based on the SAG algorithm.
- An analysis of the performance of the SAG algorithm, which includes both convergence and scalability metrics. The authors show how this framework can be used to compare multiple methods on a single benchmark.

### Significance and Impact

The manuscript provides an important contribution in the area of optimization algorithms for machine learning. The new algorithm is based on the SAG algorithm that is widely used. The new analysis is also a significant contribution because it includes both convergence and scalability metrics, which are more comprehensive than previous ones in that they can be used to compare multiple methods on a single benchmark.
