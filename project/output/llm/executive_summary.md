### Overview

This paper presents a novel and efficient algorithm for the stochastic optimization of nonconvex functions, which is based on an adaptive gradient method. The proposed method can be used to minimize any convex or nonconvex function that has a Lipschitz continuous gradient. It is shown that under some mild conditions, the proposed method achieves a linear convergence rate in the sense of the objective value and a sublinear convergence rate for the gradient norm. In particular, it is proved that if the objective function is convex, then the proposed algorithm can achieve an optimal linear convergence rate. The analysis also shows that the proposed algorithm can achieve a faster convergence rate than the standard stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method in some cases. The paper also provides some numerical experiments to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.
