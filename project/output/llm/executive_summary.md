## Overview
The paper proposes a new optimization algorithm for stochastic gradient descent (SGD) that is able to achieve the optimal convergence rate in the nonconvex setting. The authors first prove that the standard SGD can not converge faster than O(1/k), and then propose an adaptive subgradient method that achieves the optimal O(1/k) rate. The proposed algorithm is simple, easy to implement, and has a good theoretical guarantee. It can be used for both convex and nonconvex problems. The authors also compare the performance of the standard SGD with the proposed algorithm on some benchmarks. The results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve the optimal O(1/k) rate in the nonconvex setting and is competitive to the state-of-the-art methods.
