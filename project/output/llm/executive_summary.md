### Overview

A new optimization algorithm is presented for large-scale machine learning, which is a critical problem in many fields of science and engineering. The proposed method is called "AdaGrad" (short for adaptive gradient) because it adapts the step sizes based on the magnitude of the gradients. In the past, the most widely used stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm has been to set the learning rate as a constant value. This is not very good in practice. The reason is that different data sets have different learning rates. For example, some data sets need large learning rates while others do not. So it is hard to choose a suitable constant learning rate for all the data sets. In this manuscript, the authors proposed an adaptive gradient algorithm which can adaptively change the step size based on the magnitude of the gradients. The new method is called "AdaGrad". The AdaGrad is a combination of the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and the exponential weight decay (EWD). The SCDG is used to update the parameters while the EWD is used to set the learning rate. The authors proved that the proposed algorithm can achieve better performance than the SGD in many experiments. The authors also compared the AdaGrad with other popular optimization algorithms such as Adam, RMSProp and Adagrad. In the experiments, the AdaGrad is better than all the others. This manuscript provides a comprehensive introduction of the new method.
