**Overview**

A new optimization algorithm, called "Adaptive Subgradient Methods for Online Learning and Stochastic Optimization," is introduced by Duchi, Hazan, and Singer (2011). This paper presents a general class of adaptive subgradient methods that can be used to solve both online learning and stochastic optimization problems. The authors provide an overview of the main algorithms in this class and their convergence properties. They also describe a number of variants of these algorithms and their relative advantages. The authors show how the algorithms can be applied to a variety of different problems, including linear regression, logistic regression, support vector machines, and neural networks. In particular, they present an adaptive version of the stochastic gradient descent algorithm that is guaranteed to converge for all convex functions.

**Key Contributions**

The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of a new class of algorithms called "adaptive subgradient methods." The authors show how these algorithms can be used to solve both online learning and stochastic optimization problems. They also describe the convergence properties of the adaptive subgradient algorithm, which they call "AdaGrad," and present an adaptive version of the stochastic gradient descent algorithm that is guaranteed to converge for all convex functions.

**Methodology Summary**

The authors begin by describing a number of different algorithms in this class. These include the AdaGrad algorithm, which has the best known convergence rate among the adaptive subgradient methods. They also describe the "AdaDelta" and "AdaDiag" variants of the AdaGrad algorithm, which are guaranteed to converge for all convex functions. The authors then present a number of different applications of these algorithms.

**Principal Results**

The principal results of this paper are the convergence properties of the adaptive subgradient methods. These are presented in Section 3. The main theorem is that the adaptive subgradient method is guaranteed to converge for all convex functions. This result is proved by showing that the AdaGrad algorithm has a good worst-case performance and that it can be used as an adaptive version of the stochastic gradient descent algorithm.
