### Overview

This paper presents a new, high-performance, open-source optimization library for large-scale machine learning. The library is called Optuna and it is designed to be easy to use with minimal learning curve. It can be used as a drop-in replacement for the popular Adam optimizer in many deep learning frameworks and libraries. The authors of this manuscript have implemented the new algorithm in the PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Julia programming languages. They compare its performance on 13 different problems, including both classification and regression tasks, with the Adam algorithm. In all cases, the new algorithm performs better than or as well as the Adam algorithm. It is also compared to a number of other optimization algorithms that are not based on Adam. The authors have implemented the new algorithm in the PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Julia programming languages.

### Key Contributions

The key contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows: 
1. A new optimization algorithm called "AdamW" is presented.
2. The performance of the new algorithm is compared to that of Adam on 13 different problems with a variety of sizes and complexities.
3. The authors have implemented the new algorithm in three popular deep learning frameworks, including PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Julia.

### Principal Results

The principal results are as follows: 
1. On all 13 problems, the performance of the "AdamW" algorithm is better than or at least as good as that of Adam.
2. The authors have implemented the new algorithm in three popular deep learning frameworks, including PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Julia.
