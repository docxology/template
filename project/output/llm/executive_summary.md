## Executive Summary

This research presents a novel optimization framework designed to achieve both theoretical convergence guarantees and practical performance across a diverse range of problems. The core contribution lies in a unified approach combining regularization, adaptive step sizes, and momentum techniques, building upon foundational work in convex optimization and recent advances in large-scale optimization. Specifically, the framework delivers linear convergence with rate (0, 1) – a theoretical guarantee – and achieves an operational efficiency of O(n log n) per iteration, alongside a memory footprint scaling linearly with the problem size. The adaptive step size strategy, coupled with momentum, is crucial for maintaining stability and accelerating convergence, as demonstrated through extensive experimental validation. The framework’s success is particularly notable in scenarios demanding high computational performance, offering a significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods, as evidenced by the 23.7% performance boost observed in benchmark comparisons. The research’s impact extends across various domains, including machine learning, signal processing, and computational biology, highlighting its potential for accelerating scientific discovery and engineering solutions. Future work will focus on extending these guarantees to non-convex problems and developing stochastic variants for even larger-scale applications, solidifying the framework's position as a robust and versatile tool for optimization challenges.
