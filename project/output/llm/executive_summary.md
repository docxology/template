## Executive Summary

This research presents a novel optimization framework designed to achieve both theoretical convergence guarantees and practical performance across diverse problems. The core contribution lies in a unified approach combining regularization, adaptive step sizes, and momentum techniques, building upon foundational work in convex optimization and recent advances in large-scale optimization. Specifically, the framework solves optimization problems of the form f(x) = n
i=1 wii(x) + R(x) using an iterative update rule with adaptive step sizes and momentum terms, as detailed in Section 3.1. The experimental evaluation, as presented in Section 4, demonstrates empirical convergence constants C 1.2 and 0.85 matching theoretical predictions, linear memory scaling enabling large-scale problem solving, and 94.3% success rate across diverse problem instances.  The framework’s scalability, as highlighted in Section 3.5, is particularly noteworthy, offering a solution that addresses the limitations of existing methods.  The framework’s ability to achieve both theoretical guarantees and practical performance makes it a significant advancement in the field of optimization, as demonstrated in Section 4.3.1.
