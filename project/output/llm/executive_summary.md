### Overview

This paper proposes a new optimization algorithm for training machine learning models, which is called AdamW. It is an adaptive stochastic gradient descent method that uses the first-order information of the objective function to update the model parameters. The main contribution of this work is that it can be used in various scenarios such as online learning and stochastic optimization. The proposed AdamW is a simple but powerful algorithm for training machine learning models, which has been widely applied in many real-world applications. It is based on the idea of adaptive subgradient methods. The first-order information of the objective function is obtained by the gradient of the loss function.
