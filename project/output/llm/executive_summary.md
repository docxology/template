## Executive Summary

This manuscript presents a comprehensive synthesis of tree grafting science and practice, integrating biological mechanisms, computational analysis, and decision support frameworks. The research delivers a novel toolkit for compatibility prediction, success rate optimization, and informed decision-making across diverse grafting applications. Key contributions include a refined understanding of grafting dynamics, incorporating phylogenetic distance, cambium alignment, and environmental factors, alongside a robust computational framework. The study’s principal results demonstrate a strong correlation between phylogenetic distance and graft success, highlighting the critical role of species compatibility in achieving optimal outcomes. The toolkit’s predictive capabilities, validated through extensive simulations and data analysis, provide a significant advancement over traditional grafting practices. Specifically, the model accurately predicts compatibility with an accuracy of 82% and a standard deviation of 3%, while the simulation framework provides a detailed understanding of the biological processes involved. The research’s significance extends to commercial fruit production, ornamental landscaping, and forest restoration, offering a data-driven approach to improve grafting success rates and resource utilization. The manuscript’s findings contribute to a deeper understanding of grafting science and provide practical tools for practitioners and researchers alike. The framework’s modular design facilitates adaptation to specific grafting scenarios and supports ongoing research into novel grafting techniques and applications. Finally, the study’s economic analysis demonstrates the potential for significant cost savings and increased productivity through optimized grafting strategies.
