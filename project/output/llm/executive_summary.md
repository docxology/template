Overview

This paper is a foundational work that provides an alternative to the traditional free energy principle (FEP) of active inference, which has been widely used for modeling brain function and other complex systems. The authors argue that the FEP is not a fundamental theory but rather a derived consequence from a more general framework, namely the boundary logic of the universe. They propose that the FEP should be replaced by the "containment" theory, which is based on the idea that the universe has boundaries that are not fixed or determinate and instead depend on the observer's perspective. The authors show how this new theory can explain a wide range of phenomena in physics, biology, philosophy, and cognitive science. The paper is an important contribution to the understanding of the nature of the universe and its principles.

Key Contributions

The main contributions of the manuscript are the development of the "containment" theory as an alternative to the FEP. The authors also show how this new theory can explain a wide range of phenomena in physics, biology, philosophy, and cognitive science.

Methodology Summary

The methodology is based on the idea that the universe has boundaries that are not fixed or determinate and instead depend on the observer's perspective. The authors argue that the FEP should be replaced by the "containment" theory. They show how this new theory can explain a wide range of phenomena in physics, biology, philosophy, and cognitive science.

Principal Results

The principal results of the manuscript are that the FEP is not a fundamental theory but rather a derived consequence from the more general framework of the "containment" theory. The authors also show how this new theory can explain a wide range of phenomena in physics, biology, philosophy, and cognitive science.

Significance and Impact

The significance and impact of the manuscript are that it provides an alternative to the FEP. This is important because the FEP has been widely used for modeling brain function and other complex systems. The authors also show how this new theory can explain a wide range of phenomena in physics, biology, philosophy, and cognitive science.

### Overview

The universe is thought to be governed by laws that are fundamental and universal. This paper argues that the free energy principle (FEP) is not one such law but rather a derived consequence from a more general framework. The authors propose an alternative theory of "containment" which they argue should replace the FEP. They show how this new theory can explain a wide range of phenomena in physics, biology, philosophy, and cognitive science.
