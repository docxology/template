## Executive Summary

This research presents a novel optimization framework designed to achieve both theoretical convergence guarantees and practical performance across a diverse range of problems. The framework combines adaptive step sizes, momentum, and a carefully structured mathematical framework, building upon foundational work in convex optimization and recent advances in large-scale optimization. Key contributions include a unified approach, proven linear convergence with rate (0, 1), and an O(n log n) per-iteration complexity, enabling efficient solution of problems with large dimensions. The framework’s experimental validation demonstrates its ability to match theoretical predictions, achieving a 94.3% success rate across benchmark datasets. This work represents a significant advancement in optimization theory and practice, offering a robust and scalable solution for researchers and practitioners. Future research will extend the theoretical guarantees to non-convex problems and explore multi-objective optimization scenarios.

The core of the framework lies in its adaptive step size strategy, which dynamically adjusts the learning rate based on gradient history, effectively mitigating the challenges associated with varying gradient magnitudes. This approach, coupled with the momentum term, ensures stable convergence and accelerates the optimization process. The framework’s scalability, demonstrated by its linear memory scaling, makes it suitable for large-scale problems, a critical factor in many modern applications. The experimental results, detailed in Section 4, showcase the framework’s ability to outperform state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks, confirming its theoretical predictions and highlighting its practical value. The framework’s impact extends beyond its technical contributions, offering a scalable and robust solution for a wide range of optimization problems, including machine learning, signal processing, and climate modeling. The combination of theoretical rigor and experimental validation establishes this work as a significant contribution to the field of optimization. Further research will focus on expanding the applicability of this framework to more complex and challenging problems.
