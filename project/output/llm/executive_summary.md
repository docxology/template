**Overview**

This paper presents a novel, fully automated method for generating synthetic datasets that mimic real-world data in terms of statistical and visual properties, which can be used to test and compare various algorithms. The authors introduce a simple-to-use interface for the generation of datasets with controlled characteristics. This is achieved by using a combination of three components: the Data Generator, the Data Processor, and the Validation Framework. These tools are designed to work together seamlessly, providing a comprehensive solution for data quality control and algorithm evaluation. The Data Generator provides a wide range of options for generating synthetic datasets that mimic real-world data in terms of statistical properties (e.g., mean, median, mode, standard deviation) and visual properties (e.g., skewness, kurtosis). The Data Processor enables the user to clean the data by removing or ﬁlling invalid values. It also provides a range of options for validating the quality of the data. These include an outlier detection function that can be used to detect any anomalies in the data and a standardization function that can be used to ensure the data is zero-mean and unit-variance. The Validation Framework enables the user to create a validation pipeline, which can be used for testing the accuracy of the data processing. A range of options are available to compare the performance of different algorithms on benchmarks. This includes a measure of speedup relative to baseline, resource utilization, and statistical signiﬁcance tests.
