Title: Ways of Figuring Things Out: A Systematic Analysis of a Framework for Characterizing and Analyzing Knowledge Systems

Abstract:

The House of Knowledge (HoK) is a framework that has been used in various disciplines to represent the relationships among different types of knowledge. The ways of figuring things out that are represented in the HoK can be characterized by their characteristics, which include the way they are used, the context in which they are used, and the way they relate to one another. This paper presents a system for characterizing and analyzing these ways of figuring things out. The framework is based on an analysis of 24 philosophical questions that were posed in the House of Knowledge. The ways of figuring things out can be characterized by their characteristics, which include the way they are used, the context in which they are used, and the way they relate to one another. This paper presents a system for characterizing and analyzing these ways of figuring things out. The framework is based on an analysis of 24 philosophical questions that were posed in the House of Knowledge. The ways of figuring things out can be characterized by their characteristics, which include the way they are used, the context in which they are used, and the way they relate to one another.
