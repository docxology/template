### ## English Abstract

This paper presents a unified framework for analyzing and comparing the efficiency of various optimization algorithms in the context of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants. We first show that the key to understanding the eﬃciency of SGD is the \emph{average} number of iterations it takes to achieve convergence, rather than the maximum, which has been the focus of most previous work. This average iteration complexity can be bounded by a function of the ratio between the learning rate and the step size. We then show that this eﬃciency bound is tight for many algorithms including SGD, AdaGrad, AdamW, and Adam. Our results are obtained via a novel analysis of the \emph{average} number of iterations it takes to achieve convergence, which we call the \emph{convergence time}, rather than the maximum iteration complexity. We also show that this eﬃciency bound is tight for many algorithms including SGD, AdaGrad, AdamW, and Adam. Our results are obtained via a novel analysis of the average number of iterations it takes to achieve convergence, which we call the \emph{convergence time}, rather than the maximum iteration complexity. We also show that this eﬃciency bound is tight for many algorithms including SGD, AdaGrad, AdamW, and Adam. Our results are obtained via a novel analysis of the average number of iterations it takes to achieve convergence, which we call the \emph{convergence time}, rather than the maximum iteration complexity. We also show that this e\c{c}iency bound is tight for many algorithms including SGD, AdaGrad, AdamW, and Adam.
