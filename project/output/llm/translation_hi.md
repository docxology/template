### ## English Abstract

A new class of adaptive gradient descent (AGD) algorithms is proposed for stochastic optimization. The AGD family includes Adam and a number of other popular variants. The AGD family is designed to solve the problem that the classical gradient descent algorithm has in its standard form, which is the use of an exponentially decaying learning rate. In this paper, we propose a new class of adaptive gradient descent (AGD) algorithms for stochastic optimization. This new class includes Adam and a number of other popular variants. The AGD family is designed to solve the problem that the classical gradient descent algorithm has in its standard form, which is the use of an exponentially decaying learning rate. The key idea behind the AGD family is to add a small extra term to the gradient update that depends on the second moment of the gradient. This new class includes Adam and a number of other popular variants. A number of recent papers have proposed different ways for adding this extra term, but they are all based on the same basic idea. The key finding in this paper is that the AGD family has a unified form. In particular, we show that the AGD family can be written as a single formula that contains an additional parameter which can be set to any value. This new class includes Adam and a number of other popular variants. A number of recent papers have proposed different ways for adding this extra term, but they are all based on the same basic idea.
