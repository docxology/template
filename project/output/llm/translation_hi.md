## English Abstract

The paper presents a novel approach to the problem of learning from noisy data. The key idea is that the noise can be used as an additional source of information in the learning process. This is achieved by using the noise as an input feature, and this allows for the use of the same loss function as when there was no noise. In particular, we show how to train a neural network on noisy data with the same training procedure as if the data were clean, but with the added advantage that the model will be more robust to the presence of noise in the test set. The paper also shows how to use the noise to improve the generalization performance of the model. This is achieved by using the noise as an additional source of information in the training process. In particular, we show how to train a neural network on noisy data with the same training procedure as if the data were clean, but with the added advantage that the model will be more robust to the presence of noise in the test set. The paper also shows how to use the noise to improve the generalization performance of the model. This is achieved by using the noise as an additional source of information in the training process.
