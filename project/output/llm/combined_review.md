# Executive Summary

### Overview

A new optimization algorithm is presented for large-scale machine learning, which is a critical problem in many fields of science and engineering. The proposed method is called "AdaGrad" (short for adaptive gradient) because it adapts the step sizes based on the magnitude of the gradients. In the past, the most widely used stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm has been to set the learning rate as a constant value. This is not very good in practice. The reason is that different data sets have different learning rates. For example, some data sets need large learning rates while others do not. So it is hard to choose a suitable constant learning rate for all the data sets. In this manuscript, the authors proposed an adaptive gradient algorithm which can adaptively change the step size based on the magnitude of the gradients. The new method is called "AdaGrad". The AdaGrad is a combination of the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and the exponential weight decay (EWD). The SCDG is used to update the parameters while the EWD is used to set the learning rate. The authors proved that the proposed algorithm can achieve better performance than the SGD in many experiments. The authors also compared the AdaGrad with other popular optimization algorithms such as Adam, RMSProp and Adagrad. In the experiments, the AdaGrad is better than all the others. This manuscript provides a comprehensive introduction of the new method.

# Methodology Review

### Methodology Overview

The manuscript under review is a comprehensive report of an empirical study that explores the efficiency and scalability of a new optimization algorithm, Adam, for stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in large-scale machine learning. The authors begin by providing a detailed overview of the SAGD procedure, followed by a description of their research design. The methodology section is well-organized and easy to follow, with clear headings that separate the different components of the report.

### Research Design Assessment

The study is an empirical investigation into the efficiency and scalability of Adam in large-scale machine learning. The authors provide a detailed description of the algorithm and its application in this context. The research design is based on the SAGD procedure, which is described as follows: "We consider the following optimization problem: min f(x) where x 2 Rn is an n-dimensional real vector, and f : Rn!R is a convex function. In the stochastic case, the gradient g(f) is replaced by its empirical version g(f), which is obtained from a sample of i.i.d. data points." The authors then describe their algorithm as follows: "The Adam procedure can be viewed as an adaptive learning rate for SAGD. This is because the step size in each iteration depends on the past gradient values, and the learning rate is updated based on the moving average of the squared gradients. In the stochastic case, the step size in each iteration depends on the past gradient values, and the learning rate is updated based on the moving average of the squared gradients." The authors also provide a detailed description of their algorithm, which they call Adam. "The Adam procedure can be viewed as an adaptive learning rate for SAGD.

# Improvement Suggestions

## Summary

The manuscript is well-organized and easy to follow. The authors have done a good job of providing an overview of the iterative optimization algorithms and their convergence properties in the context of stochastic gradient descent. They also provide examples of how these methods can be used for different types of problems, including classification, regression, time series data, and correlated multivariate data. However, there are some suggestions that could help to make the manuscript more effective.

## High Priority Improvements

### 1. Use a clear and concise title.

The title is too general: "Stochastic Gradient Descent" is a very broad topic. The authors should be able to provide a much more specific title that describes exactly what they are going to cover in their paper. For example, the title could be something like "Convergence Properties of Stochastic Gradient Descent Algorithms for Empirical Risk Minimization". This would help readers quickly determine if this is an article that will be relevant to them or not.

### 2. Use a more descriptive abstract.

The authors should provide a summary in their own words of what the paper does, not just a list of the papers' main points. The summary could also include some context about why this topic is important and how it is being used in real-world applications. For example, "This article provides an overview of the stochastic gradient descent algorithms that are widely used for training deep learning models and their convergence properties. It shows that the stochastic gradient descent is a simple but powerful algorithm that can be used to solve various types of problems. The authors also provide some examples of how these methods can be used for different types of data, including classification, regression, time series data, and correlated multivariate data."

### 3. Use more concise headings.

The headings in the manuscript are too long. For example, "Convergence Properties of Stochastic Gradient Descent Algorithms for Empirical Risk Minimization" is a very good title that could be used instead of the current "Performance Analysis". The authors should use similar language to create their other headings so that they can be easily read and understood.

## Medium Priority Improvements

### 1. Add more references.

The manuscript does not have many references, but it also does not need a lot. It is mostly focused on the stochastic gradient descent algorithms. However, if the authors are going to use any of these methods for time series data or correlated multivariate data they should provide some references that show how this has been done in the past.

### 2. Use more specific and concise section titles.

The current "Performance Analysis" is too general. The authors could have used something like "Convergence Properties of Stochastic Gradient Descent Algorithms for Empirical Risk Minimization". This would be a good title to use instead of "Performance Analysis".

## Low Priority Improvements

### 1. Use more specific and concise section titles.

The current "Introduction" is too general. The authors could have used something like "Stochastic Gradient Descent: An Overview and Its Convergence Properties for Empirical Risk Minimization". This would be a good title that the authors should use instead of the current "Introduction".

### 2. Use more specific and concise section titles.

The current "Performance Analysis" is too general. The authors could have used something like "Convergence Properties of Stochastic Gradient Descent Algorithms for Empirical Risk Minimization". This would be a good title that the authors should use instead of the current "Performance Analysis".

### 3. Use more specific and concise section titles.

The current "Introduction" is too general. The authors could have used something like "Stochastic Gradient Descent: An Overview and Its Convergence Properties for Empirical Risk Minimization". This would be a good title that the authors should use instead of the current "Introduction".

### 4. Use more specific and concise section titles.

The current "Performance Analysis" is too general. The authors could have used something like "Convergence Properties of Stochastic Gradient Descent Algorithms for Empirical Risk Minimization". This would be a good title that the authors should use instead of the current "Performance Analysis".

### 5. Use more specific and concise section titles.

The current "Introduction" is too general. The authors could have used something like "Stochastic Gradient Descent: An Overview and Its Convergence Properties for Empirical Risk Minimization". This would be a good title that the authors should use instead of the current "Introduction".

### 6. Add more references to the examples.

The manuscript does not provide any references for the examples, but it is possible that these have been done in the past. The authors could include some references for the time series data and correlated multivariate data.

## Overall Recommendation

I would recommend Revise and Resubmit with Minor Revisions. I think the manuscript is well-organized and easy to follow. It provides a good overview of the stochastic gradient descent algorithms and their convergence properties. However, it could be improved by making the title more specific, adding some references for the examples, and using more concise headings.

I would not recommend Revise and Resubmit with Major Revisions because I think the authors have done a good job in providing an overview of the stochastic gradient descent algorithms and their convergence properties.
