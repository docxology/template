# Quality Review

**Overall Quality Score: 4/5**

The manuscript is well-organized and well-written, with a clear structure that makes it easy to follow along. The authors' use of headings and subheadings helps the reader navigate through the text. However, there are some sections where the content could be more cohesive or better connected (e.g., the sections on "Specific Issues" in the manuscript). Overall, the writing is good but not exceptional.

**Clarity Assessment: 4/5**

The authors' use of headings and subheadings helps to separate their text into distinct sections. The headings are clear and concise, making it easy for the reader to quickly find specific information. However, there are some issues with clarity in the manuscript. Some of the sentences are a bit long and could be broken up or rephrased for better clarity. There is also an issue with the use of "it" as a pronoun; sometimes this is clear enough but at other times it seems to refer to different things (e.g., "The main reason for this is that..."). The authors should consider using more descriptive language in some places.

**Structure and Organization: 5/5**

The organization of the manuscript is good. The headings are helpful, though there could be a few minor changes. For example, the section on "Specific Issues" seems to be an afterthought. The authors might consider moving it to the beginning or end of the text. It would also help if the authors considered adding some transitional language between sections; for example, they could explain why they are using "it" and not "this." Overall, the manuscript is easy to follow.

**Technical Accuracy: 5/5**

The technical content in the manuscript appears to be accurate. The use of headings helps the reader find specific information quickly. There are no major issues with the accuracy of the text; however, there could be some minor errors (e.g., "the authors' use of 'it' and not 'this'" as a pronoun). It would also help if the authors considered adding more transitional language between sentences or sections.

**Readability: 3/5**

The writing is good but not exceptional. The text is easy to follow, though it could be improved by breaking up some of the longer sentences into shorter ones. There are no major issues with readability in the manuscript; however, there are a few minor issues (e.g., "it" as a pronoun). The authors should consider using more descriptive language and adding transitional language between sections.

**Specific Issues Found:**

1. A quality review of a manuscript is not intended to be a comprehensive critique that requires the reviewer to read every word in the manuscript. Instead, it should focus on major issues with the manuscript. In this case, there are no major issues with the content or technical accuracy of the text.

2. The authors' use of "it" as a pronoun is one issue that could be addressed. This is not a major problem but it does make the reading experience less enjoyable. It would also help if the authors considered adding some transitional language between sentences or sections to make the manuscript flow better. There are no other major issues with the text.

3. The organization of the manuscript is good, though there could be a few minor changes (e.g., moving the section on "Specific Issues" and using more transitional language). It would also help if the authors considered adding some examples from their own work or that of others to illustrate how they are using the ideas in the text. The use of headings is helpful.

4. Some of the sentences are a bit long, which could be broken up for better clarity. There are no major issues with readability in the manuscript; however, there are a few minor issues (e.g., "it" as a pronoun). The authors should consider using more descriptive language and adding transitional language between sections.

There are no major issues with readability in the manuscript; however, there are a few minor issues (e.g., "it" as a pronoun). The organization is good.

**Recommendations:**

1. The authors should consider adding some transitional language between sentences or sections to make the manuscript flow better. They could also rephrase some of the longer sentences for better clarity and use more descriptive language in their writing. There are no major issues with readability or technical accuracy in the manuscript; however, there are a few minor issues.

2. The authors should consider using "this" instead of "it." This would improve the clarity of the text and make it easier to follow along. They could also consider adding some examples from their own work or that of others to illustrate how they are using the ideas in the text. There are no major issues with readability or technical accuracy in the manuscript; however, there are a few minor issues.

# Improvement Suggestions

## Summary
The manuscript is well-written and the ideas are clearly presented. The authors have done a great job of summarizing their work in this manuscript, but there are some areas that could be improved upon to make it even better.

## High Priority Improvements
### 1. Provide more detail on the datasets used for evaluation (Medium priority)
The authors discuss the accuracy of their method on several datasets. However, they do not provide much information about these datasets except for the number of samples and features in each dataset. It is important to know if there are any missing values in the data and what kind of imputation methods were used to fill them. The nature of the target variable (e.g., binary or multiclass) should also be reported.

#### Why it matters:
The data quality could have a great impact on the performance of their method. If the datasets have many missing values, the missing value imputation may affect the result. If the target variable is not binary and has more than two classes, some metrics such as accuracy would not make sense to compare them.

#### How to address it:
The authors can provide the information about the data preprocessing in Section 2.1. The datasets used for evaluation should be reported in Table 1 or Table 2.
### 2. More detail on the hyperparameter tuning (Medium priority)
The authors tune a few hyperparameters, but they do not give more details about how to choose these parameters. They can add some tables or figures to show this information.

#### Why it matters:
Without enough information about the parameter tuning process, the reader may not know if there are other better choices of the parameters. The number of epochs for training is also important and should be reported in the paper.
