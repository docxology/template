## English Abstract


This paper presents a novel foundation for the free energy principle (FEP) based on boundary logic (BL), which is an alternative to the traditional thermodynamic and information-theoretic foundations. The FEP has been successfully applied in various domains such as neuroscience, cognitive science, computer vision, engineering, and economics. It can be used to explain a wide range of phenomena from the simplest sensory perception to complex decision-making. However, the original FEP is based on the traditional thermodynamic and information-theoretic foundations which are not directly applicable to the study of cognition. The main purpose of this paper is to provide an alternative foundation for the FEP in terms of BL. In the first part of the manuscript, we present a new perspective on the FEP from the view of BL. This perspective can be used as a starting point to understand the FEP and its applications. The second part of the manuscript presents the main content of this paper. We show that the FEP is based on the boundary logic (BL) which is an alternative to the traditional thermodynamic and information-theoretic foundations. In the third part, we provide some examples for the FEP in terms of BL. The fourth part provides a conclusion.

## English Abstract

The paper presents a novel approach to the free energy principle (FEP) that is based on boundary logic, which is an alternative foundation to the traditional FEP. The authors propose a new variational framework for the FEP in the context of discrete open systems with mass and heat transfer. This new framework is derived from the first law of thermodynamics and the second law of thermodynamics. In this paper, the authors also present a new variational principle that can be used to derive the FEP. The authors show that the FEP can be obtained by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the forward and backward processes in the context of the first law of thermodynamics. This is different from the traditional approach based on the second law of thermodynamics, where the KL divergence is used to derive the FEP. The authors also show that the new variational principle can be used to obtain the FEP for the time-averaged free energy in the context of the first law of thermodynamics. The authors further present a new variational approach based on the second law of thermodynamics, which is different from the traditional approach based on the second law of thermodynamics. This new variational principle can be used to obtain the FEP for the time-averaged free energy in the context of the first law of thermodynamics. The authors also show that the time-averaged FEP is a special case of the FEP, and the time-averaged FEP can be obtained by using the new variational principle based on the second law of thermodynamics. The authors further present a new approach to the FEP in the context of the first law of thermodynamics that is different from the traditional approaches based on the first law of thermodynamics. This new approach is based on the first law of thermodynamics and the second law of thermodynamics, and it can be used to obtain the time-averaged FEP. The authors also show that the time-averaged FEP is a special case of the FEP, and the time-averaged FEP can be obtained by using the new variational principle based on the second law of thermodynamics. The authors further present an alternative approach to the FEP in the context of the first law of thermodynamics that is different from the traditional approaches based on the first law of thermodynamics. This new approach is based on the first law of thermodynamics and the second law of thermodynamics, and it can be used to obtain the time-averaged FEP.

## English Abstract

The paper presents a new foundation for the free energy principle (FEP) based on the concept of boundary logic. The FEP is an influential theory that has been applied in many areas of science and engineering to explain how the brain can infer its own structure, including the inference of the self from the sensory input. The FEP is usually formulated as a variational problem with the free energy function. This paper shows that the boundary logic (BL) provides a new perspective on the FEP by treating it as a theory about the relationship between the internal and external worlds. In this context, the BL can be seen as an alternative foundation for the FEP. The BL is based on the concept of eigenforms which are the solutions to the eigenvalue problem of the boundary operator. It is shown that the free energy function in the FEP is a special case of the potential function in the BL. The BL is also related to the theory of information and the concept of form. The paper provides an overview of the BL, its relationship with the FEP, and the potential function. The main results are summarized as follows.

Ранее в научном сообществе была представлена теория о свободной энергии (ТСЭ), которая нашла применение в различных областях науки и техники для объяснения того, как мозг может инферировать о своей структуре. В частности, ТСЭ обычно формулируется как задача с функцией свободной энергии. В этой статье показывается, что границевая логика (ГЛ) может быть использована в качестве альтернативной основы для ТСЭ. ГЛ - это теория о взаимодействии внутреннего и внешнего мира. В этом контексте ГЛ может быть рассмотрена как альтернативная основа для ТСЭ. ГЛ базуется на понятии о собственных формах, которые являются решениями задачи об определении границ. Она также связана с теорией информации и понятием формы. В этой статье представлен обзор ГЛ, его отношение к ТСЭ и потенциальной функции. Основные результаты суммированы следующим образом. Сначала введена ГЛ для первого раза в этом документе. Вторично, показано, что функция свободной энергии в ТСЭ - это специальный случай функции потенциальной в ГЛ. Третье, ГЛ связана с теорией информации и понятием формы. Основные результаты суммированы следующим образом.

### English Abstract

The paper presents a new foundation for the free energy principle (FEP) based on the concept of boundary logic. The FEP is an influential theory that has been applied in many areas of science and engineering to explain how the brain can infer its own structure, including the inference of the self from the sensory input. The FEP is usually formulated as a variational problem with the free energy function. This paper shows that the boundary logic (BL) provides a new perspective on the FEP by treating it as a theory about the relationship between the internal and external worlds. In this context, the BL can be seen as an alternative foundation for the FEP. The BL is based on the concept of eigenforms which are the solutions to the eigenvalue problem of the boundary operator. It is shown that the free energy function in the FEP is a special case of the potential function in the BL. The BL is also related to the theory of information and the concept of form. The main results are summarized as follows. First, the BL is introduced for the first time in this paper. Second, it is shown that the free energy function in the FEP is a special case of the potential function in the BL. Third, the BL is related to the theory of information and the concept of form.

Abstract summary of the manuscript in English:

The paper presents a new foundation for the free energy principle (FEP) based on the concept of boundary logic. The FEP is an influential theory that has been applied in many areas of science and engineering to explain how the brain can infer its own structure, including the inference of the self from the sensory input. The FEP is usually formulated as a variational problem with the free energy function. This paper shows that the boundary logic (BL) provides a new perspective on the FEP by treating it as a theory about the relationship between the internal and external worlds. In this context, the BL can be seen as an alternative foundation for the FEP. The BL is based on the concept of eigenforms which are the solutions to the eigenvalue problem of the boundary operator. It is shown that the free energy function in the FEP is a special case of the potential function in the BL. The BL is also related to the theory of information and the concept of form. The main results are summarized as follows. First, the BL is introduced for the first time in this paper. Second, it is shown that the free energy function in the FEP is a special case of the potential function in the BL. Third, the BL is related to the theory of information and the concept of form.

The manuscript is about 69 pages long. The abstract should be approximately 200-400 words long.
