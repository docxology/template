# Executive Summary

### Overview

The manuscript "Ways of Figuring Things Out" is a comprehensive and systematic analysis of the ways that people figure things out, which are referred to as "ways." The authors' central argument is that there is more than one way in which we can think about how we figure things out. This perspective is based on the idea that there are different types of knowledge and different types of thinking. They propose a framework for characterizing the ways that people figure things out, which they call "ways."

# Quality Review

## Overall Quality Score
**Score: 4/5**

The manuscript is well-organized and easy to follow, with a clear introduction that sets the stage for the rest of the paper. The authors provide a helpful overview of their data collection process, which is also described in detail elsewhere (e.g., in the database section). The analysis of the ways data are presented is thorough and generally well done, although some of the statistical analyses could be improved upon. The manuscript would benefit from a more detailed discussion of the implications of the results.

## Clarity Assessment
**Score: 5/5**

The writing is clear and concise with no ambiguity in the meaning of the text. The authors provide enough information to understand their data collection process, but they do not explain it too much. They also present their analysis of the ways data in a way that is easy to follow. This is particularly true for the statistical analyses, which are presented in a clear and concise manner.

## Structure and Organization
**Score: 4/5**

The manuscript has an introduction that provides context for the rest of the paper. The authors then present their analysis of the ways data in a way that is easy to follow. This includes a section on the House of Knowledge, which is helpful because it is not immediately apparent from the title how this relates to the rest of the paper. The manuscript could be improved upon by providing more detail about the implications of the results.

## Technical Accuracy
**Score: 4/5**

The technical accuracy of the manuscript is generally good. However, there are a few issues that need to be addressed. First, it would have been helpful if the authors had provided an overview of the ways data in their analysis, which could have been done in the introduction or as part of the discussion section. The statistical analyses presented in this paper are not particularly complex and are well within the range of what a graduate student should know. However, there is no explanation for why these particular statistics were chosen. Second, it would be helpful if the authors had provided more detail about how they calculated their statistical measures (e.g., effect size). Third, the manuscript could have been improved upon by providing an overview of the ways data in their analysis, which could have been done in the introduction or as part of the discussion section.

## Readability
**Score: 4/5**

# Methodology Review

### Methodology Overview

The manuscript, "Ways of Figuring Things Out: A System for Characterizing and Analyzing Ways of Figuring Things Out," is a comprehensive system for characterizing and analyzing ways of figuring things out. The authors present a novel approach to understanding the complex nature of human cognition that is grounded in the philosophical framework of John Dewey's (1916) theory of inquiry, which posits that there are multiple ways of knowing and valuing knowledge. This paper presents a system for characterizing and analyzing these different ways of figuring things out. The authors' methodology is to develop a comprehensive system for understanding how people figure things out in order to better understand the nature of human cognition. The authors' approach is based on Dewey's (1916) theory that there are multiple ways of knowing and valuing knowledge, which they call "ways." This paper presents a novel approach to understanding the complex nature of human cognition that is grounded in the philosophical framework of John Dewey's (1916) theory of inquiry. The authors' methodology is to develop a comprehensive system for understanding how people figure things out in order to better understand the nature of human cognition.

### Research Design Assessment

The manuscript does not present an explicit research design, but it does describe the steps that were taken to collect and organize data from 2010-2011. The authors do not provide information about the sample size or demographic characteristics of the participants who provided data for this study. It is unclear if the data was collected via a survey or interview format. The manuscript presents a list of ways of figuring things out that were gathered by Andrius Kulikauskas, but it does not describe how these data were analyzed. The authors do not provide information about the reliability and validity of the measures used in this study.

# Improvement Suggestions

## Summary

The goal of this manuscript is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the House of Knowledge (HoK) framework, which consists of 24 categories that are organized in a two-dimensional matrix. The authors' purpose is to "explore the nature and implications of the House of Knowledge" as well as "to describe the structure of the House of Knowledge." The manuscript includes an overview of the HoK, and then it provides a ways-of-figuring-things-out (WFO) approach that is a systematic method for characterizing and analyzing the 24 categories. The authors also present the results from their analysis of the WFO data. 

## High Priority Improvements

### Content Relevance
The manuscript does not provide an overall summary of its main findings, which are a set of 3D plots (Figures 1-4) that illustrate the relationships between the ways-of-figuring-things-out and the characteristics of the categories in the House of Knowledge. These 3D plots are the central results of the manuscript. The authors state that "The results from these analyses will be discussed in this paper." However, there is no discussion about these findings after presenting the figures. This makes it difficult for readers to understand what the main results are and what they mean. It would be beneficial if the authors could provide a brief summary of their findings as well as an explanation of how the 3D plots were created. The main points that readers should take away from this manuscript are the patterns in these 3D plots that illustrate the relationships between the WFO and the characteristics of the categories in the HoK, but there is no way for them to do this without a summary of the findings. 

### Figure Legends
The manuscript does not provide any figure legends. The authors could have included a brief description of each figure that provides context about what the reader should look at when looking at the 3D plots. This would be helpful for readers who are unfamiliar with the topic, but even for those familiar with the topic it is important to know which category is being plotted in each dimension (Figures 1-4). It could also help if there were more details about what these relationships mean and how they were created. 

### References
The manuscript only includes a list of references that are not related to the content in the manuscript. The authors could have included more relevant references to support their arguments, but it would be beneficial for them to provide an explanation as well as additional citations from other areas of study. 

## Medium Priority Improvements

### WFO Data
The manuscript does not include any information about how the data was collected (e.g., what type of questionnaire or interview was used and who the respondents were), which is important because it may impact on the reliability and generalizability of the results. The authors could provide more details about their data collection methods, as well as how they are going to ensure that these respondents are representative of the larger population. 

### Ways of Figuring Things Out
The manuscript does not describe what the WFO is. The authors only state that it "is a systematic method for characterizing and analyzing the 24 categories." It would be beneficial if the authors could provide more details about how the WWO was developed, why this approach matters, and how the analysis was done. 

### Ways of Figuring Things Out (WFO) Analysis
The manuscript does not describe what characteristics were used to characterize each category in the HoK. The main results from these analyses are the 3D plots that illustrate the relationships between the WFO and the categories in the HoK, but there is no summary of the findings. This makes it difficult for readers to understand what the main results are and what they mean.

### Ways (Ways) Analysis
The manuscript does not state how the ways were analyzed. The authors could have described the steps that were used for this analysis. 

## Low Priority Improvements

### Overall Recommendation
This manuscript has a high level of difficulty, which is due to the fact that it uses too many abstract terms. For example, "ways-of-figuring-things-out" and "characterization-and-statistical-analysis." The authors should have avoided using these abstract terms by providing more concrete descriptions in the text. 

## Overall Recommendation

The overall recommendation for this manuscript is Revise and Resubmit. This manuscript has a lot of potential because it provides new ways to understand the House of Knowledge, but the readers will not know what the main findings are without a summary of the data. The authors should provide an explanation that how these 3D plots were created as well as more details about the results from these analyses. 

### Addressing the High Priority Improvements
The high priority improvements for this manuscript are to add a summary of the findings, include figure legends and describe the WFO analysis in detail. The authors should also consider how they can make the content easier to understand by providing more concrete descriptions in the text. In addition, if the data was collected from a questionnaire or interview, it would be beneficial if the authors could provide more details about their respondents as well as the reliability and generalizability of the results. 

## Addressing the Medium Priority Improvements
It is necessary to provide an explanation that how these 3D plots were created as well as what the main findings are. The authors should also consider using more concrete language in the text instead of abstract terms. It would be beneficial if the authors could describe their steps for the WWO analysis, and then they can explain the results from this analysis. 

## Addressing the Low Priority Improvements
There is no need to change the title or the content of this manuscript because it provides a new way to understand the House of Knowledge. The only thing that needs improvement is the presentation style. The authors should have provided more information about how these 3D plots were created and what the main findings are. 

## Addressing the Medium Priority Improvements
The medium priority improvements for this manuscript are to provide an explanation as well as describe the WWO analysis in detail, and then they could have used more concrete language instead of abstract terms.

The manuscript does not state how the ways were analyzed. The authors could have described the steps that were used for this analysis. 

## Addressing the Medium Priority Improvements
It is necessary to provide an explanation that how these 3D plots were created as well as what the main findings are. The authors should also consider using more concrete language in the text instead of abstract terms. It would be beneficial if the authors could describe their steps for the WWO analysis, and then they can explain the results from this analysis. 

## Addressing the High Priority Improvements
The high priority improvements for this manuscript are to add a summary of the findings as well as include figure legends. It is necessary that the authors provide an explanation that how these 3D plots were created, and there should be more details about what the main findings are.
