### ## English Abstract

This paper proposes a new algorithm for solving linear inverse problems that is based on an adaptive proximal gradient (APG) method. The APG method is an iterative process that alternates between two steps. In the first step, it performs a stochastic gradient descent update with a constant learning rate. In the second step, it uses the proximal operator of the regularized problem to obtain the next iterate. The algorithm is adaptive in the sense that the learning rate and regularization parameter are updated at each iteration based on the previous iterates. This paper shows that the APG method converges for a wide range of constant or vanishing learning rates, and the convergence rate can be faster than the gradient descent (GD) method with a fixed learning rate. The algorithm is also adaptive in the sense that it uses the proximal operator of the regularized problem to obtain the next iterate. This paper shows that the APG method converges for a wide range of constant or vanishing learning rates, and the convergence rate can be faster than the gradient descent (GD) method with a fixed learning rate. The algorithm is also adaptive in the sense that it uses the proximal operator of the regularized problem to obtain the next iterate. This paper shows that the APG method converges for a wide range of constant or vanishing learning rates, and the convergence rate can be faster than the gradient descent (GD) method with a fixed learning rate.

### ## English Abstract

This paper presents a novel optimization algorithm for large-scale machine learning that is based on the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method. The proposed algorithm, which we call Adam, is an adaptive version of the SGD algorithm that incorporates two main ideas. First, it maintains a moving average of the past gradients and uses this to normalize the current gradient when updating the model parameters. Second, it normalizes the magnitude of the moving average itself by dividing it by its Euclidean norm. The proposed Adam algorithm is simple to implement and can be used with any optimization objective that can be minimized in closed form. It is also easy to combine with other algorithms such as Nesterov's accelerated gradient (NAG) or the heavy-ball method. In this paper, we provide a theoretical analysis of the performance of the Adam algorithm. We show that it achieves the same convergence rate as the SGD and NAG algorithms in the nonconvex setting and has the same optimal rate of $O(1/k)$ for the strongly convex case. The proposed Adam algorithm is simple to implement and can be used with any optimization objective that can be minimized in closed form. It is also easy to combine with other algorithms such as Nesterov's accelerated gradient (NAG) or the heavy-ball method. In this paper, we provide a theoretical analysis of the performance of the Adam algorithm.

The manuscript "A Fast and Flexible Framework for Stochastic Optimization" by Brown et al. is an excellent piece of work that provides a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art in stochastic optimization. The authors present a new framework called "Stochastic Optimization with Adaptive Learning Rate (SOAR)" that can be used to solve a wide range of problems, including both convex and non-convex ones, and provide several theoretical results about its convergence. In this manuscript, the authors also implement SOAR on some classic stochastic optimization benchmarks and show that it outperforms many existing algorithms. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: (1) the authors present a new framework for solving stochastic problems with non-convex objectives; (2) they provide several theoretical results about the convergence of SOAR, including both the expected iteration complexity and the high-probability guarantee of its convergence; (3) they implement SOAR on some classic stochastic optimization benchmarks and show that it outperforms many existing algorithms.
