# Executive Summary

### Overview

This paper presents a new, high-performance, open-source optimization library for large-scale machine learning. The library is called Optuna and it is designed to be easy to use with minimal learning curve. It can be used as a drop-in replacement for the popular Adam optimizer in many deep learning frameworks and libraries. The authors of this manuscript have implemented the new algorithm in the PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Julia programming languages. They compare its performance on 13 different problems, including both classification and regression tasks, with the Adam algorithm. In all cases, the new algorithm performs better than or as well as the Adam algorithm. It is also compared to a number of other optimization algorithms that are not based on Adam. The authors have implemented the new algorithm in the PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Julia programming languages.

### Key Contributions

The key contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows: 
1. A new optimization algorithm called "AdamW" is presented.
2. The performance of the new algorithm is compared to that of Adam on 13 different problems with a variety of sizes and complexities.
3. The authors have implemented the new algorithm in three popular deep learning frameworks, including PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Julia.

### Principal Results

The principal results are as follows: 
1. On all 13 problems, the performance of the "AdamW" algorithm is better than or at least as good as that of Adam.
2. The authors have implemented the new algorithm in three popular deep learning frameworks, including PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Julia.

### Significance and Impact

The significance and impact of this paper can be summarized as follows: 
1. This paper presents a new optimization algorithm called "AdamW" which is designed to be easy to use with minimal learning curve.

# Quality Review

**Overall Quality Score: 4/5**

The paper is well-structured and generally easy to follow, but there are some issues with clarity of presentation that detract from the overall score.

**Clarity Assessment: 3.75/5**

The manuscript is clear in terms of the mathematical derivations and theorems presented; however, the introduction and related sections could be improved for non-experts. The paper assumes a high level of prior knowledge about optimization methods. For example, it does not explain what an objective function is or why this is important to solve. It also uses technical jargon without definition (e.g., "convergence metrics" in section 3.1), which may be confusing for readers who are not familiar with the field. The paper could benefit from a glossary of terms at the end, especially if the authors wish to reach a broader audience than just optimization experts.

**Structure and Organization: 4/5**

The introduction is too short to provide context for the reader. The related work section should be expanded on the main results in the field that are not mentioned (e.g., the stochastic gradient descent method), as well as how this relates to other methods. This is particularly important if the authors wish to reach a broader audience than just optimization experts.

**Technical Accuracy: 5/5**

The paper is technically sound and accurate in its derivations of theorems. The main results are not new, but the presentation is clear and the proofs are correct. There is no issue with the content that I could find.

**Readability: 3.25/5**

There are a few places where there is confusion about what is being discussed (e.g., section 2.1), which may be due to the use of overly technical terms. The paper is generally well-written, but it could benefit from more attention to how the results will be received by readers who do not have a background in optimization.

**Specific Issues Found:**

* The introduction should provide context for the reader.
* The related work section needs to be expanded on the main results in the field that are not mentioned (e.g., the stochastic gradient descent method), as well as how this relates to other methods. This is particularly important if the authors wish to reach a broader audience than just optimization experts.
* The paper could benefit from more attention to how the results will be received by readers who do not have a background in optimization.

**Recommendations:**

1. Provide context for the reader, especially non-experts, in the introduction. This is particularly important if the authors wish to reach a broader audience than just optimization experts.
2. Expand on the main results in the related work section (e.g., the stochastic gradient descent method), as well as how this relates to other methods.
3. Pay more attention to how the results will be received by readers who do not have a background in optimization.

# Methodology Review

**Methodology Overview**

The authors of this paper provide a comprehensive framework for testing the performance of optimization algorithms with respect to two important criteria, scalability and convergence. The study is based on the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm which is widely used in deep learning. The SGD family includes Adam, RMSProp, Adagrad, AdaGrad, and AdamW. However, these methods are not well understood, and their relative performance is unclear. In this paper, the authors provide a systematic analysis of the SGD family by providing an upper bound for the convergence rate of each algorithm in the nonconvex setting and a lower bound for the convergence rate of each algorithm in the convex setting. The authors also show that the difference between the upper and lower bounds is exactly the computational complexity. The paper is well-organized and the methodology is novel, but it may be hard to understand without some background knowledge about optimization algorithms.

**Research Design Assessment**

The study provides a systematic analysis of the SGD family by providing an upper bound for the convergence rate of each algorithm in the nonconvex setting and a lower bound for the convergence rate of each algorithm in the convex setting. The authors also show that the difference between the upper and lower bounds is exactly the computational complexity.

**Strengths**

1. **Novel Methodology**: This study provides a novel methodology for testing the performance of different optimization algorithms with respect to two important criteria, scalability and convergence.
2. **Comprehensive Analysis**: The authors provide a comprehensive analysis of the SGD family by providing an upper bound for the convergence rate of each algorithm in the nonconvex setting and a lower bound for the convergence rate of each algorithm in the convex setting. This is very useful because the difference between the upper and lower bounds is exactly the computational complexity.

**Weaknesses**

1. **Lack of Background Knowledge**: The authors assume that readers are familiar with optimization algorithms, but this may not be the case for all readers. It would be helpful if the authors provide a brief introduction to the SGD family in the paper.
2. **Hard to Understand Without Background Knowledge**: This study is based on the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm which is widely used in deep learning.

In this paper, the authors provide a systematic analysis of the SGD family by providing an upper bound for the convergence rate of each algorithm in the nonconvex setting and a lower bound for the convergence rate of each algorithm in the convex setting.

The paper is well-organized and the methodology is novel, but it may be hard to understand without some background knowledge about optimization algorithms.

Abstract: The stochastic gradient descent (SGD) family includes Adam, RMSProp, Adagrad, AdaGrad, and AdamW. However, the relative performance of these algorithms is unclear in the nonconvex setting. In this paper, we show that the difference between the upper and lower bounds for the convergence rate of each algorithm in the convex setting is exactly the computational complexity, and therefore the SGD family can be ordered by their computational complexity. The ordering is $\text{AdaGrad} \succ\text{AdamW}\succ\text{Ada} \succ\text{Adagrad}\succ\text{RMSProp}$.

Keywords: stochastic gradient descent, nonconvex optimization, convergence rate, computational complexity

# Improvement Suggestions

## Summary

The manuscript is well-organized and easy to follow, but there are a few areas that could be improved upon. The main issues lie in the writing style, organization, and the presentation of the results.

## High Priority Improvements

### 1. Writing Style

The writing style is very formal which makes it difficult for non-experts to read. The manuscript should be more concise with short sentences. It would also help if the abstract was rewritten to include some of the main points from the introduction and conclusion, as well as a brief overview of what the paper does.

### 2. Organization

The manuscript is very long which makes it difficult for readers to follow. There are too many figures and tables that do not add much value to the text. The results section should be organized in a more logical manner, with the main points from the introduction being summarized first, then the results of the experiments, and finally the conclusion.

### 3. Presentation

The presentation is very good, but the paper could benefit if there was a brief summary at the beginning of each section that explained what it would cover. The abstract should also be rewritten to include some of the main points from the introduction and conclusion as well as a brief overview of what the paper does.

## Medium Priority Improvements

### 1. Introduction

The manuscript could benefit if there was a clear statement about what the paper is going to do, which would help readers understand the purpose of the paper before they read it. The abstract should also be rewritten to include some of the main points from the introduction and conclusion as well as a brief overview of what the paper does.

### 2. Results

The results section could benefit if there was a clear statement about what the section is going to cover, which would help readers understand the purpose of the section before they read it. The presentation of the results should also be more concise with short sentences. There are too many tables and figures that do not add much value to the text. The conclusion could benefit if there was a clear statement about what the paper does, as well as some of the main points from the introduction.

## Low Priority Improvements

### 2. Results

The manuscript is very long which makes it difficult for readers to follow. There are too many tables that do not add much value to the text. The presentation of the results should be more concise with short sentences. There are also too many figures that do not add much value to the text, and some of them could be grouped together.

### 3. Conclusion

The manuscript is very long which makes it difficult for readers to follow. It would help if there was a clear statement about what the paper does, as well as some of the main points from the introduction. The abstract should also be rewritten to include some of the main points from the introduction and conclusion.
