## English Abstract

The House of Knowledge (HoK) is a unique framework that organizes and interconnects diverse ways of thinking about things in a comprehensive manner. This manuscript presents the first characterization of the 24 rooms of the HoK, which are organized into four categories: the three categories of the original framework (theoretical, practical, and aesthetic), and an additional category that is not part of the original framework but is also important for understanding the ways of thinking about things. The data were collected from a variety of sources, including philosophical texts, educational literature, psychological research, and social media. The analysis was based on the 24 rooms of the HoK, which are organized into four categories: theoretical (n=6), practical (n=8), aesthetic (n=5), and not part of the original framework (n=5). The results show that the ways of thinking about things in the theoretical category include a variety of philosophical perspectives. In the practical category, there is a range of different approaches to problem-solving. The aesthetic category includes a range of creative and artistic ways of thinking about things. The not part of the original framework category includes a range of different types of knowledge that are important for understanding the ways of thinking about things in the other three categories. The results also show that there is a significant diversity across all four categories in terms of the number of ways, the proportion of each way, and the distribution of the ways across the four categories. The analysis provides a comprehensive characterization of the 24 rooms of the HoK, which can be used to understand the nature of the framework and how it might be applied in different contexts.

本文首次对House of Knowledge（HoK）进行了全面的描述。该框架将不同方式的思考组织起来，并且在四个类别中相互连接。数据来自哲学文献、教育文学和社交媒体等多种来源。分析基于HoK的24个房间，这些房间被组织到四个类别：理论（n=6）、实践（n=8）、美学（n=5）和不是原有框架的一部分（n=5）。结果表明，理论类别中包括多种哲学观点。实践类别中有不同解决问题的方法。美学类别中包括多种艺术和创造性的思考方式。不是原有框架的一部分类别中包括了HoK中其他三类别所需的知识。结果也表明，在这四个类别中都存在很大的多样性：在所有类别中，方法的数量、每种方法占比和分布都不同。在分析中，我们对HoK的24个房间进行了全面的描述，这些描述可以用来理解框架的本质和如何将其应用于不同的背景下。

Title: Ways of Figuring Things Out: A Systematic Analysis of a Framework for Characterizing and Analyzing Knowledge Systems

Abstract:

The House of Knowledge (HoK) is a framework that has been used in various disciplines to represent the relationships among different types of knowledge. The ways of figuring things out that are represented in the HoK can be characterized by their characteristics, which include the way they are used, the context in which they are used, and the way they relate to one another. This paper presents a system for characterizing and analyzing these ways of figuring things out. The framework is based on an analysis of 24 philosophical questions that were posed in the House of Knowledge. The ways of figuring things out can be characterized by their characteristics, which include the way they are used, the context in which they are used, and the way they relate to one another. This paper presents a system for characterizing and analyzing these ways of figuring things out.

## English Abstract

The paper describes a system of ways to figure things out that is based on the House of Knowledge framework and the theory of multiple intelligences. The main goal of this work is to create an integrated system for characterizing and analyzing the diversity of ways in which people can think, reason, learn, and solve problems. A set of 24 rooms in the House of Knowledge represents a wide range of philosophical questions that are used as a basis for the analysis of the diversity of ways in which people can figure things out. The framework is based on the theory of multiple intelligences by Howard Gardner. The system of characterizing and analyzing the diversity of ways in which people can think, reason, learn, and solve problems includes 5 categories: the House of Knowledge as a whole, the way of thinking (the method), the room (the subject area), the question (the philosophical problem), the way of reasoning (the approach), the way of solving the problem (the method), and the way of being in the world. The diversity of ways is characterized by 5 dimensions: the way of thinking, the way of being in the world, the way of solving problems, the interconnectedness of ways, the coverage of the framework with the diversity of ways, and the coverage of the diversity of ways with the categories of the framework. The system of characterizing and analyzing the diversity of ways is based on the statistical analysis and the graph-based network analysis. The results of the statistical analysis are presented in the form of 5 tables that contain the descriptive statistics for each category. The results of the graph-based network analysis are presented as a set of interconnectedness metrics. The paper also includes the description of the House of Knowledge framework, the theory of multiple intelligences by Howard Gardner, and the ways to figure things out based on this theory. The main findings of the statistical analysis are that the way of thinking is the most diverse dimension in the system of characterizing and analyzing the diversity of ways, the least diverse dimension is the way of being in the world, and the coverage of the framework with the diversity of ways is 0.83. The results of the graph-based network analysis show that the interconnectedness of ways is not a random process but has some regularities. The main findings are that the most interconnected categories are the room (the subject area) and the way of solving problems, the least interconnected category is the House of Knowledge as a whole, and the coverage of the framework with the diversity of ways is 0.83. The results of the analysis can be used to develop a system for characterizing and analyzing the diversity of ways that can be applied in various areas of research and practice.

## Russian Перевод

Система фигурования вещей основана на фреймворке Дома Знания и теории множественных способностей. Цель данной работы – создать систему, характеризирующую и анализирующую разнообразие способов, которые люди используют для мышления, решений проблем и обучения. В системе 24 комнаты Дома Знания представляют собой широкий спект философских вопросов, используемых в качестве основы для анализа разнообразия способов. Фреймворк основан на теории множественных способностей Говарда Гарднера. Система характеризации и анализа разнообразия способов включает 5 категорий: Дом Знания в целом, способ мышления (метод), комната (предмет), вопрос (философская проблема), способ рассуждения (метод), способ решения проблемы (метод) и способ быть в мире. Разнообразие способов характеризируется 5 измерениями: способ мышления, способ быть в мире, способ решать задачу, взаимосвязанность способов, охватываемость системы фреймворка с разнообразием способов и охватываемость системы фреймворка с категориями. Система характеризации и анализа разнообразия способов основана на статистическом анализе и графоориентированном анализе. Результаты статистического анализа представлены в виде 5 таблиц, которые содержат описательные статистические данные для каждой категории. Результаты графоориентированного анализа представлены в виде метрик взаимосвязанности. В работе также приводится описание фреймворка Дома Знания, теория множественных способностей Говарда Гарднера и способы фигурования вещей на основе этой теории. Основными результатами статистического анализа являются то, что способ мышления является наиболее разнообразной измерением в системе характеризации и анализа разнообразия способов, а также то, что охватываемость системы фреймворка с категориями составляет 0.83. Результаты графоориентированного анализа показывают, что взаимосвязанность способов не является случайным процессом, но имеет некоторые регулярности. Основными результатами являются то, что наиболее взаимосвязанные категории – комната (предмет), способ решать задачу, а также то, что охватываемость системы фреймворка с категориями составляет 0.83. Результаты анализа могут быть использованы для создания системы характеризации и анализа разнообразия способов, которая может быть применена в различных областях исследования и практики.
