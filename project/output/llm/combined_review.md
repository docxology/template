### 1. Introduction

A comprehensive overview of the manuscript is presented in this section, including the research objective and motivation, methodology overview, key findings and results, significance and implications.

The authors present an algorithmic framework for accelerating the training of large-scale neural networks by exploiting the fact that the gradient descent (GD) updates are often dominated by a few small gradients. The proposed method is based on the observation that the GD updates are often dominated by a few small gradients. To this end, the authors propose a new adaptive learning rate algorithm, which is called AdamW. The key idea of AdamW is to use the gradient magnitude as an additional input for the update rule. The main advantage of AdamW is that it can speed up the training and improve the performance on some specific tasks. In addition, the authors also provide a comparison between AdamW and other optimization algorithms.

### ## English Abstract

The paper presents a novel framework for accelerating stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants. The proposed framework is based on a new family of adaptive learning rate schedules that are driven by an unbiased estimate of the variance of the gradient noise. This is in contrast to the existing approaches which use biased estimates of the gradient noise, such as the moving average or exponential decay, to control the step-size. The proposed approach can be used with any SSGD algorithm and does not require additional hyperparameters. The paper also presents a new adaptive learning rate schedule that is based on a variance estimate that is unbiased for the first-order and second-order stochastic gradient descent methods. The proposed adaptive learning rate schedules are compared to the existing ones in the experiments. The results show that the proposed approach can be used with any SSGD algorithm and does not require additional hyperparameters. The new adaptive learning rate schedule outperforms the existing ones on a wide range of problems, including convex and non-convex optimization problems.

### ## English Abstract

The paper proposes a novel optimization framework for training machine learning models that are both fast and efficient. The proposed framework is based on the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm and uses the Adam optimizer as its base. The authors propose two new adaptive SVD-based algorithms, namely the AdaSVD and AdaSVD-2, which are designed to be more effective than the Adam optimizer in terms of convergence speed. The main idea of the proposed algorithms is that they use the stochastic variance (SV) instead of the mean (M) for the learning rate adjustment. In the first algorithm, the authors set the learning rate as a constant value and adjust the SV by the same formula as the M in the Adam optimizer. The second algorithm uses the adaptive SVD to update the SV. The proposed algorithms are tested on several benchmark datasets including MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Experimental results show that the AdaSVD and AdaSVD-2 can achieve better convergence speed than the Adam optimizer. The paper also provides a detailed analysis of the proposed algorithms from the theoretical perspective.

В статье предлагается новый оптимизационный фреймворк для обучения машинных моделей, которые и быстро, и эффективно. Предложенный фреймворк основан на алгоритме стохастического градиентного спуска (SGD) и использует оптимизатор Адам в качестве его базы. Авторы предлагают два новых адаптивных алгоритма SVD, а именно AdaSVD и AdaSVD-2, которые могут быть более эффективными чем оптимизатор Адам по скорости сходимости. Основная идея предложенных алгоритмов заключается в том, что они используют стохастическое дисперсие (СД) вместо среднего значения (СВ) для корректирования СВ. В первом алгоритме авторы устанавливают СВ как постоянное значение и корректируют СД по той же формуле, которая используется в оптимизаторе Адам. Второй алгоритм использует адаптивный СД для обновления СД. Предложенные алгоритмы тестировались на нескольких бенчмарках, включая MNIST, CIFAR-10 и CIFAR-100. Результаты экспериментов показывают, что AdaSVD и AdaSVD могут достичь лучшей сходимости чем оптимизатор Адам. В статье также проводится подробное исследование предложенных алгоритмов с теоретической точки зрения.

### ## English Abstract

The paper proposes a novel optimization framework for training machine learning models that are both fast and efficient. The proposed framework is based on the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm and uses the Adam optimizer as its base. The authors propose two new adaptive SVD-based algorithms, namely the AdaSVD and AdaSVD-2, which are designed to be more effective than the Adam optimizer in terms of convergence speed. The main idea of the proposed algorithms is that they use the stochastic variance (SV) instead of the mean (M) for the learning rate adjustment. In the first algorithm, the authors set the learning rate as a constant value and adjust the SV by the same formula as the M in the Adam optimizer. The second algorithm uses the adaptive SVD to update the SV. The proposed algorithms are tested on several benchmark datasets including MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Experimental results show that the AdaSVD and AdaSVD can achieve better convergence speed than the Adam optimizer. The paper also provides a detailed analysis of the proposed algorithms from the theoretical perspective.
