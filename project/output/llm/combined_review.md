### ## English Abstract

This paper proposes a new algorithm for stochastic optimization that is adaptive to the learning rate and converges faster than existing algorithms. The proposed algorithm, called Adam, combines the advantages of two popular methods for stochastic gradient descent (SGD): the stochastic average gradient (SAG) method and the exponential weight update (AdamW) method. SAG is a simple, intuitive, and widely used algorithm that has been shown to be effective in practice. However, it does not adapt well to the learning rate. AdamW adapts the learning rate by exponentially weighing the squared gradient, but its theoretical analysis is lacking. The proposed Adam algorithm combines the advantages of these two methods: it adapts the learning rate and converges faster than SAG. In this paper, we analyze the convergence of the proposed Adam algorithm under a very mild condition that is also assumed in the analysis for the AdamW method. We show that the proposed Adam algorithm has a better theoretical guarantee than the AdamW method. The proposed Adam algorithm can be used to solve both convex and non-convex problems. Experiments on several large-scale machine learning benchmarks demonstrate that it converges faster than existing algorithms.

本文提出了一种新的随机优化算法，该算法适应学习率，并且比现有算法更快地收敛。该算法，称为Adam，是将两种流行的SGD方法结合：随机平均梯度(SAG)方法和指数加权更新(AdamW)方法。SAG是简单、直观、广泛使用的一种算法，但它不太适应学习率。AdamW通过指数加权更新对学习率进行了调整，但是其理论分析缺乏。该提出的Adam算法将这两个优点结合：它适应学习率，并且比SAG更快地收敛。在本文中，我们对该提出的Adam算法的收敛性进行了分析，假设的条件也被用在对AdamW方法的分析中。我们证明，该提出的Adam算法有一个更好的理论保证于AdamW算法。该提出的Adam算法可以用于解决大规模机器学习问题。实验结果表明，它比现有算法更快地收敛。

### ## English Abstract


This paper presents a novel approach to the problem of accelerating the convergence of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for training deep neural networks. The key idea is to use an adaptive learning rate that depends on the magnitude of the gradient, and which is independent of the iteration number. This is in contrast to the standard practice where the learning rate is fixed or decreased with the iteration number. In this paper, we show that such a strategy can be implemented by using the stochastic average gradient (SAG) algorithm, and that it has the same convergence guarantee as SAG for strongly convex objectives. The SAG algorithm is an adaptive version of SGD which uses the moving average to update the learning rate. This is in contrast to Adam, which also uses the moving average but with a different strategy. We provide the first non-asymptotic analysis of the SAG algorithm and show that it has the same convergence guarantee as SAG for strongly convex objectives. The main contribution of this paper is the new analysis of the SAG algorithm, and the key finding is that the SAG algorithm can be used to accelerate the training of deep neural networks with a strong adaptive learning rate. We provide an extensive experimental study on the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which shows that it can achieve better performance than Adam for many problems. The main contributions are as follows.
Firstly, we show that the SAG algorithm has the same convergence guarantee as SAG for strongly convex objectives. This is in contrast to Adam, which has a different convergence guarantee. Secondly, we provide an extensive experimental study on the effectiveness of the proposed approach. We compare the performance of the proposed adaptive learning rate with the standard fixed and decreasing strategies, and show that it can achieve better performance than these two baselines for many problems. The main contributions are as follows.

### ## English Abstract

The manuscript provides a comprehensive overview of an empirical study that aims to evaluate the performance of Adam and other stochastic gradient descent (SGD) variants on a set of 12 benchmark problems. The authors' main goal is to compare the convergence properties of these SGD methods under different conditions, including the number of training iterations, mini-batch size, learning rate, and noise level. They find that Adam's performance is not always better than other SGD methods in terms of the speedup per resource ratio (efficiency). The authors also claim that their study provides a framework for evaluating the convergence properties of optimization algorithms.

The main contributions of this work are the following: 1) they provide a set of benchmarks to evaluate the performance of various optimization algorithms; 2) they show that Adam is not always better than other SGD methods in terms of the speedup per resource ratio (efficiency); and 3) their study provides a framework for evaluating the convergence properties of optimization algorithms. The authors' main goal is to compare the convergence properties of these SGD methods under different conditions, including the number of training iterations, mini-batch size, learning rate, and noise level.

The authors first provide an overview of the Adam algorithm. Then they describe their benchmarks. They also discuss the methodology used in this study.

They find that Adam's performance is not always better than other SGD methods in terms of the speedup per resource ratio (efficiency). The authors also claim that their study provides a framework for evaluating the convergence properties of optimization algorithms.

The main findings of this work are as follows: 1) they show that Adam performs well when the number of training iterations is large, and its performance is not always better than other SGD methods in terms of the speedup per resource ratio (efficiency); 2) they find that the performance of Adam improves with the increase of the mini-batch size; 3) they observe that the performance of Adam does not improve when the learning rate increases, and its performance is not always better than other SGD methods in terms of the speedup per resource ratio (efficiency); and 4) they find that the performance of Adam improves with the increase of the noise level. The authors also claim that their study provides a framework for evaluating the convergence properties of optimization algorithms.

### ## English Abstract

The manuscript provides a comprehensive overview of an empirical study that aims to evaluate the performance of Adam and other stochastic gradient descent (SGD) variants on a set of 12 benchmark problems. The authors' main goal is to compare the convergence properties of these SGD methods under different conditions, including the number of training iterations, mini-batch size, learning rate, and noise level. They find that Adam's performance is not always better than other SGD methods in terms of the speedup per resource ratio (efficiency). The authors also claim that their study provides a framework for evaluating the convergence properties of optimization algorithms.

The main contributions of this work are the following: 1) they provide a set of benchmarks to evaluate the performance of various optimization algorithms; 2) they show that Adam's performance is not always better than other SGD methods in terms of the speedup per resource ratio (efficiency); and 3) their study provides a framework for evaluating the convergence properties of optimization algorithms. The authors' main goal is to compare the convergence properties of these SGD methods under different conditions, including the number of training iterations, mini-batch size, learning rate, and noise level. They find that Adam's performance is not always better than other SGD methods in terms of the speedup per resource ratio (efficiency). The authors also claim that their study provides a framework for evaluating the convergence properties of optimization algorithms.

The main findings of this work are as follows: 1) they show that Adam performs well when the number of training iterations is large, and its performance is not always better than other SGD methods in terms of the speedup per resource ratio (efficiency); 2) they find that the performance of Adam improves with the increase of the mini-batch size; 3) they observe that the performance of Adam does not improve when the learning rate increases, and its performance is not always better than other SGD methods in terms of the speedup per resource ratio (efficiency); and 4) they find that the performance of Adam improves with the increase of the noise level. The authors also claim that their study provides a framework for evaluating the convergence properties of optimization algorithms.

The significance and implications of this work are as follows: 1) the authors' evaluation of the performance of various SGD methods can be used to evaluate other optimization algorithms; 2) the authors' study can provide insights into the design of new optimization algorithms that outperform Adam in certain scenarios; and 3) the authors' framework for evaluating the convergence properties of optimization algorithms can be applied to evaluate the performance of other optimization algorithms.
