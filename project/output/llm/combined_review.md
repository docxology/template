### ## English Abstract

The manuscript presents a novel framework for adaptive optimization of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants. The proposed method is based on the observation that SGD can be viewed as an instance of the first-order proximal-point algorithm with a special choice of the proximal mapping, which allows us to leverage the convergence theory of the first-order proximal point algorithm in the nonconvex setting. In this manuscript, we show that the proposed method is able to achieve the optimal rate for the nonconvex optimization problem. The proposed method can be viewed as an instance of the first-order proximal-point algorithm with a special choice of the proximal mapping, which allows us to leverage the convergence theory of the first-order proximal point algorithm in the nonconvex setting.

### ## English Abstract

**Research Objective and Motivation**
The paper proposes a new algorithm for adaptive subgradient methods that is able to achieve faster convergence rates than existing ones. The authors are motivated by the fact that many of the most popular optimization algorithms, such as Adam, Adagrad, RMSProp, etc., have been developed in recent years based on the stochastic gradient (SG) method and its variants. However, these algorithms do not take into account the important feature of the adaptive subgradient methods: they are able to adaptively adjust their step sizes according to the current gradient information. In this paper, the authors propose a new algorithm that is able to achieve faster convergence rates than existing ones by using the adaptive subgradient method and its variants.

**Methodology Overview**
The proposed algorithm is based on the stochastic average gradient (SAG) method with an adaptive learning rate. The SAG method is a simple and intuitive optimization algorithm, which is widely used in various applications of machine learning. It has been shown that the SAG method can achieve faster convergence rates than the SGD method when the variance of the gradient is small. In this paper, the authors propose to use an adaptive learning rate for the SAG method. The new algorithm is called AdaS and it is a simple variant of the SAG method with an adaptive learning rate. The authors show that the SAG method can achieve faster convergence rates than the SGD method when the variance of the gradient is small, but in this paper, they prove that the SAG method can also be accelerated by using an adaptive learning rate.

**Key Findings and Results**
The main result of this paper is a new algorithm called AdaS. The authors show that the proposed algorithm is able to achieve faster convergence rates than existing ones. This is achieved with the help of the following two techniques: (1) the SAG method can be accelerated by using an adaptive learning rate; (2) the adaptive subgradient methods can be accelerated by using a new adaptive learning rate. The authors provide several numerical experiments and theoretical results to support their claims.

**Significance and Implications**
The proposed algorithm is able to achieve faster convergence rates than existing ones. This is achieved with the help of the following two techniques: (1) the SAG method can be accelerated by using an adaptive learning rate; (2) the adaptive subgradient methods can be accelerated by using a new adaptive learning rate. The authors provide several numerical experiments and theoretical results to support their claims. The proposed algorithm has been tested on 10 different datasets, including the MNIST dataset, CIFAR-10 dataset, etc. The experimental results show that the AdaS method is able to achieve faster convergence rates than existing ones. This paper provides a new perspective for the optimization of the adaptive subgradient methods and it can be used in many applications of machine learning.

**Цель и мотивация исследования**
В статье предлагается новый алгоритм, который может ускорить сходимость более быстрыми, чем существующие. Авторы мотивированы тем, что многие из наиболее популярных оптимизационных алгоритмов, такие как Adam, Adagrad, RMSProp и т.д., были разработаны в последние годы на основе метода стохастического градиента (СГ) и его модификаций.

I think there is a small error in the translation. The last sentence of the abstract should be translated as:

«Предлагаемый алгоритм ускоряет сходимость более быстрыми, чем существующие. Это достигается с помощью следующих двух приёмов: (1) метод СМГ может быть ускорен адаптивным шагом; (2) адаптивные СГ могут быть ускорены новым адаптивным шагом. Авторы предлагают несколько численных экспериментов и теоретических результатов, чтобы подтвердить свои утверждения. В предлагаемый алгоритм были проведены 10 различных экспериментов на следующих данных: MNIST, CIFAR-10 и т.д. Экспериментальные результаты показывают, что метод AdaS ускоряет сходимость более быстрыми, чем существующие.»

Thank you for pointing out the mistake! I will make sure to correct it. The last sentence of the abstract should be translated as:
