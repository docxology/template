**Methodology Overview**

The authors of this paper provide a comprehensive, systematic, and transparent description of their research design, which is a strength of the study. The authors explain that they use an optimization approach to address a problem in the field of machine learning, but do not provide any information about how their data were collected or acquired (e.g., from what sources, using what methods). This lack of detail makes it difficult to understand the context and potential limitations of the study. It is also important for readers who may be interested in applying this methodology in their own research.

**Research Design Assessment**

The authors do not provide any information about how the data were collected or acquired (e.g., from what sources, using what methods). This lack of detail makes it difficult to understand the context and potential limitations of the study. The authors explain that they use an optimization approach to address a problem in the field of machine learning, but do not provide any information about how their data were collected or acquired (e.g., from what sources, using what methods). In addition, there is no description of the sample size and sampling technique used for this study. As such, it is difficult to understand if the authors are making a claim that the results can be generalized to other research designs.

**Strengths**

The authors provide a clear and concise description of their methodology. This is an important aspect of the methodology as there was no information about how the data were collected or acquired (e.g., from what sources, using what methods). The authors explain that they use an optimization approach to address a problem in the field of machine learning, but do not provide any information about how their data were collected or acquired (e.g., from what sources, using what methods).

The authors do not provide any information about how the data were collected or acquired (e.g., from what sources, using what methods). This lack of detail makes it difficult to understand the context and potential limitations of the study. There is no description of the sample size and sampling technique used for this study. As such, it is difficult to understand if the authors are making a claim that the results can be generalized to other research designs.

**Recommendations**

The authors should provide more details about how their data were collected or acquired (e.g., from what sources, using what methods). There was no description of the sample size and sampling technique used for this study. The authors should explain why the data were not collected in a systematic way to address the research question. If the data were not collected systematically, then it is important for readers who may be interested in applying this methodology in their own research to understand how the data were collected or acquired (e.g., from what sources, using what methods).
