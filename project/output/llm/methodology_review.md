## Methodology Overview

The manuscript presents a novel optimization framework centered around an adaptive step size algorithm for iterative solution finding. The core methodology employs a mathematical framework expressed through equations (3.1) – (3.7), utilizing a key component: an adaptive step size strategy (3.5). The algorithm’s design incorporates a momentum term (3.3) to accelerate convergence and mitigate the challenges of non-convex optimization problems. The framework’s key strength lies in its ability to achieve linear convergence with a rate of (0, 1) under specific conditions, as detailed in Section 3.1. The algorithm is designed to solve optimization problems of the form f(x) = n
i=1
wii(x) + R(x) where wii(x) are learned weights and R(x) is a regularization term.

## Research Design Assessment

The research design employs a theoretical and experimental approach to evaluate the proposed optimization framework. The theoretical analysis, outlined in Section 3, establishes the convergence guarantees and complexity bounds. The experimental validation, detailed in Section 4, uses benchmark datasets to assess the algorithm’s performance across diverse problem types. The design incorporates a systematic approach, using a defined set of parameters and metrics to measure the algorithm's effectiveness. However, the design lacks a detailed discussion of the assumptions underlying the convergence guarantees, particularly regarding the smoothness and convexity of the objective function. The experimental setup, while comprehensive, could benefit from a more rigorous comparison against state-of-the-art methods, including a detailed analysis of the computational cost and memory requirements. The framework’s reliance on adaptive step sizes, while a key strength, warrants further investigation into the sensitivity of the algorithm to changes in the problem parameters.

## Strengths

The primary strength of the manuscript lies in its theoretical foundation, establishing linear convergence with a rate of (0, 1) under the specified conditions (Section 3.1). This theoretical guarantee provides a robust basis for the algorithm’s performance. The adaptive step size strategy (3.5) is a key innovation, dynamically adjusting the step size based on the gradient, which is crucial for handling non-convex optimization problems. The algorithm’s complexity analysis, demonstrating O(n log n) per-iteration complexity, is a significant advantage, particularly for large-scale problems. The experimental validation, using benchmark datasets, provides empirical evidence supporting the theoretical claims. The inclusion of a momentum term (3.3) further enhances the algorithm’s ability to accelerate convergence.

## Weaknesses

The manuscript’s methodology exhibits several weaknesses. The convergence guarantees are contingent on strong assumptions regarding the smoothness and convexity of the objective function, which are not explicitly stated. The lack of a detailed discussion of these assumptions limits the algorithm’s applicability to more general problem classes. The experimental validation, while demonstrating performance, lacks a thorough comparison against state-of-the-art methods, particularly in terms of computational cost and memory usage. The adaptive step size strategy, while effective, could be sensitive to changes in the problem parameters, requiring careful tuning. The manuscript does not fully address the potential for numerical instability associated with adaptive step size algorithms. The algorithm’s reliance on a single adaptive step size strategy could be improved by incorporating multiple strategies.

## Recommendations

To strengthen the methodology, the authors should: 1. Explicitly state the assumptions regarding the smoothness and convexity of the objective function, providing a more rigorous justification for the convergence guarantees. 2. Conduct a more comprehensive comparison of the algorithm’s performance against state-of-the-art methods, including a detailed analysis of computational cost and memory usage. 3. Explore alternative adaptive step size strategies, such as incorporating multiple strategies or using robust tuning methods. 4. Include a discussion of potential numerical instability issues and propose mitigation strategies. 5. Provide a more detailed explanation of the implementation details, including the choice of data structures and the rationale behind the algorithm’s design.  Specifically, expanding on the algorithm’s sensitivity to initial conditions and parameter choices would be beneficial.
