## Methodology Overview

The manuscript presents a novel optimization framework centered around an adaptive step-size method, combining regularization and momentum techniques. The core algorithm, outlined in Section 3, iteratively updates the solution using a formula incorporating a gradient calculation, adaptive step size, and momentum term. The framework aims to achieve both theoretical convergence guarantees and practical performance. The manuscript emphasizes a linear complexity per iteration (O(n)) and a memory scaling of O(n), making it suitable for large-scale problems. The design leverages a stochastic variant, incorporating random sampling for enhanced robustness, particularly in non-convex scenarios, as detailed in Section 9.1.1. The overall approach prioritizes efficiency and scalability, aligning with the stated goals of the research.

## Research Design Assessment

The research design appears to be a solid, albeit somewhat standard, approach to optimization. The core of the design – the adaptive step-size method – is a well-established technique, as evidenced by references to Kingma and Ba [2015] and Duchi et al. [2011]. However, the manuscript’s strength lies in its attempt to rigorously validate this approach with a focus on theoretical guarantees and scalability. The inclusion of detailed analysis in Sections 3 and 9.1.1 suggests a strong emphasis on mathematical justification. The design’s reliance on stochastic methods, as highlighted in Section 9.1.1, represents a key element for handling non-convex problems, a common challenge in optimization. The framework's design incorporates a systematic approach to validation, including benchmarks and experimental evaluations (Section 4), suggesting a robust and well-controlled research design. The explicit acknowledgement of limitations and future work (Section 6) demonstrates a mature research approach.

## Strengths

The manuscript’s primary strength resides in its comprehensive theoretical analysis and experimental validation. The detailed mathematical framework presented in Section 3, with its emphasis on convergence guarantees (Section 3.1) and complexity analysis (Section 3.2), provides a strong foundation for the algorithm. The inclusion of a stochastic variant (Section 9.1.1) is a valuable addition, addressing the challenges of non-convex optimization. The experimental results, as demonstrated in Section 4, showcase the algorithm’s performance across diverse benchmark datasets, with reported convergence rates and scalability metrics. Specifically, the reported performance of the algorithm – achieving 94.3% success rate across diverse problem instances – is a notable strength. Furthermore, the explicit acknowledgement of limitations and the proposed future research directions (Section 6) demonstrate a mature and thoughtful research approach. The framework’s focus on scalability (O(n) complexity) is a significant advantage for large-scale problems.

## Weaknesses

Despite the strengths, the manuscript exhibits some methodological weaknesses. The description of the adaptive step-size rule (Section 3.3) lacks sufficient detail, making it difficult to fully understand the algorithm’s inner workings. The level of mathematical rigor could be strengthened by providing more explicit proofs or derivations. The experimental section (Section 4) presents a somewhat cursory overview of the benchmark datasets and performance metrics. A more in-depth analysis of the algorithm’s sensitivity to hyperparameters (as suggested in Section 11.4.1) would be beneficial. The reliance on a single adaptive step-size strategy (Section 3.3) could be broadened to explore alternative strategies. The description of the implementation details (Section 8.2.2) is brief and lacks specifics regarding the software environment and libraries used. Finally, the manuscript doesn’t fully address potential issues related to numerical stability, particularly when dealing with ill-conditioned problems.

## Recommendations

To improve the manuscript, several recommendations are offered: 1. Provide a more detailed explanation of the adaptive step-size rule, including the mathematical derivation and rationale. 2. Strengthen the theoretical analysis by providing explicit proofs or derivations for the convergence guarantees. 3. Expand the experimental section by presenting a more comprehensive analysis of the algorithm’s sensitivity to hyperparameters, including a systematic exploration of diﬀerent parameter settings. 4. Include a more detailed discussion of numerical stability considerations, particularly in the context of ill-conditioned problems. 5. Elaborate on the implementation details, specifying the software environment and libraries used. 6. Explore alternative adaptive step-size strategies beyond the current approach. 7. Conduct a thorough sensitivity analysis across a wider range of problem instances to assess the robustness of the algorithm.  These improvements would enhance the clarity, rigor, and practical value of the manuscript.
