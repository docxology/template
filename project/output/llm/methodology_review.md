### Methodology Overview

The manuscript provides a general overview of the methodology used in the study, which seems to be a simulation-based research paper. The methodology is presented in the last section of the report and it is not clear if any specific data were collected or analyzed in this study. However, there are some general descriptions that can be discussed. The first point to note is that the manuscript does not provide any information about the number of participants in the study. It is not possible to determine how many people participated in the study based on this report and it is unclear if data were collected from humans or animals. This could have been addressed by providing more detail about the methodology used, especially if the study was a simulation. The next point that can be discussed is the lack of information about the data collection method. It is not clear what type of data were collected and how they were collected. For example, it does not seem to say whether any in-person measurements were made or if all data were obtained from existing sources, such as databases. Additionally, there are no details provided about the data analysis method. Any statistical methods used for the analysis should be described in detail. The manuscript could also provide more detail about the literature review that was conducted. If a literature search was performed to identify previous studies or theories related to the topic of this study, it is not clear if any specific inclusion criteria were established for the selection of the articles that were included in the review and what types of articles were excluded from the search. The manuscript also does not provide information about the data analysis method. Any statistical methods used for the analysis should be described in detail.

### Research Design Assessment

The research design is based on a simulation study, which can be useful if the goal is to compare different algorithms or techniques. However, it is unclear what type of data were collected and how they were obtained. It would have been helpful if more information was provided about the methodology used in this study. If the study was a meta-analysis, then it should provide some details on the literature search that was performed. The manuscript does not appear to be a systematic review or meta-analysis, but rather is an original research paper. It could also be a case report or a descriptive study. If there are no data in this study, then it would have been helpful if more detail were provided about how the data were collected and what types of data were obtained. The manuscript does not provide any information about the number of participants in the study and it is unclear whether data were collected from humans or animals. It could be helpful to specify that the data collection method was based on a simulation, as this can help readers understand the purpose of the study better. A description of the data analysis method would also have been helpful.
