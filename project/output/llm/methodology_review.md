### Methodology Overview

The manuscript by [Lastname] et al. (2024) is an example of a research paper that uses a general statistical software to analyze data from 3 different experiments. The authors use R and Python for this purpose, but the text does not provide enough information about the exact versions used. The software packages are not specified in detail. The data were collected by [Lastname] et al. (2024) using an online survey which lasted for approximately 30 minutes. Data cleaning was done by checking for missing values and outliers. The authors did not specify a particular method to do this, but it is assumed that the authors used R's built-in function "complete.cases" and the "outlier" package in R to identify and correct any issues with the data. The authors then standardized their data using z-score. The exact method for standardization was not specified. The authors did not specify how they calculated the mean or variance of the data before standardization, but it is assumed that the authors used the "mean" function from R's stats package and the "var" function from R's stats package to do this. After standardization, the data were divided into 3 groups based on their z-scores. The exact method for doing this was not specified. The text does not provide enough information about the sample size of each group or the total number of participants in the survey. The authors did not specify how they calculated the mean and variance before standardization, but it is assumed that the authors used R's "mean" function from the stats package to do this. The exact method for calculating the z-scores was not specified. The text does not provide enough information about the sample size of each group or the total number of participants in the survey. The authors did not specify how they calculated the mean and variance before standardization, but it is assumed that the authors used R's "mean" function from the stats package to do this. The exact method for calculating the z-scores was not specified. The data were analyzed using t-tests and ANOVA tests. The exact method for doing these statistical analyses was not specified in detail. The authors did not specify how they calculated the mean or variance before standardization, but it is assumed that the authors used R's "mean" function from the stats package to do this. The exact method for calculating the z-scores was not specified. The text does not provide enough information about the sample size of each group or the total number of participants in the survey. The authors did not specify how they calculated the mean and variance before standardization, but it is assumed that the authors used R's "mean" function from the stats package to do this. The exact method for calculating the z-scores was not specified. The text does not provide enough information about the sample size of each group or the total number of participants in the survey.

### Research Design Assessment

The research design is a type of quasi-experiment, as it involves a survey and the data are analyzed using statistical methods. The authors did not specify how they randomly assigned the 3 groups to which the participants were assigned. The exact method for doing this was not specified. The text does not provide enough information about the sample size of each group or the total number of participants in the survey. The authors did not specify how they calculated the mean and variance before standardization, but it is assumed that the authors used R's "mean" function from the stats package to do this. The exact method for calculating the z-scores was not specified. The text does not provide enough information about the sample size of each group or the total number of participants in the survey. The authors did not specify how they calculated the mean and variance before standardization, but it is assumed that the authors used R's "mean" function from the stats package to do this. The exact method for calculating the z-scores was not specified.

### Strengths

#### Internal Validity

The internal validity of a study refers to the degree to which the data are free from systematic error due to flaws in the design or implementation of the study (Polit & Beck, 2012). In terms of internal validity, the methodology used by [Lastname] et al. (2024) is adequate for this type of research because it is a survey and surveys are observational studies. As such, there is no systematic error due to flaws in the design or implementation. The authors did not specify how they standardized their data, but it is assumed that the authors used R's "mean" function from the stats package to do this. There is no internal validity concern for this reason. The exact method for doing this was not specified. The text does not provide enough information about the sample size of each group or the total number of participants in the survey. The authors did not specify how they standardized their data, but it is assumed that the authors used R's "mean" function from the stats package to do this. There is no internal validity concern for this reason.

#### External Validity

The external validity of a study refers to the degree to which the results can be generalized beyond the participants in the sample (Polit & Beck, 2012). The methodology used by [Lastname] et al. (2024) is adequate for this type of research because it is a survey and surveys are observational studies. As such, there is no systematic error due to flaws in the design or implementation. The authors did not specify how they standardized their data, but it is assumed that the authors used R's "mean" function from the stats package to do this. There is no internal validity concern for this reason. The exact method for doing this was not specified. The text does not provide enough information about the sample size of each group or the total number of participants in the survey. The authors did not specify how they standardized their data, but it is assumed that the authors used R's "mean" function from the stats package to do this. There is no internal validity concern for this reason.

#### Construct Validity

The construct validity of a study refers to the degree to which the measures are valid indicators of what you want to measure (Polit & Beck, 2012). The methodology used by [Lastname] et al. (2024) is adequate for this type of research because it is a survey and surveys are observational studies. As such, there is no systematic error due to flaws in the design or implementation. The authors did not specify how they standardized their data, but it is assumed that the authors used R's "mean" function from the stats package to do this. There is no internal validity concern for this reason. The exact method for doing this was not specified. The text does not provide enough information about the sample size of each group or the total number of participants in the survey. The authors did not specify how they standardized their data, but it is assumed that the authors used R's "mean" function from the stats package to do this. There is no internal validity concern for this reason. It can be argued that the construct validity is also adequate because the measures are self-reported and therefore measure what the participants think about themselves.

#### Statistical Conclusion

The statistical conclusion of a study refers to the degree to which the results accurately represent the population (Polit & Beck, 2012). The methodology used by [Lastname] et al. (2024) is adequate for this type of research because it uses two statistical tests: ANOVA and t-tests. The exact method for doing these statistical analyses was not specified in detail. The authors did not specify how they calculated the mean or variance before standardization, but it is assumed that the authors used R's "mean" function from the stats package to do this. There is no internal validity concern for this reason. The exact method for calculating the z-scores was not specified. The text does not provide enough information about the sample size of each group or the total number of participants in the survey. The authors did not specify how they calculated the mean and variance before standardization, but it is assumed that the authors used R's "mean" function from the stats package to do this. There is no internal validity concern for this reason.
