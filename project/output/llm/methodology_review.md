### Methodology Overview

The manuscript, "Ways of Figuring Things Out: A System for Characterizing and Analyzing Ways of Figuring Things Out," is a comprehensive system for characterizing and analyzing ways of figuring things out. The authors present a novel approach to understanding the complex nature of human cognition that is grounded in the philosophical framework of John Dewey's (1916) theory of inquiry, which posits that there are multiple ways of knowing and valuing knowledge. This paper presents a system for characterizing and analyzing these different ways of figuring things out. The authors' methodology is to develop a comprehensive system for understanding how people figure things out in order to better understand the nature of human cognition. The authors' approach is based on Dewey's (1916) theory that there are multiple ways of knowing and valuing knowledge, which they call "ways." This paper presents a novel approach to understanding the complex nature of human cognition that is grounded in the philosophical framework of John Dewey's (1916) theory of inquiry. The authors' methodology is to develop a comprehensive system for understanding how people figure things out in order to better understand the nature of human cognition.

### Research Design Assessment

The manuscript does not present an explicit research design, but it does describe the steps that were taken to collect and organize data from 2010-2011. The authors do not provide information about the sample size or demographic characteristics of the participants who provided data for this study. It is unclear if the data was collected via a survey or interview format. The manuscript presents a list of ways of figuring things out that were gathered by Andrius Kulikauskas, but it does not describe how these data were analyzed. The authors do not provide information about the reliability and validity of the measures used in this study.

### Strengths

The strength of the manuscript is the development of a comprehensive system for understanding ways of figuring things out. This comprehensive approach to understanding human cognition is based on Dewey's (1916) theory that there are multiple ways of knowing and valuing knowledge. The authors' methodology is to develop a comprehensive system for understanding how people figure things out in order to better understand the nature of human cognition.

This paper presents a novel approach to understanding the complex nature of human cognition that is grounded in the philosophical framework of John Dewey's (1916) theory of inquiry.

### Weaknesses

The weakness of the manuscript is the lack of information about the sample size and demographic characteristics of the participants who provided data for this study. The authors do not provide information about how these data were analyzed. The manuscript does not present an explicit research design, but it does describe the steps that were taken to collect and organize data from 2010-2011. It is unclear if the data was collected via a survey or interview format. The manuscript presents a list of ways of figuring things out that were gathered by Andrius Kulikauskas, but it does not describe how these data were analyzed.

### Recommendations

The authors should provide information about the reliability and validity of the measures used in this study. The manuscript could present an explicit research design, which would be helpful for readers to understand the methodology of the study. The authors should also provide more detail about the steps that were taken to collect and organize data from 2010-2011. It is unclear if the data was collected via a survey or interview format. The manuscript presents a list of ways of figuring things out that were gathered by Andrius Kulikauskas, but it does not describe how these data were analyzed.
