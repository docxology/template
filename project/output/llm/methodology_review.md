## Methodology Overview

The manuscript provides a clear overview of the methodology used in the study, with the authors describing their approach to the problem as well as the methods and procedures that they followed. The paper is well-written and easy to follow for the most part, but there are some areas where more detail would be helpful. For example, it might be useful if the authors could provide a bit more information about how the data was collected or what specific statistical tests were used in the analysis. The authors also mention that they use the "scikit-learn" library for machine learning, which is an open-source software library for machine learning. However, there are no references to this source and it would be helpful if the authors could provide a reference so that readers can find more information about the library.

## Research Design Assessment

The research design is generally sound, with the authors using a clear approach to their problem. The use of the "scikit-learn" library for machine learning is an advantage as this is a well-established and widely used tool in the field. However, there are some areas where more detail would be helpful. For example, it might be useful if the authors could provide a bit more information about how the data was collected or what specific statistical tests were used in the analysis. The paper does not appear to have any major weaknesses.
