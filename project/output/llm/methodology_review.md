### Methodology Overview

The manuscript under review is a comprehensive report of an empirical study that explores the efficiency and scalability of a new optimization algorithm, Adam, for stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in large-scale machine learning. The authors begin by providing a detailed overview of the SAGD procedure, followed by a description of their research design. The methodology section is well-organized and easy to follow, with clear headings that separate the different components of the report.

### Research Design Assessment

The study is an empirical investigation into the efficiency and scalability of Adam in large-scale machine learning. The authors provide a detailed description of the algorithm and its application in this context. The research design is based on the SAGD procedure, which is described as follows: "We consider the following optimization problem: min f(x) where x 2 Rn is an n-dimensional real vector, and f : Rn!R is a convex function. In the stochastic case, the gradient g(f) is replaced by its empirical version g(f), which is obtained from a sample of i.i.d. data points." The authors then describe their algorithm as follows: "The Adam procedure can be viewed as an adaptive learning rate for SAGD. This is because the step size in each iteration depends on the past gradient values, and the learning rate is updated based on the moving average of the squared gradients. In the stochastic case, the step size in each iteration depends on the past gradient values, and the learning rate is updated based on the moving average of the squared gradients." The authors also provide a detailed description of their algorithm, which they call Adam. "The Adam procedure can be viewed as an adaptive learning rate for SAGD.
