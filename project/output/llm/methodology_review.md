## Methodology Overview

The manuscript by Bricken et al. (2022) presents a novel, formal approach to understanding the free energy principle (FEP). The authors propose that the FEP is grounded on a new foundation, which they call "boundary logic" and argue that this perspective offers an alternative to the traditional "free-energy-variational" formulation of the FEP. In the following sections, I will evaluate the research design and methodology used in the manuscript.

## Research Design Assessment

The authors do not explicitly state their research design but describe the approach as a formal development of the free energy principle. The manuscript is divided into two main parts: (1) an introduction to the FEP that provides context for the boundary logic perspective, and (2) a detailed presentation of the new formulation. This review will focus on the second part.

The authors provide a detailed outline of their approach in the introduction, but it is not clear whether this is a formal development or a conceptual analysis. The manuscript does not present an empirical study that can be assessed for its research design and methodology. In fact, the manuscript does not contain any data collection or analysis at all. Therefore, the following assessment will focus on the authors' approach to developing their boundary logic perspective.

The authors describe the FEP as a "theory" of how the brain works. The theory is based on the idea that the brain's goal is to achieve a state in which it has the least amount of free energy. This means that the brain is trying to minimize its internal energy (as opposed to maximizing its entropy) and that this energy is dependent on the information in the environment. They describe the FEP as an "alternative" to traditional thermodynamics, where the goal is to achieve a state with the most amount of entropy. The authors also discuss the relationship between the FEP and the Bayesian approach to perception, but it is not clear whether the manuscript will be discussing a new theory or a conceptual analysis. In any case, the following assessment will focus on the development of their boundary logic perspective.

## Strengths

The strengths of this manuscript are in its formalism and the clarity with which the authors describe their ideas. The authors provide an outline of their approach that is easy to follow and understand. One strength of this manuscript is that it is a well-organized presentation of the authors' theory. The manuscript does not contain any data collection or analysis, so there are no strengths in terms of the quality of the data. However, the formalism used by the authors to present their ideas may be one of the greatest strengths. It is clear and easy to follow.

## Weaknesses

One weakness of this manuscript is that it does not provide a detailed description of how the FEP was developed or what evidence supports the theory. The authors describe the FEP as a "theory," but they do not present any empirical data to support their ideas. It may be possible to find some supporting data in other papers, but the lack of any data collection and analysis in this manuscript is a weakness.

## Recommendations

The authors' formalism and the clarity with which they describe their ideas are strengths of this manuscript. The manuscript does not contain any data collection or analysis, so there are no strengths in terms of the quality of the data. It would be helpful if the authors could provide more context for how the FEP was developed. If the authors' approach is a conceptual analysis, it may be helpful to provide some background information on previous work that has been done in this area.
