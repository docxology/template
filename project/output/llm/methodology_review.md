## Methodology Overview
The manuscript describes a study that uses a combination of statistical and machine learning techniques to analyze the performance of different optimization algorithms for deep learning. The authors first describe a set of benchmark problems, then compare the performance of the Adam algorithm with several other algorithms using a parameter sweep. The results are presented in a series of plots that show how the different algorithms perform on these benchmarks. Finally, the manuscript provides an analysis of the scalability and convergence properties of the different optimization algorithms.

## Research Design Assessment
The study is well-designed to answer its research question. In general, it follows best practices for comparing multiple optimization algorithms. The only concern I have is that the authors do not provide a clear description of how they determine which 10 optimization algorithms are the most important to compare and why these specific ones were chosen. As with any comparison study, it would be helpful to know whether there was an initial set of candidate methods and then a more systematic process (e.g., random sampling) used to select the top 10 from that list.

The authors do not discuss how they determine which optimization algorithms are the most important to compare.

## Strengths
The authors are careful in their description of the Adam algorithm. The paper also uses a clear and concise format for comparing the performance of different optimization algorithms. The use of a combination of statistical and machine learning techniques is well justified given the research question, as it allows the authors to compare multiple aspects of the performance of the different optimization algorithms.

## Weaknesses
The main weakness in this manuscript is that there are no data on the relative importance of the different algorithms. In general, I would like to know why these 10 algorithms were chosen and how they were selected from a larger set of candidate methods. The authors do not describe whether the Adam algorithm was compared with other optimization algorithms based on any specific criteria or if this was just a random sample of the top 10. This is not a major concern, but it would be helpful to know why these 10 particular ones were chosen.

This could be done by explaining why these 10 particular ones were chosen and how they were selected.

### References

The references are properly formatted with ISBNs, DOIs, and URLs. The only concern I have is that it would be helpful for the authors to provide a reference list in case readers want to look up any of the papers referenced in the manuscript. However, this is not a major concern.
