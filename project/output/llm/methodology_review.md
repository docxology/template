**Methodology Overview**

The authors of this paper provide a comprehensive framework for testing the performance of optimization algorithms with respect to two important criteria, scalability and convergence. The study is based on the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm which is widely used in deep learning. The SGD family includes Adam, RMSProp, Adagrad, AdaGrad, and AdamW. However, these methods are not well understood, and their relative performance is unclear. In this paper, the authors provide a systematic analysis of the SGD family by providing an upper bound for the convergence rate of each algorithm in the nonconvex setting and a lower bound for the convergence rate of each algorithm in the convex setting. The authors also show that the difference between the upper and lower bounds is exactly the computational complexity. The paper is well-organized and the methodology is novel, but it may be hard to understand without some background knowledge about optimization algorithms.

Abstract: The stochastic gradient descent (SGD) family includes Adam, RMSProp, Adagrad, AdaGrad, and AdamW. However, the relative performance of these algorithms is unclear in the nonconvex setting. In this paper, we show that the difference between the upper and lower bounds for the convergence rate of each algorithm in the convex setting is exactly the computational complexity, and therefore the SGD family can be ordered by their computational complexity. The ordering is $\text{AdaGrad} \succ\text{AdamW}\succ\text{Ada} \succ\text{Adagrad}\succ\text{RMSProp}$.

Keywords: stochastic gradient descent, nonconvex optimization, convergence rate, computational complexity
