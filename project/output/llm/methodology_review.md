### Methodology Overview

The manuscript is a comprehensive overview of the optimization algorithms for large-scale machine learning, with a focus on stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants. The authors provide an extensive review of the literature on SGD and its variants, including the theoretical analysis of the algorithm's convergence properties and the empirical performance of the different methods. The manuscript is well-organized and easy to follow.

### Research Design Assessment

The methodology used in this manuscript is a comprehensive literature review. The authors have reviewed a large number of papers on the topic of optimization algorithms for machine learning, with a focus on stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants. The manuscripts are organized by the type of algorithm, with an introduction to each section that provides context and background information. The methods used in this manuscript are not novel or innovative, but rather they are well-established and widely used in the field of machine learning.

### Strengths

The strengths of this methodology include:

    * The authors provide a comprehensive review of the literature on SGD and its variants.
    * The manuscripts are well-organized and easy to follow.
    * The manuscript is well-written, with clear headings and subheadings that help guide the reader through the different sections.

### Weaknesses

The weaknesses of this methodology include:

    * This is a review of existing literature. It does not present any new information or results.
    * The authors do not discuss the limitations of the methods they are reviewing, but rather provide an overview of the current state-of-the-art in the field.
    * The manuscript is very long and may be too long for some readers.

### Recommendations

The recommendations that could be made to this methodology include:

    * The authors should consider adding a summary or conclusions section that provides a brief overview of the main points from each of the different sections.
    * The manuscripts are very long. It would be helpful if the authors were able to provide an abstract for each manuscript, and then provide a list of the main points in the abstracts at the beginning of the manuscript.
