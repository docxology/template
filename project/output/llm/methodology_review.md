## Methodology Overview

The manuscript presents a comprehensive overview of optimization algorithms, with a focus on convex optimization techniques. The methodology is centered around the development and application of various optimization algorithms, including gradient descent, stochastic average gradient, and proximal algorithms. The authors provide a detailed description of each algorithm, along with their strengths and limitations.

## Research Design Assessment

The research design is primarily focused on theoretical developments and applications of optimization algorithms. The manuscript does not appear to involve any empirical studies or experiments. The authors' approach is largely descriptive, providing an in-depth analysis of the mathematical properties and computational efficiency of various optimization algorithms. While this approach provides a solid foundation for understanding the algorithms, it may limit the scope of the research.

## Strengths

One of the primary strengths of the manuscript is its comprehensive coverage of convex optimization techniques. The authors provide a detailed explanation of each algorithm, including their mathematical formulations, convergence properties, and computational efficiency. Additionally, the manuscript includes a thorough discussion of the strengths and limitations of each algorithm, which will be valuable for readers seeking to apply these techniques in practice.

## Weaknesses

One potential weakness of the manuscript is its lack of empirical validation. While the authors provide a detailed analysis of the theoretical properties of the algorithms, there is no experimental evidence to support their claims. This may limit the scope of the research and make it difficult for readers to evaluate the practical applicability of the algorithms.

## Recommendations

To strengthen the methodology, I recommend that the authors include empirical validation of the algorithms through experiments or simulations. This would provide additional evidence to support their claims and increase the confidence in the results. Additionally, the authors may consider including a comparison of the different optimization algorithms to demonstrate their relative strengths and limitations.
