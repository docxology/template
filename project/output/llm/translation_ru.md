## English Abstract


The manuscript "A Fast and Flexible Framework for Stochastic Optimization" by Brown et al. is an excellent piece of work that provides a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art in stochastic optimization. The authors present a new framework called "Stochastic Optimization with Adaptive Learning Rate (SOAR)" that can be used to solve a wide range of problems, including both convex and non-convex ones, and provide several theoretical results about its convergence. In this manuscript, the authors also implement SOAR on some classic stochastic optimization benchmarks and show that it outperforms many existing algorithms. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: (1) the authors present a new framework for solving stochastic problems with non-convex objectives; (2) they provide several theoretical results about the convergence of SOAR, including both the expected iteration complexity and the high-probability guarantee of its convergence; (3) they implement SOAR on some classic stochastic optimization benchmarks and show that it outperforms many existing algorithms. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: (1) the authors present a new framework for solving stochastic problems with non-convex objectives; (2) they provide several theoretical results about the convergence of SOAR, including both the expected iteration complexity and the high-probability guarantee of its convergence; (3) they implement SOAR on some classic stochastic optimization benchmarks and show that it outperforms many existing algorithms.
