## English Abstract

The paper presents a new method for solving the problem of adaptive subgradient optimization for stochastic convex composite functions. The main contribution is the development of an adaptive algorithm that converges to the optimal solution at a rate of O(1/t) in the sense of the expected value, which is better than the best known result of O(\sqrt{t}) for the case where the step size is set as 1/t. In this paper, we first propose a new adaptive subgradient algorithm that converges to the optimal solution at a rate of O(1/t) in the sense of the expected value and then provide an upper bound on the convergence rate of the algorithm. The proposed algorithm can be applied to any stochastic convex composite function with Lipschitz gradient. In particular, it is not necessary for the objective function to have a finite number of iterations as in some previous works. The key idea of the proposed adaptive subgradient method is to use an adaptive step size and to update the adaptive step size according to the gradient information. The new algorithm can be applied to any stochastic convex composite function with Lipschitz gradient, which includes the objective functions that are composed by a finite number of stochastic convex functions as in some previous works. In particular, the proposed method is not necessary for the objective function to have a finite number of iterations. The paper also provides an upper bound on the convergence rate of the algorithm.
