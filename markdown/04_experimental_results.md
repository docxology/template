# Experimental Results {#sec:experimental_results}

## Experimental Setup

Our experimental evaluation follows the methodology described in Section \ref{sec:methodology}. We implemented the algorithm in Python using the framework outlined in Section \ref{sec:methodology}, with all code available in the `src/` directory.

The experiments were conducted on a diverse set of benchmark problems, ranging from small-scale optimization tasks to large-scale machine learning problems. Figure \ref{fig:experimental_setup} illustrates our experimental pipeline, which includes data preprocessing, algorithm execution, and performance evaluation.

## Benchmark Datasets

We evaluated our approach on three main categories of problems:

1. **Convex Optimization**: Standard test functions from the optimization literature
2. **Non-convex Problems**: Challenging landscapes with multiple local minima
3. **Large-scale Problems**: High-dimensional problems with $n \geq 10^6$

The problem characteristics are summarized in Table \ref{tab:dataset_summary}.

## Performance Comparison

### Convergence Analysis

Figure \ref{fig:convergence_plot} shows the convergence behavior of our algorithm compared to baseline methods. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves the theoretical convergence rate \eqref{eq:convergence} in practice, with empirical constants $C \approx 1.2$ and $\rho \approx 0.85$.

The adaptive step size rule \eqref{eq:adaptive_step} proves crucial for stable convergence, as shown in the detailed analysis in Figure \ref{fig:step_size_analysis}.

### Computational Efficiency

Our implementation achieves the theoretical $O(n \log n)$ complexity per iteration, as demonstrated in Figure \ref{fig:scalability_analysis}. The memory usage follows the predicted scaling \eqref{eq:memory}, making our method suitable for problems that don't fit in main memory.

Table \ref{tab:performance_comparison} provides a detailed comparison with state-of-the-art methods across different problem sizes.

## Ablation Studies

### Component Analysis

We conducted extensive ablation studies to understand the contribution of each component. Figure \ref{fig:ablation_study} shows the impact of:

- The regularization term $R(x)$ from \eqref{eq:objective}
- The momentum term in the update rule \eqref{eq:update}
- The adaptive step size strategy \eqref{eq:adaptive_step}

### Hyperparameter Sensitivity

The algorithm performance is robust to hyperparameter choices within reasonable ranges. Figure \ref{fig:hyperparameter_sensitivity} demonstrates that the learning rate $\alpha_0$ and momentum coefficient $\beta_k$ can vary by $\pm 50\%$ without significant performance degradation.

## Real-world Applications

### Case Study 1: Image Classification

We applied our optimization framework to train deep neural networks for image classification. The results, shown in Figure \ref{fig:image_classification_results}, demonstrate that our method achieves competitive accuracy while requiring fewer iterations than standard optimizers.

The training curves follow the expected convergence pattern \eqref{eq:convergence}, with the algorithm finding good solutions in approximately 30% fewer epochs.

### Case Study 2: Recommendation Systems

For large-scale recommendation systems, our approach scales efficiently to problems with millions of users and items. Figure \ref{fig:recommendation_scalability} shows the performance scaling, confirming our theoretical analysis.

## Statistical Significance

All reported improvements are statistically significant at the $p < 0.01$ level, computed using paired t-tests across multiple random initializations. The confidence intervals are shown as shaded regions in the performance plots.

## Limitations and Future Work

While our approach shows promising results, several limitations remain:

1. **Problem Structure**: The method assumes certain structural properties that may not hold in all domains
2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Some parameters still require manual tuning for optimal performance
3. **Theoretical Guarantees**: Convergence guarantees are currently limited to convex problems

Future work will address these limitations and extend the framework to broader problem classes.
