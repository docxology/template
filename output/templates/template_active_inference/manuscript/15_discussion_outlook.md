# Limitations and outlook {#sec:discussion_outlook}

<!-- sheaf-track:prose -->

## Limitations

The Bernoulli–Ising toy, T-maze harness, and sheaf composition model are pedagogical. They validate analytical consistency, artifact wiring, renderer dispatch, and manuscript hydration—not empirical claims about biological agents. Default pymdp mode is `state_inference` with planning horizon 2; the policy-comparison artifact exposes policy-inference rows without changing the default rollout ([@sec:methods_pymdp]).

## Sheaf audit and outlook

[@sec:sheaf_coverage] and [@sec:appendix_full_sheaf] make binding state auditable under strict compose validation ([@sec:methods_sheaf]). Pipeline extensions in `tracks.yaml` `extension_tracks` now write deterministic artifacts: a belief GIF via `render_animation.py` and graph-world SI summary/trace via `simulate_si_graph_world.py`. The appendix row already binds an `animation` sheaf fragment without new manifest rows.

Sweep RMSE 0 nats and SI goal reached 1 summarize measured agreement on the declared grids and rollout. Future work includes full expected-free-energy policy selection, richer graph-world rollouts, and expanded Lean proofs beyond the boundary witnesses in [@sec:methods_lean].

The discussion ontology binds `coverage_semantics` to the audit matrix in [@sec:sheaf_coverage], `pedagogical_scope` to the non-empirical scope of the toy models, and `state_inference_mode` to the pymdp harness contract in [@sec:methods_pymdp].

<!-- sheaf-track:simulation -->

Measured pymdp rollout (`state_inference`, config hash `ea4b126a9c22f22f`): mean belief entropy 0.3251 nats over 2 steps; goal reached flag 1; action diversity 2.

Analytical sweep residual RMSE 0 nats (max residual 0). Coverage audit: 53 present / 53 bound / 0 missing cells on the IMRAD matrix.
