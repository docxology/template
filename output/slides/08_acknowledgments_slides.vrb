We gratefully acknowledge the contributions that made this research
possible.

\begin{block}{Primary Source}
\protect\phantomsection\label{primary-source}
This research is based entirely on the philosophical work of
\textbf{Andrius Kulikauskas}, who developed the ``Ways of Figuring
Things Out'' framework and documented 284 ways of knowledge acquisition.
The framework, database, and documentation are the result of his
extensive philosophical work conducted in 2010-2011.
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Data Availability}
\protect\phantomsection\label{data-availability}
All data used in this research is in the \textbf{Public Domain} as
stated in the source documentation. The MySQL database dump and text
documentation (\texttt{ways.md}) are publicly available and were used
with appropriate attribution.
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Framework Development}
\protect\phantomsection\label{framework-development}
The House of Knowledge framework, the 24-room structure, and the
dialogue type classifications are all part of Andrius Kulikauskas's
original philosophical work. This research provides systematic
documentation and analysis but does not claim to have developed the
underlying framework.
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Technical Infrastructure}
\protect\phantomsection\label{technical-infrastructure}
This research builds upon:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Python scientific computing stack} (NumPy, SciPy, Pandas,
  NetworkX, Matplotlib)
\item
  \textbf{SQLite} database system for data storage and querying
\item
  \textbf{LaTeX and Pandoc} for document preparation
\item
  \textbf{Open-source tools} for data analysis and visualization
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Research Context}
\protect\phantomsection\label{research-context}
This work contributes to the systematic documentation and analysis of
philosophical frameworks, demonstrating how quantitative methods can
complement qualitative understanding. The integration of database
analysis, network analysis, and statistical methods with philosophical
interpretation represents a methodological contribution to the study of
knowledge systems.
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Future Contributions}
\protect\phantomsection\label{future-contributions}
Future researchers building on this work should acknowledge: - Andrius
Kulikauskas as the originator of the Ways framework - The public domain
status of the source data - The systematic analysis and documentation
provided by this research
