\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

\begin{frame}{Purpose and Scope}
\protect\phantomsection\label{purpose-and-scope}
This manuscript presents \textbf{Containment Theory}---a computationally
verified alternative foundation to classical Set Theory for discrete
mathematics. We develop a complete computational framework for boundary
logic (also called the calculus of indications), demonstrating its
equivalence to Boolean algebra while offering distinct advantages in
axiomatic economy, geometric intuition, and handling of self-reference.
Our primary contribution is rigorous computational verification of all
theoretical claims in G. Spencer-Brown's \emph{Laws of Form} (1969),
establishing Containment Theory as a viable alternative foundation with
only two axioms compared to Set Theory's nine or more.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The Foundation Problem}
\protect\phantomsection\label{the-foundation-problem}
Mathematics rests upon foundations, and for over a century, Set Theory
has served as the dominant foundation for mathematical reasoning. The
Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms with Choice (ZFC) provide the standard framework
within which most mathematics is constructed \cite{kunen1980}. Yet this
foundation carries significant conceptual weight: nine or more axioms,
including the axiom of infinity, axiom of choice, and carefully crafted
restrictions to avoid paradoxes like Russell's.

In 1969, G. Spencer-Brown proposed a radical alternative in \emph{Laws
of Form} \cite{spencerbrown1969}: a calculus requiring only two axioms,
built on the primitive notion of \textbf{distinction} (the act of
separating inside from outside, this from that) rather than membership.
This calculus---variously called \textbf{boundary logic}, the
\textbf{calculus of indications}, or \textbf{Containment
Theory}---offers a foundation of remarkable parsimony while maintaining
complete equivalence to Boolean algebra \cite{huntington1904,stone1936}
and propositional logic.

\textbf{Containment Theory} is our term for this approach to
mathematical foundations using spatial containment (boundaries) rather
than set membership. \textbf{Boundary logic} refers to the logical
system built from boundary distinctions, while the \textbf{calculus of
indications} is Spencer-Brown's original name for the formal system.
Throughout this manuscript, we use these terms interchangeably to refer
to Spencer-Brown's system.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Historical Context}
\protect\phantomsection\label{historical-context}
\begin{block}{Spencer-Brown's Laws of Form (1969)}
\protect\phantomsection\label{spencer-browns-laws-of-form-1969}
George Spencer-Brown developed the calculus of indications from a simple
observation: the most fundamental cognitive act is \textbf{making a
distinction}---separating inside from outside, this from that
\cite{spencerbrown1969}. A \textbf{distinction} is the act of drawing a
boundary that creates two regions: an inside and an outside. The
\emph{mark} or \emph{cross}, written \(\langle\ \rangle\), represents
this primary distinction: it creates a boundary that distinguishes the
space inside from the space outside. This insight aligns with cybernetic
thinking about observation and distinction
\cite{bateson1972,vonfoerster1981}.

From this single primitive, Spencer-Brown derived two axioms:

\begin{enumerate}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{The Law of Calling} (Involution):
  \(\langle\langle a \rangle\rangle = a\)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Crossing a boundary twice returns to the original state
  \item
    Equivalent to double negation elimination
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{The Law of Crossing} (Condensation):
  \(\langle\ \rangle\langle\ \rangle = \langle\ \rangle\)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Two marks condense to one mark
  \item
    The marked state is idempotent
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

These axioms generate the complete Boolean algebra, yet their
interpretation is fundamentally spatial rather than membership-based.
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Kauffman's Extensions}
\protect\phantomsection\label{kauffmans-extensions}
Louis H. Kauffman extended Spencer-Brown's work in several directions
\cite{kauffman2001,kauffman2005}, connecting it to knot theory,
recursive forms, and category theory. Kauffman demonstrated that the
calculus of indications provides a natural notation for Boolean algebra
and showed how self-referential forms---equations like
\(f = \langle f \rangle\)---lead to ``imaginary'' Boolean values
analogous to \(\sqrt{-1}\) in complex numbers.

These imaginary values oscillate between marked and unmarked states,
providing a formal treatment of self-reference that avoids the paradoxes
plaguing naive set theory. Where Russell's paradox forces set theory to
carefully restrict comprehension, boundary logic incorporates
self-reference naturally.
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Bricken's Computational Boundary Mathematics}
\protect\phantomsection\label{brickens-computational-boundary-mathematics}
William Bricken developed boundary logic into a practical computational
framework \cite{bricken2019,bricken2021}, demonstrating that forms
translate directly to logic circuits (NAND is universal and corresponds
to \(\langle ab \rangle\)) \cite{micheli1994} and that the calculus
provides an efficient representation for Boolean reasoning.

Bricken's ``iconic arithmetic'' extends the notation to numerical
computation, suggesting that boundary representations may offer
advantages beyond Boolean logic.
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Motivation for This Work}
\protect\phantomsection\label{motivation-for-this-work}
Despite its theoretical elegance, Containment Theory remains
underexplored in mainstream mathematics and computer science. While
Spencer-Brown's original work and subsequent extensions by Kauffman and
Bricken provide compelling theoretical foundations, there has been
limited computational verification of the claims and systematic
comparison with established foundations like Set Theory. This work
addresses these gaps by:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  \textbf{Providing rigorous computational verification} of all
  theoretical claims in Laws of Form, including both axioms and all nine
  derived consequences, through a complete implementation with
  comprehensive test coverage
\item
  \textbf{Establishing precise correspondence} between boundary logic
  and Boolean algebra through systematic verification of De Morgan's
  laws, Boolean axioms, and truth table equivalence
\item
  \textbf{Analyzing complexity properties} of the reduction algorithm,
  demonstrating polynomial-time termination and providing empirical
  complexity metrics for various form patterns
\item
  \textbf{Comparing foundational properties} with Set Theory
  systematically across multiple dimensions: axiomatic economy,
  expressiveness, self-reference handling, and geometric interpretation
\item
  \textbf{Creating accessible tools} for exploring and verifying
  boundary logic, including a complete Python implementation,
  visualization capabilities, and comprehensive documentation
\end{enumerate}

These contributions collectively establish Containment Theory as a
computationally verified alternative foundation for discrete
mathematics, with clear advantages in parsimony and geometric intuition
while maintaining full Boolean completeness.

theoretical foundations, computational verification, and broader
implications of Containment Theory:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Methodology} (Section 3): Provides the formal definition of
  the calculus of indications, including the two fundamental axioms
  (Calling and Crossing), the reduction algorithm for transforming forms
  to canonical representations, and the precise correspondence between
  boundary logic and Boolean algebra. Readers will find complete
  definitions of all technical terms, including forms, enclosures,
  juxtapositions, and canonical forms.
\item
  \textbf{Experimental Results} (Section 4): Presents comprehensive
  computational verification of all theoretical claims, including
  verification of both axioms, all nine derived consequences (C1-C9)
  from Laws of Form, De Morgan's laws, and fundamental Boolean axioms.
  This section also includes complexity analysis demonstrating
  polynomial-time reduction for ground forms and test coverage metrics
  confirming the reliability of the implementation.
\item
  \textbf{Discussion} (Section 5): Compares Containment Theory with
  classical Set Theory across multiple dimensions---axiomatic economy,
  expressiveness, self-reference handling, and geometric intuition. The
  section also explores theoretical implications for foundations of
  mathematics, connections to cognitive science and active inference
  frameworks, and potential applications in circuit design and formal
  verification.
\item
  \textbf{Conclusion} (Section 6): Summarizes the key contributions of
  this work, including the computational framework, formal verification
  results, complexity analysis, and comparative analysis with Set
  Theory. The section also outlines future research directions,
  including extensions to predicate logic, arithmetic integration, and
  applications in quantum computing and neural networks.
\item
  \textbf{Literature Review} (Section 7): Provides comprehensive
  coverage of foundational works (Spencer-Brown, Kauffman, Bricken),
  related formal systems (Set Theory, Boolean algebra, category theory),
  and connections to variational inference frameworks and cognitive
  science.
\item

  methodological details, additional experimental results, philosophical
  foundations (pragmatist and neo-materialist perspectives), and
  application examples across multiple domains.
\end{itemize}
