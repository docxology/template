## Executive Summary

This research presents a novel optimization framework designed to achieve both theoretical convergence guarantees and practical performance across a diverse range of problems. The framework’s core contribution lies in its adaptive step size strategy, coupled with momentum, enabling rapid convergence and robust performance, as demonstrated by empirical results matching theoretical predictions. Specifically, the algorithm achieves a linear convergence rate with a rate of (0, 1) under convex conditions, alongside O(n log n) per-iteration complexity, offering a significant advantage over traditional methods. The framework’s modular design, incorporating features such as a markdown-to-pdf pipeline, test-driven development, and automated quality validation, ensures reproducibility and facilitates seamless integration into existing workflows. The experimental evaluation, conducted across benchmark datasets, demonstrates a 23.7% improvement in performance compared to state-of-the-art methods (Section 4.3.1). This work represents a substantial advancement in optimization theory and practice, offering a robust and scalable solution for complex optimization problems (Section 2.3.1). Future research directions include extending the theoretical guarantees to non-convex problems and exploring multi-objective optimization scenarios (Section 5.4.1).  The framework’s ability to scale to large-scale problems, as evidenced by the linear memory scaling (Section 3.4), makes it particularly well-suited for applications in machine learning and computational science (Section 5.1.1).  The combination of theoretical rigor and practical implementation makes this framework a valuable addition to the optimization landscape. (Section 2.2).
