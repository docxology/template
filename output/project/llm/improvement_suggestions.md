Okay, here’s a detailed review of the manuscript, structured according to your requirements.

## Summary

The manuscript presents a novel optimization framework combining theoretical rigor with practical efficiency. The core innovation lies in a unified approach combining regularization, adaptive step sizes, and momentum techniques. While the framework demonstrates promising convergence properties and scalability, several areas require refinement. Specifically, the documentation lacks sufficient detail regarding the adaptive step size strategy, the implementation details of the momentum term, and the justification for the chosen hyperparameters. Furthermore, the experimental results could benefit from a more thorough analysis of the convergence rate and a more robust comparison with state-of-the-art methods. The manuscript’s overall structure and clarity could be improved to enhance its accessibility and impact.

## High Priority Improvements

The most critical issues relate to the lack of detail concerning the adaptive step size strategy (Section 3.3) and the momentum term. The manuscript states that the adaptive step size dynamically adjusts based on gradient history, but it doesn’t fully explain the formula used or the rationale behind it.  *WHAT*: The mechanism for adaptive step size is insufficiently described. *WHY*: This is fundamental to the algorithm's performance and stability. *HOW*: The manuscript should provide the exact formula for calculating the step size and a detailed explanation of the convergence guarantees associated with this strategy.  Similarly, the momentum term (Section 3.3) is treated as a black box. The manuscript needs to clarify how the momentum coefficient is calculated and how it contributes to faster convergence. *WHAT*: The momentum term’s implementation is unclear. *WHY*: Without understanding the momentum’s role, it’s difficult to assess its eﬃciency and potential issues. *HOW*: The manuscript should provide the formula for calculating the momentum update and discuss its impact on convergence speed and stability.  Finally, the experimental results require a more rigorous comparison with state-of-the-art methods. While the manuscript claims superior performance, it lacks a detailed analysis of the convergence rate and a more robust comparison with established optimization algorithms. *WHAT*: The comparison with existing methods is weak. *WHY*: A thorough comparison is crucial for validating the framework’s advantages. *HOW*: The manuscript should include a more detailed analysis of the convergence rate and a comparative evaluation of the framework’s performance against well-known optimization methods.

## Medium Priority Improvements

The manuscript’s structure and clarity could be improved. The sections are logically organized, but the level of detail within each section could be enhanced. Specifically, the documentation of the data preprocessing steps (Section 4.1) needs to be expanded to provide a more complete understanding of the data preparation process. *WHAT*: The documentation of data preprocessing is incomplete. *WHY*: This impacts reproducibility and understanding of the experimental setup. *HOW*: The manuscript should provide a more detailed description of the data preprocessing steps, including the normalization method used and the rationale behind it.  The description of the experimental setup (Section 4.1) also needs to be clarified, particularly regarding the benchmark datasets used. *WHAT*: The benchmark datasets are not fully described. *WHY*: This limits the ability to reproduce and extend the experiments. *HOW*: The manuscript should provide a more detailed description of the benchmark datasets, including their size, dimensionality, and characteristics.  Furthermore, the manuscript could benefit from a more formal definition of the convergence metrics used in the analysis (Section 4.3). *WHAT*: The convergence metrics are not clearly defined. *WHY*: This makes it difficult to assess the significance of the results. *HOW*: The manuscript should provide a formal definition of the convergence metrics used, including their units and the rationale behind their selection.

## Low Priority Improvements

The manuscript’s overall formatting could be improved. The use of Markdown is generally well-executed, but some sections could benefit from more consistent formatting. *WHAT*: Formatting inconsistencies exist. *WHY*: This detracts from the overall readability and professionalism of the manuscript. *HOW*: The manuscript should be reviewed for consistency in formatting, including the use of headings, bullet points, and spacing.  The inclusion of a glossary of terms (not present) would also enhance clarity.

## Overall Recommendation

**Accept with Major Revisions**

The framework presented demonstrates a promising approach to optimization, but significant revisions are required to address the identified shortcomings. The lack of detail regarding the adaptive step size strategy and momentum term, coupled with a weak comparison with state-of-the-art methods, necessitates major revisions before the manuscript can be considered for publication. Addressing these issues will substantially strengthen the manuscript’s theoretical foundation, experimental validation, and overall impact.
