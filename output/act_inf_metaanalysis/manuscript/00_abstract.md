# Abstract

The Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference have expanded rapidly across neuroscience, robotics, biology, and formal mathematics. However, the field lacks systematic methods for tracking which of its central theoretical claims are well-supported, contested, or merely assumed. Building on the systematic literature analysis of Knight, Cordes, and Friedman \citep{knight2022fep}—which pioneered manual annotation paired with ontology-based analysis at the scale of hundreds of papers—we present a computational meta-analysis framework that automates and scales this approach. Our pipeline retrieves literature from arXiv, Semantic Scholar, and OpenAlex, deduplicating records via a canonical identifier hierarchy. It classifies papers into a three-tier taxonomy spanning eight categories: A (Core Theory), B (Tools \& Translation), and C (Application Domains). To transcend keyword matching, an LLM-powered extraction system evaluates each abstract against eight core hypotheses, producing structured nanopublications with directionality, confidence scores, and natural-language reasoning. These nanopublications populate an RDF-compatible knowledge graph evaluated by a citation-weighted evidence scoring function.

Applied to a corpus of $N = 1208$ papers (spanning 1972–2026), the framework details a field dominated by core theory (Domain A) but actively diversifying into tools development (Domain B) and specific applications (Domain C), notably neuroscience, robotics, and computational psychiatry. Non-negative matrix factorization identifies five latent topics that cross-cut the keyword domain taxonomy, while citation network analysis reveals a sparse yet structured graph (2{,}780 intra-corpus edges, 6.1\% reference resolution) anchored by pronounced hub papers. By demonstrating that automated LLM-driven assertion extraction can generate scalable, queryable representations of scientific evidence, this work provides a robust architectural foundation for *living literature reviews*—continuously updated knowledge graphs that track the trajectory of theoretical consensus across rapidly evolving fields, within Active Inference and beyond.
