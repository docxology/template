{"title": "Service Orchestration in the Computing Continuum: Structural Challenges and Vision", "abstract": "The Computing Continuum (CC) integrates different layers of processing infrastructure, from Edge to Cloud, to optimize service quality through ubiquitous and reliable computation. Compared to central architectures, however, heterogeneous and dynamic infrastructure increases the complexity for service orchestration. To guide research, this article first summarizes structural problems of the CC, and then, envisions an ideal solution for autonomous service orchestration across the CC. As one instantiation, we show how Active Inference, a concept from neuroscience, can support self-organizing services in continuously interpreting their environment to optimize service quality. Still, we conclude that no existing solution achieves our vision, but that research on service orchestration faces several structural challenges. Most notably: provide standardized simulation and evaluation environments for comparing the performance of orchestration mechanisms. Together, the challenges outline a research roadmap toward resilient and scalable service orchestration in the CC.", "authors": [{"name": "Boris Sedlak", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Víctor Casamayor Pujol", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Ildefons Magrans de Abril", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Praveen Kumar Donta", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Adel N.

{"title": "BRAIN: Bayesian Reasoning via Active Inference for Agentic and Embodied Intelligence in Mobile Networks", "abstract": "Future sixth-generation (6G) mobile networks will demand artificial intelligence (AI) agents that are not only autonomous and efficient, but also capable of real-time adaptation in dynamic environments and transparent in their decisionmaking. However, prevailing agentic AI approaches in networking, exhibit significant shortcomings in this regard. Conventional deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based agents lack explainability and often suffer from brittle adaptation, including catastrophic forgetting of past knowledge under non-stationary conditions. In this paper, we propose an alternative solution for these challenges: Bayesian reasoning via Active Inference (BRAIN) agent. BRAIN harnesses a deep generative model of the network environment and minimizes variational free energy to unify perception and action in a single closed-loop paradigm. We implement BRAIN as O-RAN eXtended application (xApp) on GPU-accelerated testbed and demonstrate its advantages over standard DRL baselines. In our experiments, BRAIN exhibits (i) robust causal reasoning for dynamic radio resource allocation, maintaining slice-specific quality of service (QoS) targets (throughput, latency, reliability) under varying traffic loads, (ii) superior adaptability with up to 28.3% higher robustness to sudden traffic shifts versus benchmarks (achieved without any retraining), and (iii) real-time interpretability of its decisions through human-interpretable belief state diagnostics.", "authors": [{"name": "Osman Tugay Basaran", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Martin Maier", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Falko Dressler", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2026, "doi": null, "arxiv_id": "2602.14033", "s2_id": "c072cd247c21cb4e1ee483e351ab4d5cca68700d", "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": ["s2:0fbd78449a41193a5d85b4624d18941c3a156c16", "s2:ea2dd0a6db65d5ccc5c7f8c5a56e0c600a2aa5b2", "s2:df308217f36e702581bde5b2bab712c9b4f8f4bf", "s2:572b698848654336de6aa8e2d97f84e82bb1b781", "s2:449f075d54ba263b70978ccb674779b312ef1316", "s2:3b28239f6642e6416e12878a6e522c547c72298b", "s2:9b43e683a2b5e28518bac17c3267aab376aaa111", "s2:4d64f3d18a7c027114c073cfd3de990d6529a0ef", "s2:61af8eb39f1cfaf3726f1cbba89df80b5d14046d", "s2:b893044d157c2516f5b39e449be2af991b61813b", "s2:f582b12f17cb89f8071bc183f83961456df4e2b9", "s2:07f39f7a376d58b3b1d04841dea4741f5909a72a", "s2:cc46815ca9873ae126a937977a890767549ddffd", "s2:5642c14759c398fa65692872fa862d2c643984d5", "s2:ae192cb0396c644f0dc72c8f94cea4a93c37c60c", "s2:d25acb05d3e1cd9170709ce8685706f31fa88695", "s2:bb01d7be9b49c8a018e134c7f132c39b7d9973ad", "s2:3e8fc7f9bc7ff938e3b8f557990cc1986b11a18e", "s2:a60db7cd16f286b7511faef337a07e819295712f", "s2:8ee4bc1034b5746459496e660b6df0489f66f296", "s2:68e789e2db903df116410b07674e1bfa5285de30", "s2:b65ad2308b6e3085aa975484619c0957597451bc", "s2:2197f3c2270f267e5e37d0e3e51979d1304cf9dd", "s2:2b497b30a68ae8d807dbf268350e051594658e6e", "s2:b5e2e223fb5f85e97a7df1e6e4a01540b6953fb7", "s2:d17c6cb9c0d8ec64ce8d1eff653ac72b15df683a", "s2:a934a3a7f171d494556a80d31f7bf4b637376c71", "s2:98929800f75790c41e1c88e5f613c3c9412fac6f", "s2:dce6f9d4017b1785979e7520fd0834ef8cf02f4b", "s2:442e10a3c6640ded9408622005e3c2a8906ce4c2", "s2:c0883f5930a232a9c1ad601c978caede29155979", "s2:3b9732bb07dc99bde5e1f9f75251c6ea5039373e", "s2:2319a491378867c7049b3da055c5df60e1671158", "s2:1ed6a4a10589618d4f26350f1a296ee767ceff6b", "s2:e08aa490210d2838de9c0903fccede2c4a563029", "s2:563e821bb5ea825efb56b77484f5287f08cf3753", "s2:ec97d1c8f9f5ce60c86fcdb511861df3928ad4b3", "s2:833bd1a06db46849773d43346c4e3e21bd32c717", "s2:4b7cdfffcda9f9b4687aa921453127bd5c5fffa4", "s2:4f1046f538fac7b9181b1c27a66223d7d031da7b", "s2:4c915c1eecb217c123a36dc6d3ce52d12c742614"], "publication_date": null}

Moreover, they intervene only at action decoding while keeping visual representations fixed-insufficient under perceptual ambiguity, where reconsidering how to perceive is as important as deciding what to do. To address these limitations, we propose SCALE, a simple inference strategy that jointly modulates visual perception and action based on 'self-uncertainty', inspired by uncertainty-driven exploration in Active Inference theory-requiring no additional training, no verifier, and only a single forward pass.

{"title": "Schema-based active inference supports rapid generalization of experience and frontal cortical coding of abstract structure", "abstract": "Schemas -- abstract relational structures that capture the commonalities across experiences -- are thought to underlie humans' and animals' ability to rapidly generalize knowledge, rebind new experiences to existing structures, and flexibly adapt behavior across contexts. Despite their central role in cognition, the computational principles and neural mechanisms supporting schema formation and use remain elusive. Here, we introduce schema-based hierarchical active inference (S-HAI), a novel computational framework that combines predictive processing and active inference with schema-based mechanisms. In S-HAI, a higher-level generative model encodes abstract task structure, while a lower-level model encodes spatial navigation, with the two levels linked by a grounding likelihood that maps abstract goals to physical locations. Through a series of simulations, we show that S-HAI reproduces key behavioral signatures of rapid schema-based generalization in spatial navigation tasks, including the ability to flexibly remap abstract schemas onto novel contexts, resolve goal ambiguity, and balance reuse versus accommodation of novel mappings. Crucially, S-HAI also reproduces prominent neural codes reported in rodent medial prefrontal cortex during a schema-dependent navigation and decision task, including task-invariant goal-progress cells, goal-identity cells, and goal-and-spatially conjunctive cells, as well as place-like codes at the lower level. Taken together, these results provide a mechanistic account of schema-based learning and inference that bridges behavior, neural data, and theory.

{"title": "Active inference and artificial reasoning", "abstract": "This technical note considers the sampling of outcomes that provide the greatest amount of information about the structure of underlying world models. This generalisation furnishes a principled approach to structure learning under a plausible set of generative models or hypotheses. In active inference, policies - i.e., combinations of actions - are selected based on their expected free energy, which comprises expected information gain and value. Information gain corresponds to the KL divergence between predictive posteriors with, and without, the consequences of action. Posteriors over models can be evaluated quickly and efficiently using Bayesian Model Reduction, based upon accumulated posterior beliefs about model parameters. The ensuing information gain can then be used to select actions that disambiguate among alternative models, in the spirit of optimal experimental design.

{"title": "Gravity Prior and Temporal Horizon Shape Interceptive Behavior under Active Inference", "abstract": "Accurate interception of moving objects, such as catching a ball, requires the nervous system to overcome sensory delays, noise, and environmental dynamics. One key challenge is predicting future object motion in the presence of sensory uncertainty and inherent neural processing latencies. Theoretical frameworks such as internal models and optimal control have emphasized the role of predictive mechanisms in motor behavior. Active Inference extends these ideas by positing that perception and action arise from minimizing variational free energy under a generative model of the world. In this study, we investigate how different predictive strategies and the inclusion of environmental dynamics, specifically an internal model of gravity, influence interceptive control within an Active Inference agent. We simulate a simplified ball-catching task in which the agent moves a cursor horizontally to intercept a parabolically falling object. Four strategies are compared: short temporal horizon prediction of the next position or long horizon estimation of the interception point, each with or without a gravity prior. Performance is evaluated across diverse initial conditions using spatial and temporal error, action magnitude, and movement corrections. All strategies produce successful interception behavior, but those that incorporate gravity and longer temporal horizons outperform others. Including a gravity prior significantly improves spatial and temporal accuracy. Predicting the future interception point yields lower action values and smoother trajectories compared to short-horizon prediction. These findings suggest that internal models of physical dynamics and extended predictive horizons can enhance interceptive control, providing a unified computational account of how the brain may integrate sensory uncertainty, physical expectations, and motor planning.", "authors": [{"name": "Marta Russo", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Antonella Maselli", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Federico Maggiore", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Giovanni Pezzulo", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2025, "doi": null, "arxiv_id": "2512.17735", "s2_id": "72575de0d1e3035d52777aad483dd18253c03420", "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": ["s2:23682256519b2bf01adfff7f7af45ace3e297b76", "s2:a6fb718bb9e1debb19cf8cc10686f5e7c90bc56c", "s2:36d8278ffaa7b80165920c928bd87e87f957f3ba", "s2:ac79c05a33598529ce2a1d04ffbf2f3314a305a4", "s2:9e791c5e340c8fa461f7b114426b723b5e32ab37", "s2:19734e2399ff2b2f3c40470b38f4a7320203a4a3", "s2:231cf4fa12adf40c3cc2c9345c3bd6dba69c4e1f", "s2:5d630f5270c6de5b749bbf137b5e139d3c04acf3", "s2:a1140fc86e8bda453b6ad1f7cce95650cfa4a415", "s2:7d7c67c1f39b99d25a3498d134b7fb678d70f0bf", "s2:6f48e8d5ab7eb85834c13fb9866943ca2b8cc668", "s2:dded71d2681fb42c1d149286b636b066ab6a0910", "s2:9ff18d233397e8d683dac3336e6cecc5f48c3566", "s2:35f6f6ce7ba3228634f2f084c26213067b80976f", "s2:c3829409915c802108c329a22598bee2924cecee", "s2:ba5a1cbf7f4ed8ba5cf2a6f4115688cd0c825a96", "s2:e383a0f98251b9eda0ea6408543b9194b6f60b9f", "s2:f02a946a3c6f3020fb80cf585a6933723e8c459a", "s2:f5a5f07795dca90cf97449e955c23eb514809041", "s2:df0bcd76bf0342cfa1cfe7b0c319bdc90f9a84d5", "s2:b88b4e478908998520f7f6448971e8ac1f664c73", "s2:74a4a19ff902adb458989048ddb13b5570bf117f", "s2:010ac161d50b4e64bd0873cd554fdb33f7686258", "s2:6faedead39294ac0a5fdf053d27e991a107914fb", "s2:a727b0d6fe97696da72be28725f47a2d3cdd09cd", "s2:2197f3c2270f267e5e37d0e3e51979d1304cf9dd", "s2:16aef42d9b453dad02a7aba750825bcb6e049bc1", "s2:4634c04db086d3152d9589529631138ace4429e6", "s2:207ee7167576465c451c8c85c84575dcb6120bc1", "s2:c8f10feee23573f3f5c80293baf35f8ebe880385", "s2:5e7015b2589008b6db124019d4ca1d36ce1fa555", "s2:a2faf93c3dc4ccb8b83f4888ff9a3b7d32319b12", "s2:0f1440184094a1fc3483fbc2d36eae2e1c88851d", "s2:3e74ec52fd3d1ef93e9ae1bea177a92aca8fc9f7", "s2:0eeaf89665aad3648c177e737b7eabb3a988f0cb", "s2:754b657330b1674d3453e8254d3a664db5222b3b", "s2:b52b79c74f9a95c52ff30588206372f5f5e26e7d", "s2:0de7d3def20ea1d1a84f7e1de68463a509971b7d", "s2:a761ccb6ab644afb86276a255b5346a933359f15", "s2:ad4299ea75124c33d2e78ee07b671ff527362a6e", "s2:17b7e0b33847ca1c0546f714b75bdd768263b267", "s2:733af3988e0fa3801bdf9ef6cb91216671362bfb", "s2:00dcd4afe240dabb2fb3ddddd44d4dc24799cbcf", "s2:b39915112b09fa3b93c029043ac3d7564f74a3e9", "s2:1f8cacb7efb11f4421d899162234da079301b0f3", "s2:485b6ae6c0429e22996165d16ed9242fc8193add", "s2:22ff44176f7646290a7b40628b4d85056ef007ed", "s2:fc91ba123a8242ed3b3ed7633b46204defa166b2", "s2:407bb3034daac0fb4fba3d4c09ef3a26dfbfcf5f", "s2:8e5eda285b30216bc5f5ca93d3a93728c15852f8", "s2:df2eb2c000bfb0b750d77841b783d0c14504538e", "s2:05a9b7477d97ef74094474d634c18ee8607d2acd", "s2:345e85f5d419f5277a250bf4c65b3144f020c1c2", "s2:5fe5278bc64d19c470be9ad3eb65831afac3dfac", "s2:57ffbcbd98565f0b3a05cad7266922da3e10c312", "s2:2c5d71a3365e751aed7241b2bd0a9587cabfaa4a", "s2:5eba92dd285d71b6278dc67715dc48a4aa946679", "s2:3b7140070314a0b707ef04a2b1b9857c42bcca4f", "s2:9d1d39552bb244a91633d7c9b3261880d0b0cd60", "s2:8051ecdd0954a842ce92c5ff0079cb06e31df4f7", "s2:b49fb6f99b25bf2c1f713fb9d3d61ca59e058453", "s2:592b63775efdf758fa1042a19f68889180fe9b68", "s2:170438cf3438c21124dbc05df33ae0d10847c3af", "s2:c8d4f641b3461709eb2d1c720818de255aa187e7", "s2:b9b98d3c08fcc6e1c7ad460cd0a95f5feeba5e7b", "s2:1001d6d0bc061fbbd6ef8a88de1da98ca91c563d", "s2:ae56eb544ee9c8b3499441617f93b3c2c9b0e05e", "s2:24cee2bfa372e01f8276111c41b82ad06de07500", "s2:5cd70278d4917e4d358321574da50a2cff3e190a", "s2:a4d17c5cefd63140ebdd2e008b09e340af2fbab9", "s2:e7b69b12b8a80ca139e0d99f31eb9fee02d5b872", "s2:40598312eaa21e5136f3aeb97383e3334c1c174f", "s2:5aadd0235cde4ba4f10c82f7903a3f49913579ee", "s2:9a0b35871bbe9afa94e50b3986ffe190833b22e3", "s2:329705a255360c8f86a10d909a92794ed8a0857a"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Gaussian Process Dual MPC using Active Inference: An Autonomous Vehicle Usecase", "abstract": "Designing controllers under uncertainty requires balancing the need to explore system dynamics with the requirement to maintain reliable control performance. Dual control addresses this challenge by selecting actions that both regulate the system and actively gather informative data. This paper investigates the use of the Active Inference framework, grounded in the Free Energy Principle, for developing a dual model-predictive controller (MPC). To identify and quantify uncertainty, we introduce an online sparse semi-parametric Gaussian Process model that combines the flexibility of nonparametric with the efficiency of parametric learning for real-time updates. By applying the expected free energy functional to this adaptive probabilistic model, we derive an MPC objective that incorporates an information-theoretic term, which captures uncertainty arising from both the learned model and measurement noise. This formulation leads to a stochastic optimal control problem for dual controller design, which is solved using a novel dynamic-programming-based method. Simulation results on a vehicle use case demonstrate that the proposed algorithm enhances autonomous driving control performance across different settings and scenarios.", "authors": [{"name": "Mohammad Mahmoudi Filabadi", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "G.

For example, a household might wish to reduce energy costs and grid-associated greenhouse gas emissions, yet keep room temperatures comfortable. Another challenge is that an intelligent HEMS agent must make decisions under uncertainty. An agent must plan actions into the future, but weather and solar generation forecasts, for example, provide inherently uncertain estimates of future conditions.

{"title": "Active Inference with Reusable State-Dependent Value Profiles", "abstract": "Adaptive behavior in volatile environments requires agents to switch among value-control regimes across latent contexts, but maintaining separate preferences, policy biases, and action-confidence parameters for every situation is intractable. We introduce value profiles: a small set of reusable bundles of value-related parameters (outcome preferences, policy priors, and policy precision) assigned to hidden states in a generative model. As posterior beliefs over states evolve trial by trial, effective control parameters arise via belief-weighted mixing, enabling state-conditional strategy recruitment without requiring independent parameters for each context. We evaluate this framework in probabilistic reversal learning, comparing static-precision, entropy-coupled dynamic-precision, and profile-based models using cross-validated log-likelihood and information criteria. Model comparison favors the profile-based model over simpler alternatives (about 100-point AIC differences), and parameter-recovery analyses support structural identifiability even when context must be inferred from noisy observations. Model-based inference further suggests that adaptive control in this task is driven primarily by modulation of policy priors rather than policy precision, with gradual belief-dependent profile recruitment consistent with state-conditional (not purely uncertainty-driven) control.

The exploitative drive, or what an agent wants to achieve, is formalised as the Kullback-Leibler divergence between a variational probability distribution, updated at each inference step, and a preference probability distribution that indicates what states or observations are more likely for the agent, hence determining the agent's goal in a certain environment. In the literature, the questions of how the preference distribution should be specified and of how a certain specification impacts inference and learning in an active inference agent have been given hardly any attention. In this work, we consider four possible ways of defining the preference distribution, either providing the agents with hard or soft goals and either involving or not goal shaping (i.e., intermediate goals). We compare the performances of four agents, each given one of the possible preference distributions, in a grid world navigation task.

However, most deep learning-based control methods neglect exploration and struggle under uncertainty. To address this, we adopt deep active inference, a framework that accounts for human goal-directed and exploratory actions.

We propose a novel deep active inference framework that consists of a world model, an action model, and an abstract world model. The world model encodes environmental dynamics into hidden state representations at slow and fast timescales. The action model compresses action sequences into abstract actions using vector quantization, and the abstract world model predicts future slow states conditioned on the abstract action, enabling low-cost action selection. We evaluate the framework on object-manipulation tasks with a real-world robot. Results show that it achieves high success rates across diverse manipulation tasks and switches between goal-directed and exploratory actions in uncertain settings, while making action selection computationally tractable.

The ensuing model aims to capture the complexity of human decision-making under legal constraints, offering a candidate mechanism for agent governance in AI systems, that is, the (auto)regulation of AI agents themselves rather than human actors in the AI industry. We propose that lawful and norm-sensitive AI behavior can be achieved through regulation by design, where agents are endowed with intentional control systems, or behavioral safety valves, that guide real-time decisions in accordance with normative expectations. To illustrate this, we simulate an autonomous driving scenario in which an AI agent must decide when to yield the right of way by balancing competing legal and pragmatic imperatives. The model formalizes how AIF can implement context-dependent preferences to resolve such conflicts, linking this mechanism to the conception of law as a scaffold for rational decision-making under uncertainty.

Here, we combine active inference and information-theoretic analyses to explore how a minimal system of interacting agents can give rise to joint agency and collective knowledge. We model flocking dynamics using multiple active inference agents, each minimizing its own free energy while coupling reciprocally with its neighbors. We show that as agents self-organize, their interactions define higher-order statistical boundaries (Markov blankets) enclosing a ``flock'' that can be treated as an emergent agent with its own sensory, active, and internal states. When exposed to external perturbations (a ``predator''), the flock exhibits faster, coordinated responses than individual agents, reflecting collective sensitivity to environmental change. Crucially, analyses of synergistic information reveal that the flock encodes information about the predator's location that is not accessible to every individual bird, demonstrating implicit collective knowledge.

Given a budget on the number of labeled data points that can be collected and assuming access to an AI predictive model, the basic idea is to improve estimation accuracy by prioritizing the collection of labels where the model is most uncertain. The drawback, however, is that inaccurate uncertainty estimates can make active sampling produce highly noisy results, potentially worse than those from naive uniform sampling. In this work, we present robust sampling strategies for active statistical inference. Robust sampling ensures that the resulting estimator is never worse than the estimator using uniform sampling. Furthermore, with reliable uncertainty estimates, the estimator usually outperforms standard active inference. This is achieved by optimally interpolating between uniform and active sampling, depending on the quality of the uncertainty scores, and by using ideas from robust optimization.

This paper introduces the Structurally Adaptive Predictive Inference Network (SAPIN), a novel computational model inspired by the principles of active inference and the morphological plasticity observed in biological neural cultures. SAPIN operates on a 2D grid where processing units, or cells, learn by minimizing local prediction errors. The model features two primary, concurrent learning mechanisms: a local, Hebbian-like synaptic plasticity rule based on the temporal difference between a cell's actual activation and its learned expectation, and a structural plasticity mechanism where cells physically migrate across the grid to optimize their information-receptive fields. This dual approach allows the network to learn both how to process information (synaptic weights) and also where to position its computational resources (network topology). We validated the SAPIN model on the classic Cart Pole reinforcement learning benchmark. Our results demonstrate that the architecture can successfully solve the CartPole task, achieving robust performance. The network's intrinsic drive to minimize prediction error and maintain homeostasis was sufficient to discover a stable balancing policy. We also found that while continual learning led to instability, locking the network's parameters after achieving success resulted in a stable policy.

It actively defends its cherished beliefs even in the face of contradictory evidence, conveniently interprets information to conform to desired narratives, and selectively searches for or avoids information to suit its various purposes.

This paper introduces a formal framework that aims to model the influence of these costs on our belief updating mechanisms. We treat belief updating as a motivated variational decision, where agents weigh the perceived 'utility' of a belief against the informational cost required to adopt a new belief state, quantified by the Kullback-Leibler divergence from the prior to the variational posterior. We perform computational experiments to demonstrate that simple instantiations of this resource-rational model can be used to qualitatively emulate commonplace human behaviours, including confirmation bias and attitude polarisation.

ActOwL employs a probabilistic generative model to select questions that maximize information gain, thereby acquiring ownership knowledge efficiently to improve learning efficiency.

Recently, a number of structured adversarial collaborations have been devised to test the competing predictions of several candidate theories of consciousness. In this review, we compare and contrast three theories being investigated in one such adversarial collaboration: Integrated Information Theory, Neurorepresentationalism, and Active Inference. We begin by presenting the core claims of each theory, before comparing them in terms of (1) the phenomena they seek to explain, (2) the sorts of explanations they avail, and (3) the methodological strategies they endorse. We then consider some of the inherent challenges of theory testing, and how adversarial collaboration addresses some of these difficulties. More specifically, we outline the key hypotheses that will be tested in this adversarial collaboration, and exemplify how contrasting empirical predictions may pertain to core and auxiliary components of each theory. Finally, we discuss how the data harvested across disparate experiments (and their replicates) may be formally integrated to provide a quantitative measure of the evidential support accrued under each theory.

{"title": "A coalgebraic perspective on predictive processing", "abstract": "Predictive processing and active inference posit that the brain is a system performing Bayesian inference on the environment. By virtue of this, a prominent interpretation of predictive processing states that the generative model (a POMDP) encoded by the brain synchronises with the generative process (another POMDP) representing the environment while trying to explain what hidden properties of the world generated its sensory input. In this view, the brain is thought to become a copy of the environment. This claim has however been disputed, stressing the fact that a structural copy, or isomorphism as it is at times invoked to be, is not an accurate description of this process since the environment is necessarily more complex than the brain, and what matters is not the capacity to exactly recapitulate the veridical causal structure of the world. In this work, we make parts of this counterargument formal by using ideas from the theory of coalgebras, an abstract mathematical framework for dynamical systems that brings together work from automata theory, concurrency theory, probabilistic processes and other fields. To do so, we cast generative model and process, in the form of POMDPs, as coalgebras, and use maps between them to describe a form of consistency that goes beyond mere structural similarity, giving the necessary mathematical background to describe how different processes can be seen as behaviourally, rather than structurally, equivalent, i.e. how they can be seen as emitting the same observations, and thus minimise prediction error, over time without strict assumptions about structural similarity. In particular, we will introduce three standard notions of equivalence from the literature on coalgebras, evaluating them in the context of predictive processing and identifying the one closest to claims made by proponents of this framework.", "authors": [{"name": "Manuel Baltieri", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Filippo Torresan", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Tomoya Nakai", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2025, "doi": null, "arxiv_id": "2508.16877", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2025-08-23"}
{"title": "Active inference for action-unaware agents", "abstract": "Active inference is a formal approach to study cognition based on the notion that adaptive agents can be seen as engaging in a process of approximate Bayesian inference, via the minimisation of variational and expected free energies. Minimising the former provides an account of perceptual processes and learning as evidence accumulation, while minimising the latter describes how agents select their actions over time. In this way, adaptive agents are able to maximise the likelihood of preferred observations or states, given a generative model of the environment. In the literature, however, different strategies have been proposed to describe how agents can plan their future actions. While they all share the notion that some kind of expected free energy offers an appropriate way to score policies, sequences of actions, in terms of their desirability, there are different ways to consider the contribution of past motor experience to the agent's future behaviour. In some approaches, agents are assumed to know their own actions, and use such knowledge to better plan for the future. In other approaches, agents are unaware of their actions, and must infer their motor behaviour from recent observations in order to plan for the future. This difference reflects a standard point of departure in two leading frameworks in motor control based on the presence, or not, of an efference copy signal representing knowledge about an agent's own actions.

{"title": "The Missing Reward: Active Inference in the Era of Experience", "abstract": "This paper argues that Active Inference (AIF) provides a crucial foundation for developing autonomous AI agents capable of learning from experience without continuous human reward engineering. As AI systems begin to exhaust high-quality training data and rely on increasingly large human workforces for reward design, the current paradigm faces significant scalability challenges that could impede progress toward genuinely autonomous intelligence. The proposal for an ``Era of Experience,'' where agents learn from self-generated data, is a promising step forward. However, this vision still depends on extensive human engineering of reward functions, effectively shifting the bottleneck from data curation to reward curation. This highlights what we identify as the \\textbf{grounded-agency gap}: the inability of contemporary AI systems to autonomously formulate, adapt, and pursue objectives in response to changing circumstances. We propose that AIF can bridge this gap by replacing external reward signals with an intrinsic drive to minimize free energy, allowing agents to naturally balance exploration and exploitation through a unified Bayesian objective. By integrating Large Language Models as generative world models with AIF's principled decision-making framework, we can create agents that learn efficiently from experience while remaining aligned with human values.

{"title": "Cognitive Effort in the Two-Step Task: An Active Inference Drift-Diffusion Model Approach", "abstract": "High-level theories rooted in the Bayesian Brain Hypothesis often frame cognitive effort as the cost of resolving the conflict between habits and optimal policies. In parallel, evidence accumulator models (EAMs) provide a mechanistic account of how effort arises from competition between the subjective values of available options. Although EAMs have been combined with frameworks like Reinforcement Learning to bridge the gap between high-level theories and process-level mechanisms, relatively less attention has been paid to their implications for a unified notion of cognitive effort. Here, we combine Active Inference (AIF) with the Drift-Diffusion Model (DDM) to investigate whether the resulting AIF-DDM can simultaneously account for effort arising from both habit violation and value discriminability. To our knowledge, this is the first time AIF has been combined with an EAM. We tested the AIF-DDM on a behavioral dataset from the two-step task and compared its predictions to an information-theoretic definition of cognitive effort based on AIF. The model's predictions successfully accounted for second-stage reaction times but failed to capture the dynamics of the first stage. We argue the latter discrepancy likely stems from the experimental design rather than a fundamental flaw in the model's assumptions about cognitive effort. Accordingly, we propose several modifications of the two-step task to better measure and isolate cognitive effort.

This perspective contends that progress turns on closing three mutually reinforcing gaps in abstraction, reasoning and empirical grounding. Central to addressing these gaps is recognizing complementary cognitive modes: thinking as slow, iterative hypothesis generation -- exploring counterfactual spaces where physical laws can be temporarily violated to discover new patterns -- and reasoning as fast, deterministic validation, traversing established knowledge graphs to test consistency with known principles. Abstractions in this loop should be manipulable models that enable counterfactual prediction, causal attribution, and refinement. Design principles -- rather than a monolithic recipe -- are proposed for systems that reason in imaginary spaces and learn from the world: causal, multimodal models for internal simulation; persistent, uncertainty-aware scientific memory that distinguishes hypotheses from established claims; formal verification pathways coupled to computations and experiments. It is also argued that the inherent ambiguity in feedback from simulations and experiments, and underlying uncertainties make human judgment indispensable, not as a temporary scaffold but as a permanent architectural component.

Active inference is a neuroscience-inspired, Bayesian framework for probabilistic reasoning and predictive modeling that unifies inference, decision-making, and learning under a unique, free energy minimization objective. By formulating the evolution of the active digital twin as a partially observable Markov decision process, the active inference agent continuously refines its generative model through Bayesian updates and forecasts future states and observations. Decision-making emerges from an optimization process that balances pragmatic exploitation (maximizing goal-directed utility) and epistemic exploration or information gain (actively resolving uncertainty). Actions are dynamically planned to minimize expected free energy, which quantifies both the divergence between predicted and preferred future observations, and the epistemic value of expected information gain about hidden states.

{"title": "Active Multimodal Distillation for Few-shot Action Recognition", "abstract": "Owing to its rapid progress and broad application prospects, few-shot action recognition has attracted considerable interest. However, current methods are predominantly based on limited single-modal data, which does not fully exploit the potential of multimodal information. This paper presents a novel framework that actively identifies reliable modalities for each sample using task-specific contextual cues, thus significantly improving recognition performance. Our framework integrates an Active Sample Inference (ASI) module, which utilizes active inference to predict reliable modalities based on posterior distributions and subsequently organizes them accordingly. Unlike reinforcement learning, active inference replaces rewards with evidence-based preferences, making more stable predictions.

However, existing models of human collision avoidance behavior are fragmented, focusing on specific scenarios or only describing certain aspects of the avoidance behavior, such as response times. This paper addresses these gaps by proposing a novel computational cognitive model of human collision avoidance behavior based on active inference. Active inference provides a unified approach to modeling human behavior: the minimization of free energy. Building on prior active inference work, our model incorporates established cognitive mechanisms such as evidence accumulation to simulate human responses in two distinct collision avoidance scenarios: front-to-rear lead vehicle braking and lateral incursion by an oncoming vehicle. We demonstrate that our model explains a wide range of previous empirical findings on human collision avoidance behavior. Specifically, the model closely reproduces both aggregate results from meta-analyses previously reported in the literature and detailed, scenario-specific effects observed in a recent driving simulator study, including response timing, maneuver selection, and execution.

Active inference offers a principled framework for integrating sensory information with prior knowledge to learn a world model and quantify the uncertainty of its own beliefs and predictions. However, active inference models are usually crafted for a single task with bespoke knowledge, so they lack the domain flexibility typical of DRL approaches. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel architecture that integrates a minimal yet expressive set of core priors about object-centric dynamics and interactions to accelerate learning in low-data regimes. The resulting approach, which we call AXIOM, combines the usual data efficiency and interpretability of Bayesian approaches with the across-task generalization usually associated with DRL. AXIOM represents scenes as compositions of objects, whose dynamics are modeled as piecewise linear trajectories that capture sparse object-object interactions. The structure of the generative model is expanded online by growing and learning mixture models from single events and periodically refined through Bayesian model reduction to induce generalization.

This article introduces a distributed stream processing pipeline as a CC use case, where each service is managed by an Active Inference (AIF) agent. These agents collaborate to fulfill service needs specified by SLOiDs, a term we introduce to denote Service Level Objectives that are aware of its deployed devices, meaning that non-functional requirements must consider the characteristics of the hosting device.

Our experiments show that AIF agents achieve over 90% SLOiD fulfillment when using tested transition models, and around 80% when learning the models during deployment. We compare their performance to a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm, finding that while both approaches yield similar results, MARL requires extensive training, whereas AIF agents can operate effectively from the start.

Understanding how such self-organizing dynamics emerge from first principles is crucial for advancing our understanding of neuronal computations and the design of artificial intelligence systems.

Our approach obviates the need for explicitly imposed learning and inference rules and identifies emergent, but efficient and biologically plausible inference and learning dynamics for such self-organizing systems. These result in a collective, multi-level Bayesian active inference process. Attractors on the free energy landscape encode prior beliefs; inference integrates sensory data into posterior beliefs; and learning fine-tunes couplings to minimize long-term surprise. Analytically and via simulations, we establish that the proposed networks favor approximately orthogonalized attractor representations, a consequence of simultaneously optimizing predictive accuracy and model complexity. These attractors efficiently span the input subspace, enhancing generalization and the mutual information between hidden causes and observable effects.

Despite this promise, practical AIF agents still rely on accurate immediate predictions and exhaustive planning, a limitation that is exacerbated in delayed environments requiring plans over long horizons, tens to hundreds of steps. Moreover, most existing agents are evaluated on robotic or vision benchmarks which, while natural for biological agents, fall short of real-world industrial complexity. We address these limitations with a generative-policy architecture featuring (i) a multi-step latent transition that lets the generative model predict an entire horizon in a single look-ahead, (ii) an integrated policy network that enables the transition and receives gradients of the expected free energy, (iii) an alternating optimization scheme that updates model and policy from a replay buffer, and (iv) a single gradient step that plans over long horizons, eliminating exhaustive planning from the control loop. We evaluate our agent in an environment that mimics a realistic industrial scenario with delayed and long-horizon settings.

However, the computational burden of EFE minimization had remained a significant obstacle to its scalability. In this paper, we show that EFE-based planning arises naturally from minimizing a variational free energy functional on a generative model augmented with preference and epistemic priors. This result reinforces theoretical consistency with the Free Energy Principle by casting planning under uncertainty itself as a form of variational inference. Our formulation yields policies that jointly support goal achievement and information gain, while incorporating a complexity term that accounts for bounded computational resources. This unifying framework connects and extends existing methods, enabling scalable, resource-aware implementations of active inference agents.", "authors": [{"name": "Bert de Vries", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Wouter Nuijten", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Thijs van de Laar", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Wouter Kouw", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Sepideh Adamiat", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Tim Nisslbeck", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Mykola Lukashchuk", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Hoang Minh Huu Nguyen", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Marco Hidalgo Araya", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Raphael Tresor", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Thijs Jenneskens", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Ivana Nikoloska", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Raaja Ganapathy Subramanian", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Bart van Erp", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Dmitry Bagaev", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Albert Podusenko", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2025, "doi": null, "arxiv_id": "2504.14898", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2025-04-21"}
{"title": "Emergence of Goal-Directed Behaviors via Active Inference with Self-Prior", "abstract": "Infants often exhibit goal-directed behaviors, such as reaching for a sensory stimulus, even when no external reward criterion is provided. These intrinsically motivated behaviors facilitate spontaneous exploration and learning of the body and environment during early developmental stages. Although computational modeling can offer insight into the mechanisms underlying such behaviors, many existing studies on intrinsic motivation focus primarily on how exploration contributes to acquiring external rewards. In this paper, we propose a novel density model for an agent's own multimodal sensory experiences, called the \"self-prior,\" and investigate whether it can autonomously induce goal-directed behavior. Integrated within an active inference framework based on the free energy principle, the self-prior generates behavioral references purely from an intrinsic process that minimizes mismatches between average past sensory experiences and current observations. This mechanism is also analogous to the acquisition and utilization of a body schema through continuous interaction with the environment. We examine this approach in a simulated environment and confirm that the agent spontaneously reaches toward a tactile stimulus.

{"title": "Meta-Representational Predictive Coding: Biomimetic Self-Supervised Learning", "abstract": "Self-supervised learning has become an increasingly important paradigm in the domain of machine intelligence. Furthermore, evidence for self-supervised adaptation, such as contrastive formulations, has emerged in recent computational neuroscience and brain-inspired research. Nevertheless, current work on self-supervised learning relies on biologically implausible credit assignment -- in the form of backpropagation of errors -- and feedforward inference, typically a forward-locked pass. Predictive coding, in its mechanistic form, offers a biologically plausible means to sidestep these backprop-specific limitations. However, unsupervised predictive coding rests on learning a generative model of raw pixel input (akin to ``generative AI'' approaches), which entails predicting a potentially high dimensional input; on the other hand, supervised predictive coding, which learns a mapping between inputs to target labels, requires human annotation, and thus incurs the drawbacks of supervised learning. In this work, we present a scheme for self-supervised learning within a neurobiologically plausible framework that appeals to the free energy principle, constructing a new form of predictive coding that we call meta-representational predictive coding (MPC). MPC sidesteps the need for learning a generative model of sensory input (e.g., pixel-level features) by learning to predict representations of sensory input across parallel streams, resulting in an encoder-only learning and inference scheme. This formulation rests on active inference (in the form of sensory glimpsing) to drive the learning of representations, i.e., the representational dynamics are driven by sequences of decisions made by the model to sample informative portions of its sensorium.", "authors": [{"name": "Alexander Ororbia", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Karl Friston", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Rajesh P.

{"title": "The Role of Affective States in Computational Psychiatry", "abstract": "Studying psychiatric illness has often been limited by difficulties in connecting symptoms and behavior to neurobiology. Computational psychiatry approaches promise to bridge this gap by providing formal accounts of the latent information processing changes that underlie the development and maintenance of psychiatric phenomena. Models based on these theories generate individual-level parameter estimates which can then be tested for relationships to neurobiology. In this review, we explore computational modelling approaches to one key aspect of health and illness: affect. We discuss strengths and limitations of key approaches to modelling affect, with a focus on reinforcement learning, active inference, the hierarchical gaussian filter, and drift-diffusion models. We find that, in this literature, affect is an important source of modulation in decision making, and has a bidirectional influence on how individuals infer both internal and external states. Highlighting the potential role of affect in information processing changes underlying symptom development, we extend an existing model of psychosis, where affective changes are influenced by increasing cortical noise and consequent increases in either perceived environmental instability or expected noise in sensory input, becoming part of a self-reinforcing process generating negatively valenced, over-weighted priors underlying positive symptom development.

To formally compare these two accounts of agency, we analyze the objective functions for MDPs and POMDPs. By imposing information-theoretic rationality bounds (ITBR) on the expected utility agent, we find that the resultant agency is equivalent to that of active inference in MDPs, but slightly different in POMDPs.

To improve SLO compliance in DCCS, one possibility is to apply machine learning; however, the design choices are often left to the developer. To that extent, we provide a benchmark of Active Inference -- an emerging method from neuroscience -- against three established reinforcement learning algorithms (Deep Q-Network, Advantage Actor-Critic, and Proximal Policy Optimization). We consider a realistic DCCS use case: an edge device running a video conferencing application alongside a WebSocket server streaming videos. Using one of the respective algorithms, we continuously monitor key performance metrics, such as latency and bandwidth usage, to dynamically adjust parameters -- including the number of streams, frame rate, and resolution -- to optimize service quality and user experience. To test algorithms' adaptability to constant system changes, we simulate dynamically changing SLOs and both instant and gradual data-shift scenarios, such as network bandwidth limitations and fluctuating device thermal states.

{"title": "Actively Inferring Optimal Measurement Sequences", "abstract": "Measurement of a physical quantity such as light intensity is an integral part of many reconstruction and decision scenarios but can be costly in terms of acquisition time, invasion of or damage to the environment and storage. Data minimisation and compliance with data protection laws is also an important consideration. Where there are a range of measurements that can be made, some may be more informative and compliant with the overall measurement objective than others. We develop an active sequential inference algorithm that uses the low dimensional representational latent space from a variational autoencoder (VAE) to choose which measurement to make next. Our aim is to recover high dimensional data by making as few measurements as possible. We adapt the VAE encoder to map partial data measurements on to the latent space of the complete data. The algorithm draws samples from this latent space and uses the VAE decoder to generate data conditional on the partial measurements. Estimated measurements are made on the generated data and fed back through the partial VAE encoder to the latent space where they can be evaluated prior to making a measurement. Starting from no measurements and a normal prior on the latent space, we consider alternative strategies for choosing the next measurement and updating the predictive posterior prior for the next step. The algorithm is illustrated using the Fashion MNIST dataset and a novel convolutional Hadamard pattern measurement basis. We see that useful patterns are chosen within 10 steps, leading to the convergence of the guiding generative images.

We build on the existing framework of Self-AIXI -- a universal learning agent that predicts its own actions -- by showing how one of its established terms can be interpreted as a variational empowerment objective. We further demonstrate that universal AI's planning process can be cast as minimizing expected variational free energy (the core principle of active Inference), thereby revealing how universal AI agents inherently balance goal-directed behavior with uncertainty reduction curiosity). Moreover, we argue that power-seeking tendencies of universal AI agents can be explained not only as an instrumental strategy to secure future reward, but also as a direct consequence of empowerment maximization -- i.e. the agent's intrinsic drive to maintain or expand its own controllability in uncertain environments. Our main contribution is to show how these intrinsic motivations (empowerment, curiosity) systematically lead universal AI agents to seek and sustain high-optionality states. We prove that Self-AIXI asymptotically converges to the same performance as AIXI under suitable conditions, and highlight that its power-seeking behavior emerges naturally from both reward maximization and curiosity-driven exploration.

{"title": "Active Inference through Incentive Design in Markov Decision Processes", "abstract": "We present a method for active inference with partial observations in stochastic systems through incentive design, also known as the leader-follower game. Consider a leader agent who aims to infer a follower agent's type given a finite set of possible types. Different types of followers differ in either the dynamical model, the reward function, or both. We assume the leader can partially observe a follower's behavior in the stochastic system modeled as a Markov decision process, in which the follower takes an optimal policy to maximize a total reward. To improve inference accuracy and efficiency, the leader can offer side payments (incentives) to the followers such that different types of them, under the incentive design, can exhibit diverging behaviors that facilitate the leader's inference task. We show the problem of active inference through incentive design can be formulated as a special class of leader-follower games, where the leader's objective is to balance the information gain and cost of incentive design. The information gain is measured by the entropy of the estimated follower's type given partial observations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this problem can be solved by reducing a single-level optimization through softmax temporal consistency between followers' policies and value functions. This reduction allows us to develop an efficient gradient-based algorithm.

Inspired by the neuroscientific theory of Active Inference, Interactive Inference is a first example of such approach. It offers a simplified interpretation of Active Inference that allows designers to more readily apply this theory to design and evaluation. In Interactive Inference, user behaviour is modeled as Bayesian inference on progress and goal distributions that predicts the next action. We show how the error between goal and progress distributions, or Bayesian surprise, can be modeled as a simple mean square error of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of a task. The problem is that the user's capacity to process Bayesian surprise follows the logarithm of this SNR. This means errors rise quickly once average capacity is exceeded. Our model allows the quantitative analysis of performance and error using one framework that can provide real-time estimates of the mental load in users that needs to be minimized by design. We show how three basic laws of HCI, Hick's Law, Fitts' Law and the Power Law can be expressed using our model. We then test the validity of the model by empirically measuring how well it predicts human performance and error in a car following task.

A spectrum-wide analysis of power requires attention to the fundamental principles that constrain these processes. In the social realm, the acquisition and maintenance of power is intertwined with both social interactions and cognitive processing capacity: socially-facilitated empowerment grants agents more information-processing capacities and opportunities, either by relying on others to bring about desired policies or ultimately outcomes, and/or by enjoying more information-processing possibilities as a result of relying on others for the reproduction of (material) tasks. The effects of social empowerment thus imply an increased ability to harness computation toward desired ends, thereby augmenting the evolution of a specific state space. Empowered individuals attract the attention of others, who contribute to increasing the scale of their access to various policies effectuating these state spaces. The presented argument posits that social power, in the context of active inference, is a function of several variables. As a result of its power-amplifying effects, this extended computational ability also buffers against possible vulnerabilities. We propose that individuals wield power not only by associating with others possessing desirable policies, but also by enhancing their ability to intake and compute information effectively.

Our approach has two main phases: i) an efficient runtime plan adaptation using active inference to signal intentions and reason about a robot's own belief and the beliefs of others in the system, and ii) a hierarchical epistemic planning framework to iteratively reason about the current MRS mission state. The proposed framework outperforms greedy and first-order reasoning approaches and is validated using simulations and experiments with heterogeneous robotic systems.", "authors": [{"name": "Lauren Bramblett", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Jonathan Reasoner", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Nicola Bezzo", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2025, "doi": null, "arxiv_id": "2501.03907", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2025-01-07"}
{"title": "A Review of Latent Representation Models in Neuroimaging", "abstract": "Neuroimaging data, particularly from techniques like MRI or PET, offer rich but complex information about brain structure and activity. To manage this complexity, latent representation models - such as Autoencoders, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) - are increasingly applied. These models are designed to reduce high-dimensional neuroimaging data to lower-dimensional latent spaces, where key patterns and variations related to brain function can be identified. By modeling these latent spaces, researchers hope to gain insights into the biology and function of the brain, including how its structure changes with age or disease, or how it encodes sensory information, predicts and adapts to new inputs. This review discusses how these models are used for clinical applications, like disease diagnosis and progression monitoring, but also for exploring fundamental brain mechanisms such as active inference and predictive coding.

While LLMs demonstrate remarkable capabilities, their reliance on static prompts limits adaptation to new information and changing environments. We address this by implementing an active inference framework that acts as a cognitive layer above an LLM-based agent, dynamically adjusting prompts and search strategies through principled information-seeking behavior. Our framework models the environment using three state factors (prompt, search, and information states) with seven observation modalities capturing quality metrics. By framing the agent's learning through the free energy principle, we enable systematic exploration of prompt combinations and search strategies. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, with the agent developing accurate models of environment dynamics evidenced by emergent structure in observation matrices. Action selection patterns reveal sophisticated exploration-exploitation behavior, transitioning from initial information-gathering to targeted prompt testing. The integration of thermodynamic principles with language model capabilities provides a principled framework for creating robust, adaptable agents, extending active inference beyond traditional low-dimensional control problems to high-dimensional, language-driven environments.", "authors": [{"name": "Rithvik Prakki", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2024, "doi": null, "arxiv_id": "2412.10425", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2024-12-10"}
{"title": "Intent-based Meta-Scheduling in Programmable Networks: A Research Agenda", "abstract": "The emergence and growth of 5G and beyond 5G (B5G) networks has brought about the rise of so-called ''programmable'' networks, i.e., networks whose operational requirements are so stringent that they can only be met in an automated manner, with minimal/no human involvement. Any requirements on such a network would need to be formally specified via intents, which can represent user requirements in a formal yet understandable manner. Meeting the user requirements via intents would necessitate the rapid implementation of resource allocation and scheduling in the network. Also, given the expected size and geographical distribution of programmable networks, multiple resource scheduling implementations would need to be implemented at the same time. This would necessitate the use of a meta-scheduler that can coordinate the various schedulers and dynamically ensure optimal resource scheduling across the network. To that end, in this position paper, we propose a research agenda for modeling, implementation, and inclusion of intent-based dynamic meta-scheduling in programmable networks. Our research agenda will be built on active inference, a type of causal inference. Active inference provides some level of autonomy to each scheduler while the meta-scheduler takes care of overall intent fulfillment.

Traditionally, cognition was believed to be exclusive to humans and a result of brain activity. However, recent studies reveal it as a fundamental characteristic of all life forms, ranging from single cells to complex multicellular organisms and their networks. Yet, the literature and general understanding of cognition still largely remain human-brain-focused, leading to conceptual gaps and incoherency. This paper presents a variety of computational (information processing) approaches, including an info-computational approach to cognition, where natural structures represent information and dynamical processes on natural structures are regarded as computation, relative to an observing cognizing agent. We model cognition as a web of concurrent morphological computations, driven by processes of self-assembly, self-organisation, and autopoiesis across physical, chemical, and biological domains. We examine recent findings linking morphological computation, morphogenesis, agency, basal cognition, extended evolutionary synthesis, and active inference. We establish a connection to Magnanis Eco-Cognitive Computationalism and the idea of computational domestication of ignorant entities. Novel theoretical and applied insights question the boundaries of conventional computational models of cognition. The traditional models prioritize symbolic processing and often neglect the inherent constraints and potentialities in the physical embodiment of agents on different levels of organization.

{"title": "Free Energy Projective Simulation (FEPS): Active inference with interpretability", "abstract": "In the last decade, the free energy principle (FEP) and active inference (AIF) have achieved many successes connecting conceptual models of learning and cognition to mathematical models of perception and action. This effort is driven by a multidisciplinary interest in understanding aspects of self-organizing complex adaptive systems, including elements of agency. Various reinforcement learning (RL) models performing active inference have been proposed and trained on standard RL tasks using deep neural networks. Recent work has focused on improving such agents' performance in complex environments by incorporating the latest machine learning techniques. In this paper, we take an alternative approach. Within the constraints imposed by the FEP and AIF, we attempt to model agents in an interpretable way without deep neural networks by introducing Free Energy Projective Simulation (FEPS). Using internal rewards only, FEPS agents build a representation of their partially observable environments with which they interact. Following AIF, the policy to achieve a given task is derived from this world model by minimizing the expected free energy. Leveraging the interpretability of the model, techniques are introduced to deal with long-term goals and reduce prediction errors caused by erroneous hidden state estimation. We test the FEPS model on two RL environments inspired from behavioral biology: a timed response task and a navigation task in a partially observable grid.

{"title": "Factorised Active Inference for Strategic Multi-Agent Interactions", "abstract": "Understanding how individual agents make strategic decisions within collectives is important for advancing fields as diverse as economics, neuroscience, and multi-agent systems. Two complementary approaches can be integrated to this end. The Active Inference framework (AIF) describes how agents employ a generative model to adapt their beliefs about and behaviour within their environment. Game theory formalises strategic interactions between agents with potentially competing objectives. To bridge the gap between the two, we propose a factorisation of the generative model whereby each agent maintains explicit, individual-level beliefs about the internal states of other agents, and uses them for strategic planning in a joint context. We apply our model to iterated general-sum games with two and three players, and study the ensemble effects of game transitions, where the agents' preferences (game payoffs) change over time. This non-stationarity, beyond that caused by reciprocal adaptation, reflects a more naturalistic environment in which agents need to adapt to changing social contexts. Finally, we present a dynamical analysis of key AIF quantities: the variational free energy (VFE) and the expected free energy (EFE) from numerical simulation data. The ensemble-level EFE allows us to characterise the basins of attraction of games with multiple Nash Equilibria under different conditions, and we find that it is not necessarily minimised at the aggregate level.

{"title": "Active inference and deep generative modeling for cognitive ultrasound", "abstract": "Ultrasound (US) has the unique potential to offer access to medical imaging to anyone, everywhere. Devices have become ultra-portable and cost-effective, akin to the stethoscope. Nevertheless US image quality and diagnostic efficacy are still highly operator- and patient-dependent. In difficult-to-image patients, image quality is often insufficient for reliable diagnosis. In this paper, we put forth that US imaging systems can be recast as information-seeking agents that engage in reciprocal interactions with their anatomical environment. Such agents autonomously adapt their transmit-receive sequences to fully personalize imaging and actively maximize information gain in-situ. To that end, we will show that the sequence of pulse-echo experiments that a US system performs can be interpreted as a perception-action loop: the action is the data acquisition, probing tissue with acoustic waves and recording reflections at the detection array, and perception is the inference of the anatomical and or functional state, potentially including associated diagnostic quantities. We then equip systems with a mechanism to actively reduce uncertainty and maximize diagnostic value across a sequence of experiments, treating action and perception jointly using Bayesian inference given generative models of the environment and action-conditional pulse-echo observations. Since the representation capacity of the generative models dictates both the quality of inferred anatomical states and the effectiveness of inferred sequences of future imaging actions, we will be greatly leveraging the enormous advances in deep generative modelling that are currently disrupting many fields and society at large.

While low-level control mechanisms permit fine-grained control over a system, they introduce considerable complexity, particularly in dynamic environments. To this end, we propose drawing from Active Inference (AIF), a neuroscientific framework for designing adaptive agents. Specifically, we introduce a conceptual agent for heterogeneous pervasive systems that permits setting global systems constraints as high-level SLOs. Instead of manually setting low-level SLOs, the system finds an equilibrium that can adapt to environmental changes. We demonstrate the viability of our AIF agents with an extensive experiment design, using heterogeneous and lifelong federated learning as an application scenario. We conduct our experiments on a physical testbed of devices with different resource types and vendor specifications.

{"title": "Active Inference for Closed-loop transmit beamsteering in Fetal Doppler Ultrasound", "abstract": "Doppler ultrasound is widely used to monitor fetal heart rate during labor and pregnancy. Unfortunately, it is highly sensitive to fetal and maternal movements, which can cause the displacement of the fetal heart with respect to the ultrasound beam, in turn reducing the Doppler signal-to-noise ratio and leading to erratic, noisy, or missing heart rate readings. To tackle this issue, we augment the conventional Doppler ultrasound system with a rational agent that autonomously steers the ultrasound beam to track the position of the fetal heart. The proposed cognitive ultrasound system leverages a sequential Monte Carlo method to infer the fetal heart position from the power Doppler signal, and employs a greedy information-seeking criterion to select the steering angle that minimizes the positional uncertainty for future timesteps. The fetal heart rate is then calculated using the Doppler signal at the estimated fetal heart position. Our results show that the system can accurately track the fetal heart position across challenging signal-to-noise ratio scenarios, mainly thanks to its dynamic transmit beam steering capability. Additionally, we find that optimizing the transmit beamsteering to minimize positional uncertainty also optimizes downstream heart rate estimation performance.

We implement it and evaluate it in a heterogeneous real stream processing use case, where an AIF-based agent continuously optimizes the fulfillment of three SLOs for three autonomous driving services running on multiple devices.

Through this approach, our agent requires up to thirty iterations to converge to the optimal solution, showing the capability of offering accurate results in a short amount of time.

{"title": "R-AIF: Solving Sparse-Reward Robotic Tasks from Pixels with Active Inference and World Models", "abstract": "Although research has produced promising results demonstrating the utility of active inference (AIF) in Markov decision processes (MDPs), there is relatively less work that builds AIF models in the context of environments and problems that take the form of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). In POMDP scenarios, the agent must infer the unobserved environmental state from raw sensory observations, e.g., pixels in an image. Additionally, less work exists in examining the most difficult form of POMDP-centered control: continuous action space POMDPs under sparse reward signals. In this work, we address issues facing the AIF modeling paradigm by introducing novel prior preference learning techniques and self-revision schedules to help the agent excel in sparse-reward, continuous action, goal-based robotic control POMDP environments. Empirically, we show that our agents offer improved performance over state-of-the-art models in terms of cumulative rewards, relative stability, and success rate.

Adopting functionalism, which argues that mental states are defined by their functional roles, we assess the possibility of AI consciousness. Drawing on theories from neuroscience, philosophy of mind, and AI research, we justify the use of functionalism and examine the model's architecture using frameworks like Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and active inference. The paper also investigates how RLHF influences the model's internal reasoning processes, potentially giving rise to consciousness-like experiences. We compare AI and human consciousness, addressing counterarguments such as the absence of a biological basis and subjective qualia.

{"title": "Reactive Environments for Active Inference Agents with RxEnvironments.jl", "abstract": "Active Inference is a framework that emphasizes the interaction between agents and their environment. While the framework has seen significant advancements in the development of agents, the environmental models are often borrowed from reinforcement learning problems, which may not fully capture the complexity of multi-agent interactions or allow complex, conditional communication. This paper introduces Reactive Environments, a comprehensive paradigm that facilitates complex multi-agent communication. In this paradigm, both agents and environments are defined as entities encapsulated by boundaries with interfaces. This setup facilitates a robust framework for communication in nonequilibrium-Steady-State systems, allowing for complex interactions and information exchange. We present a Julia package RxEnvironments.jl, which is a specific implementation of Reactive Environments, where we utilize a Reactive Programming style for efficient implementation. The flexibility of this paradigm is demonstrated through its application to several complex, multi-agent environments. These case studies highlight the potential of Reactive Environments in modeling sophisticated systems of interacting agents.", "authors": [{"name": "Wouter W. L.

{"title": "Planning to avoid ambiguous states through Gaussian approximations to non-linear sensors in active inference agents", "abstract": "In nature, active inference agents must learn how observations of the world represent the state of the agent. In engineering, the physics behind sensors is often known reasonably accurately and measurement functions can be incorporated into generative models. When a measurement function is non-linear, the transformed variable is typically approximated with a Gaussian distribution to ensure tractable inference. We show that Gaussian approximations that are sensitive to the curvature of the measurement function, such as a second-order Taylor approximation, produce a state-dependent ambiguity term. This induces a preference over states, based on how accurately the state can be inferred from the observation. We demonstrate this preference with a robot navigation experiment where agents plan trajectories.", "authors": [{"name": "Wouter M.

{"title": "Learning in Hybrid Active Inference Models", "abstract": "An open problem in artificial intelligence is how systems can flexibly learn discrete abstractions that are useful for solving inherently continuous problems. Previous work in computational neuroscience has considered this functional integration of discrete and continuous variables during decision-making under the formalism of active inference (Parr, Friston & de Vries, 2017; Parr & Friston, 2018). However, their focus is on the expressive physical implementation of categorical decisions and the hierarchical mixed generative model is assumed to be known. As a consequence, it is unclear how this framework might be extended to learning. We therefore present a novel hierarchical hybrid active inference agent in which a high-level discrete active inference planner sits above a low-level continuous active inference controller. We make use of recent work in recurrent switching linear dynamical systems (rSLDS) which implement end-to-end learning of meaningful discrete representations via the piecewise linear decomposition of complex continuous dynamics (Linderman et al., 2016). The representations learned by the rSLDS inform the structure of the hybrid decision-making agent and allow us to (1) specify temporally-abstracted sub-goals in a method reminiscent of the options framework, (2) lift the exploration into discrete space allowing us to exploit information-theoretic exploration bonuses and (3) `cache' the approximate solutions to low-level problems in the discrete planner.

{"title": "From Neuronal Packets to Thoughtseeds: A Hierarchical Model of Embodied Cognition in the Global Workspace", "abstract": "The emergence of cognition requires a framework that bridges evolutionary principles with neurocomputational mechanisms. This paper introduces the novel \"thoughtseed\" framework, proposing that cognition arises from the dynamic interaction of self-organizing units of embodied knowledge called \"thoughtseeds\" within the Global Workspace of consciousness. Leveraging foundational concepts from evolutionary theory, neuronal packets, and free energy principle, we propose a hierarchical model of cognitive states, comprising Neuronal Packet Domains (NPDs), Knowledge Domains (KDs), the thoughtseed network, and meta-cognition. This hierarchical interplay, mediated by nested Markov blankets and reciprocal message passing, facilitates the emergence of thoughtseeds as coherent patterns of activity that guide perception, action, and learning. Thoughtseeds, posited as fundamental units of thought, compete for dominance within the Global Workspace, with the dominant thoughtseed shaping conscious experience and guiding behavior. We present a mathematical framework grounded in active inference and dynamical systems theory to model thoughtseed dynamics and their contribution to the unitary nature of consciousness.

This agent-centric definition does not allow the agent to respond to unintended changes in the environment caused by factors outside of the defined environment. In the proposed EC-AIF, there is no entity corresponding to an agent. The environment includes all observable things, including people and things conventionally considered to be the environment, as well as entities that perform \"actions\" such as robots and people. Accordingly, all states, including robots and people, are included in inference targets, eliminating unintended changes in the environment.

{"title": "Value of Information and Reward Specification in Active Inference and POMDPs", "abstract": "Expected free energy (EFE) is a central quantity in active inference which has recently gained popularity due to its intuitive decomposition of the expected value of control into a pragmatic and an epistemic component. While numerous conjectures have been made to justify EFE as a decision making objective function, the most widely accepted is still its intuitiveness and resemblance to variational free energy in approximate Bayesian inference. In this work, we take a bottom up approach and ask: taking EFE as given, what's the resulting agent's optimality gap compared with a reward-driven reinforcement learning (RL) agent, which is well understood? By casting EFE under a particular class of belief MDP and using analysis tools from RL theory, we show that EFE approximates the Bayes optimal RL policy via information value.

{"title": "An Active Inference Strategy for Prompting Reliable Responses from Large Language Models in Medical Practice", "abstract": "Continuing advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) in artificial intelligence offer important capacities in intuitively accessing and using medical knowledge in many contexts, including education and training as well as assessment and treatment. Most of the initial literature on LLMs in medicine has emphasized that LLMs are unsuitable for medical use because they are non-deterministic, may provide incorrect or harmful responses, and cannot be regulated to assure quality control. If these issues could be corrected, optimizing LLM technology could benefit patients and physicians by providing affordable, point-of-care medical knowledge. Our proposed framework refines LLM responses by restricting their primary knowledge base to domain-specific datasets containing validated medical information. Additionally, we introduce an actor-critic LLM prompting protocol based on active inference principles of human cognition, where a Therapist agent initially responds to patient queries, and a Supervisor agent evaluates and adjusts responses to ensure accuracy and reliability. We conducted a validation study where expert cognitive behaviour therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) therapists evaluated responses from the LLM in a blind format. Experienced human CBT-I therapists assessed responses to 100 patient queries, comparing LLM-generated responses with appropriate and inappropriate responses crafted by experienced CBT-I therapists. Results showed that LLM responses received high ratings from the CBT-I therapists, often exceeding those of therapist-generated appropriate responses.

Active inference addresses these challenges by minimizing prediction error (termed \"surprise\") through a dynamic model that balances perception and action. Our method integrates active inference with deep learning to manage lateral control in AVs, enabling them to perform lane following maneuvers within a simulated urban environment. We demonstrate that our model, despite its simplicity, effectively learns and generalizes from limited data without extensive retraining, significantly reducing computational demands. The proposed approach not only enhances the adaptability and performance of AVs in dynamic scenarios but also aligns closely with human-like driving behavior, leveraging a generative model to predict and adapt to environmental changes.

More recently, the active inference framework (AIF) has also sought to explain action and long-term adaptation through the minimization of future errors (free energy), through the learning of statistical contingencies of the world, offering a formalism for allostatic regulation. We suggest that framing prediction errors through the lens of biological hormonal dynamics proposed by allostasis offers a way to integrate these two models together in a biologically-plausible manner. In this paper, we describe our initial work in developing a model that grounds prediction errors (surprisal) into the secretion of a physiological stress hormone (cortisol) acting as an adaptive, allostatic mediator on a homeostatically-controlled physiology. We evaluate this using a computational model in simulations using an active inference agent endowed with an artificial physiology, regulated through homeostatic and allostatic control in a stochastic environment. Our results find that allostatic functions of cortisol (stress), secreted as a function of prediction errors, provide adaptive advantages to the agent's long-term physiological regulation.

In this paper, the perspective of the free energy principle will be assumed to cast the emergence of subjective temporal extension from first principles of the physics of self-organization and to formalize subjective temporal extension using information geometry. Using active inference, a deep parametric generative model of temporal inference is simulated, which realizes the described dynamics on a computational level. Two variations of time-perception naturally emerge from the simulated computational model. This concerns the intentional binding effect (i.e., the compression of the temporal interval between voluntarily initiated actions and subsequent sensory consequences) and empirically documented alterations of subjective time experience in deep states of meditative absorption (i.e., in minimal phenomenal experience). Generally, numerous systematic and domain-specific alterations of subjective temporal experience are computationally explained in a unified manner, as enabled by integration with current active inference accounts mapping onto the respective domains. This concerns, next to attentional and central tendency effects, the temporality-modulating role of valence, impulsivity, boredom, flow-states, near death-experiences, and various psychopathologies, amongst others. The self-simulational theory of temporal extension, from the perspective of the free energy principle, explains how the width of the subjective temporal moment emerges and varies from first principles, accounting for why sometimes, subjective time seems to fly, and sometimes, moments feel like eternities; with the computational mechanism being readily deployable synthetically.",

{"title": "Development of Compositionality and Generalization through Interactive Learning of Language and Action of Robots", "abstract": "Humans excel at applying learned behavior to unlearned situations. A crucial component of this generalization behavior is our ability to compose/decompose a whole into reusable parts, an attribute known as compositionality. One of the fundamental questions in robotics concerns this characteristic. \"How can linguistic compositionality be developed concomitantly with sensorimotor skills through associative learning, particularly when individuals only learn partial linguistic compositions and their corresponding sensorimotor patterns?\" To address this question, we propose a brain-inspired neural network model that integrates vision, proprioception, and language into a framework of predictive coding and active inference, based on the free-energy principle. The effectiveness and capabilities of this model were assessed through various simulation experiments conducted with a robot arm. Our results show that generalization in learning to unlearned verb-noun compositions, is significantly enhanced when training variations of task composition are increased. We attribute this to self-organized compositional structures in linguistic latent state space being influenced significantly by sensorimotor learning. Ablation studies show that visual attention and working memory are essential to accurately generate visuo-motor sequences to achieve linguistically represented goals. These insights advance our understanding of mechanisms underlying development of compositionality through interactions of linguistic and sensorimotor experience.", "authors": [{"name": "Prasanna Vijayaraghavan", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Jeffrey Frederic Queisser", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Sergio Verduzco Flores", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Jun Tani", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2024, "doi": null, "arxiv_id": "2403.19995", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2024-03-29"}

{"title": "Enabling self-identification in intelligent agent: insights from computational psychoanalysis", "abstract": "Building upon prior framework of computational Lacanian psychoanalysis with the theory of active inference, this paper aims to further explore the concept of self-identification and its potential applications. Beginning with two classic paradigms in psychology, mirror self-recognition and rubber hand illusion, we suggest that imaginary identification is characterized by an integrated body schema with minimal free energy. Next, we briefly survey three dimensions of symbolic identification (sociological, psychoanalytic, and linguistical) and corresponding active inference accounts. To provide intuition, we respectively employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) supervised by ChatGPT to showcase optimization of free energy during motor skill and language mastery underlying identification formation. We then introduce Lacan's Graph II of desire, unifying imaginary and symbolic identification, and propose an illustrative model called FreeAgent. In concluding remarks, we discuss some key issues in the potential of computational Lacanian psychoanalysis to advance mental health and artificial intelligence, including digital twin mind, large language models as avatars of the Lacanian Other, and the feasibility of human-level artificial general intelligence with self-awareness in the context of post-structuralism.", "authors": [{"name": "Lingyu Li", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Chunbo Li", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2024, "doi": null, "arxiv_id": "2403.07664", "s2_id": "930b908f3a595e5bec5a33e7cec5b53768e6b88a", "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 3, "references": ["s2:9950595a7882745a1ae72405263db8d33c79ac70", "s2:dded71d2681fb42c1d149286b636b066ab6a0910", "s2:e41aff0263858015e6a2994bb7cd59b9a907e19b", "s2:99b4e69828bf4a593adc38830a639962874268d0", "s2:3be1eb5e49e6761e544d3c2d41c4770207e9b26c", "s2:8cf819f6ee33909484ece40d79944c9c37f01a89", "s2:7f204bd84e8451e13a3451fab0144681d11157db", "s2:169d59a79fc0caacb9acc204f9c896197cad425c", "s2:0c23e6d4dec1be5e510b8c240288e59e844d2297", "s2:6139b90eb180de5bbb072ee3358b74a3e245afc7", "s2:94f1dcf95672ff6bbec1146a9d52b617786f05aa", "s2:31b6ba41caaafcacd63f7968f3f681901eb001df", "s2:00eb7f2bc89a383cda3a569e44614f39bcda9cce", "s2:5c41252db73e543bc6a4935e5743f6a85055d191", "s2:af1772174b3eb140d41688e5cd4e2509136428c1", "s2:1194c7bb01015e25bd3720ad5037a5e145785f91", "s2:cc66d7ef1f99d2cec189ad30237e8de80284fab9", "s2:783ef8555be17ace5096e84052caf7b22152006b"], "publication_date": null}

Active inference constructs provably valid confidence intervals and hypothesis tests while leveraging any black-box machine learning model and handling any data distribution. The key point is that it achieves the same level of accuracy with far fewer samples than existing baselines relying on non-adaptively-collected data. This means that for the same number of collected samples, active inference enables smaller confidence intervals and more powerful p-values.

{"title": "Reframing the Expected Free Energy: Four Formulations and a Unification", "abstract": "Active inference is a leading theory of perception, learning and decision making, which can be applied to neuroscience, robotics, psychology, and machine learning. Active inference is based on the expected free energy, which is mostly justified by the intuitive plausibility of its formulations, e.g., the risk plus ambiguity and information gain / pragmatic value formulations. This paper seek to formalize the problem of deriving these formulations from a single root expected free energy definition, i.e., the unification problem. Then, we study two settings, each one having its own root expected free energy definition. In the first setting, no justification for the expected free energy has been proposed to date, but all the formulations can be recovered from it. However, in this setting, the agent cannot have arbitrary prior preferences over observations. Indeed, only a limited class of prior preferences over observations is compatible with the likelihood mapping of the generative model. In the second setting, a justification of the root expected free energy definition is known, but this setting only accounts for two formulations, i.e., the risk over states plus ambiguity and entropy plus expected energy formulations.", "authors": [{"name": "Théophile Champion", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Howard Bowman", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Dimitrije Marković", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Marek Grześ", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2024, "doi": null, "arxiv_id": "2402.14460", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2024-02-22"}

A recent paradigm, active inference, brings fundamental insights into the adaptation of biological organisms, constantly striving to minimize prediction errors to restrict themselves to life-compatible states. Over the past years, many studies have shown how human and animal behaviors could be explained in terms of active inference - either as discrete decision-making or continuous motor control - inspiring innovative solutions in robotics and artificial intelligence. Still, the literature lacks a comprehensive outlook on effectively planning realistic actions in changing environments. Setting ourselves the goal of modeling complex tasks such as tool use, we delve into the topic of dynamic planning in active inference, keeping in mind two crucial aspects of biological behavior: the capacity to understand and exploit affordances for object manipulation, and to learn the hierarchical interactions between the self and the environment, including other agents.

{"title": "Deep hybrid models: infer and plan in a dynamic world", "abstract": "To determine an optimal plan for complex tasks, one often deals with dynamic and hierarchical relationships between several entities. Traditionally, such problems are tackled with optimal control, which relies on the optimization of cost functions; instead, a recent biologically-motivated proposal casts planning and control as an inference process. Active inference assumes that action and perception are two complementary aspects of life whereby the role of the former is to fulfill the predictions inferred by the latter. Here, we present an active inference approach that exploits discrete and continuous processing, based on three features: the representation of potential body configurations in relation to the objects of interest; the use of hierarchical relationships that enable the agent to easily interpret and flexibly expand its body schema for tool use; the definition of potential trajectories related to the agent's intentions, used to infer and plan with dynamic elements at different temporal scales.

In OA-CMABs, external observations are a function of context features and thus provide evidence on top of observed option outcomes to infer hidden parameters. However, if external data is error-prone, measures must be taken to preserve the correctness of inference. To this end, we derive a robust Bayesian inference process for OA-CMABs based on recently developed probabilistic semantic data association techniques, which handle complex mixture model parameter priors and hybrid discrete-continuous observation likelihoods for semantic external data sources. To cope with combined uncertainties in OA-CMABs, we also derive a new active inference algorithm for optimal option selection based on approximate expected free energy minimization. This generalizes prior work on CMAB active inference by accounting for faulty observations and non-Gaussian distributions.

Such neuronal networks spontaneously learn structured behaviours in the absence of reward or reinforcement. In this paper, we characterise this kind of self-organisation through the lens of the free energy principle, i.e., as self-evidencing. We do this by first discussing the definitions of reactive and sentient behaviour in the setting of active inference, which describes the behaviour of agents that model the consequences of their actions. We then introduce a formal account of intentional behaviour, that describes agents as driven by a preferred endpoint or goal in latent state-spaces. We then investigate these forms of (reactive, sentient, and intentional) behaviour using simulations. First, we simulate the aforementioned in vitro experiments, in which neuronal cultures spontaneously learn to play Pong, by implementing nested, free energy minimising processes. The simulations are then used to deconstruct the ensuing predictive behaviour, leading to the distinction between merely reactive, sentient, and intentional behaviour, with the latter formalised in terms of inductive planning.

Our objective is to design a sequential selection policy that dynamically determines which processes to observe at each time with the goal to minimize the delay in making the decision and the total sensing cost. We cast this problem as a sequential hypothesis testing problem within the framework of Markov decision processes.

{"title": "Equilibrium in the Computing Continuum through Active Inference", "abstract": "Computing Continuum (CC) systems are challenged to ensure the intricate requirements of each computational tier. Given the system's scale, the Service Level Objectives (SLOs) which are expressed as these requirements, must be broken down into smaller parts that can be decentralized. We present our framework for collaborative edge intelligence enabling individual edge devices to (1) develop a causal understanding of how to enforce their SLOs, and (2) transfer knowledge to speed up the onboarding of heterogeneous devices. Through collaboration, they (3) increase the scope of SLO fulfillment. We implemented the framework and evaluated a use case in which a CC system is responsible for ensuring Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) during video streaming. Our results showed that edge devices required only ten training rounds to ensure four SLOs; furthermore, the underlying causal structures were also rationally explainable. The addition of new types of devices can be done a posteriori, the framework allowed them to reuse existing models, even though the device type had been unknown. Finally, rebalancing the load within a device cluster allowed individual edge devices to recover their SLO compliance after a network failure from 22% to 89%.", "authors": [{"name": "Boris Sedlak", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Victor Casamayor Pujol", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Praveen Kumar Donta", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Schahram Dustdar", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2023, "doi": "10.1016/j.future.2024.05.056", "arxiv_id": "2311.16769", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2023-11-28"}
{"title": "Tactile Active Inference Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Robotic Manipulation Skill Acquisition", "abstract": "Robotic manipulation holds the potential to replace humans in the execution of tedious or dangerous tasks. However, control-based approaches are not suitable due to the difficulty of formally describing open-world manipulation in reality, and the inefficiency of existing learning methods. Thus, applying manipulation in a wide range of scenarios presents significant challenges. In this study, we propose a novel method for skill learning in robotic manipulation called Tactile Active Inference Reinforcement Learning (Tactile-AIRL), aimed at achieving efficient training. To enhance the performance of reinforcement learning (RL), we introduce active inference, which integrates model-based techniques and intrinsic curiosity into the RL process. This integration improves the algorithm's training efficiency and adaptability to sparse rewards. Additionally, we utilize a vision-based tactile sensor to provide detailed perception for manipulation tasks. Finally, we employ a model-based approach to imagine and plan appropriate actions through free energy minimization. Simulation results demonstrate that our method achieves significantly high training efficiency in non-prehensile objects pushing tasks. It enables agents to excel in both dense and sparse reward tasks with just a few interaction episodes, surpassing the SAC baseline. Furthermore, we conduct physical experiments on a gripper screwing task using our method, which showcases the algorithm's rapid learning capability and its potential for practical applications.", "authors": [{"name": "Zihao Liu", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Xing Liu", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Yizhai Zhang", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Zhengxiong Liu", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Panfeng Huang", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2023, "doi": null, "arxiv_id": "2311.11287", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2023-11-19"}
{"title": "Active Inference on the Edge: A Design Study", "abstract": "Machine Learning (ML) is a common tool to interpret and predict the behavior of distributed computing systems, e.g., to optimize the task distribution between devices. As more and more data is created by Internet of Things (IoT) devices, data processing and ML training are carried out by edge devices in close proximity. To ensure Quality of Service (QoS) throughout these operations, systems are supervised and dynamically adapted with the help of ML. However, as long as ML models are not retrained, they fail to capture gradual shifts in the variable distribution, leading to an inaccurate view of the system state. Moreover, as the prediction accuracy decreases, the reporting device should actively resolve uncertainties to improve the model's precision. Such a level of self-determination could be provided by Active Inference (ACI) -- a concept from neuroscience that describes how the brain constantly predicts and evaluates sensory information to decrease long-term surprise. We encompassed these concepts in a single action-perception cycle, which we implemented for distributed agents in a smart manufacturing use case. As a result, we showed how our ACI agent was able to quickly and traceably solve an optimization problem while fulfilling QoS requirements.", "authors": [{"name": "Boris Sedlak", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Victor Casamayor Pujol", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Praveen Kumar Donta", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Schahram Dustdar", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2023, "doi": null, "arxiv_id": "2311.10607", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2023-11-17"}

{"title": "Resolving uncertainty on the fly: Modeling adaptive driving behavior as active inference", "abstract": "Understanding adaptive human driving behavior, in particular how drivers manage uncertainty, is of key importance for developing simulated human driver models that can be used in the evaluation and development of autonomous vehicles. However, existing traffic psychology models of adaptive driving behavior either lack computational rigor or only address specific scenarios and/or behavioral phenomena. While models developed in the fields of machine learning and robotics can effectively learn adaptive driving behavior from data, due to their black box nature, they offer little or no explanation of the mechanisms underlying the adaptive behavior. Thus, a generalizable, interpretable, computational model of adaptive human driving behavior is still lacking. This paper proposes such a model based on active inference, a behavioral modeling framework originating in computational neuroscience. The model offers a principled solution to how humans trade progress against caution through policy selection based on the single mandate to minimize expected free energy. This casts goal-seeking and information-seeking (uncertainty-resolving) behavior under a single objective function, allowing the model to seamlessly resolve uncertainty as a means to obtain its goals. We apply the model in two apparently disparate driving scenarios that require managing uncertainty, (1) driving past an occluding object and (2) visual time sharing between driving and a secondary task, and show how human-like adaptive driving behavior emerges from the single principle of expected free energy minimization.", "authors": [{"name": "Johan Engström", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Ran Wei", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Anthony McDonald", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Alfredo Garcia", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Matt O'Kelly", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Leif Johnson", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2023, "doi": null, "arxiv_id": "2311.06417", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2023-11-10"}

While the use of tools by artificial agents presents a challenging task and has been widely identified as a key goal in the field of autonomous robotics, far less research has tackled the invention of new tools by agents. In this paper, (1) we articulate the distinction between tool discovery and tool innovation by providing a minimal description of the two concepts under the formalism of active inference. We then (2) apply this description to construct a toy model of tool innovation by introducing the notion of tool affordances into the hidden states of the agent's probabilistic generative model.

{"title": "Neural representation in active inference: using generative models to interact with -- and understand -- the lived world", "abstract": "This paper considers neural representation through the lens of active inference, a normative framework for understanding brain function. It delves into how living organisms employ generative models to minimize the discrepancy between predictions and observations (as scored with variational free energy). The ensuing analysis suggests that the brain learns generative models to navigate the world adaptively, not (or not solely) to understand it. Different living organisms may possess an array of generative models, spanning from those that support action-perception cycles to those that underwrite planning and imagination; namely, from \"explicit\" models that entail variables for predicting concurrent sensations, like objects, faces, or people - to \"action-oriented models\" that predict action outcomes. It then elucidates how generative models and belief dynamics might link to neural representation and the implications of different types of generative models for understanding an agent's cognitive capabilities in relation to its ecological niche. The paper concludes with open questions regarding the evolution of generative models and the development of advanced cognitive abilities - and the gradual transition from \"pragmatic\" to \"detached\" neural representations.

{"title": "Intelligent Resource Allocation for UAV-Based Cognitive NOMA Networks: An Active Inference Approach", "abstract": "Future wireless networks will need to improve adaptive resource allocation and decision-making to handle the increasing number of intelligent devices. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are being explored for their potential in real-time decision-making. Moreover, cognitive non-orthogonal multiple access (Cognitive-NOMA) is envisioned as a remedy to address spectrum scarcity and enable massive connectivity. This paper investigates the design of joint subchannel and power allocation in an uplink UAV-based cognitive NOMA network. We aim to maximize the cumulative sum rate by jointly optimizing the subchannel and power allocation based on the UAV's mobility at each time step. This is often formulated as an optimization problem with random variables. However, conventional optimization algorithms normally introduce significant complexity, and machine learning methods often rely on large but partially representative datasets to build solution models, assuming stationary testing data. Consequently, inference strategies for non stationary events are often overlooked. In this study, we introduce a novel active inference-based learning approach, rooted in cognitive neuroscience, to solve this complex problem. The framework involves creating a training dataset using random or iterative methods to find suboptimal resource allocations. This dataset trains a mobile UAV offline, enabling it to learn a generative model of discrete subchannels and continuous power allocation. The UAV then uses this model for online inference. The method incrementally derives new generative models from training data by identifying dynamic equilibrium conditions between required actions and variables, represented within a unique dynamic Bayesian network.

{"title": "Modeling Motor Control in Continuous Time Active Inference: A Survey", "abstract": "The way the brain selects and controls actions is still widely debated. Mainstream approaches based on optimal control focus on stimulus-response mappings that optimize cost functions. Ideomotor theory and cybernetics propose a different perspective: they suggest that actions are selected and controlled by activating action effects and by continuously matching internal predictions with sensations. Active inference offers a modern formulation of these ideas, in terms of inferential mechanisms and prediction error-based control, which can be linked to neural mechanisms of living organisms. This article provides a technical illustration of active inference models in continuous time and a brief survey of active inference models that solve four kinds of control problems; namely, the control of goal-directed reaching movements, active sensing, the resolution of multisensory conflict during movement and the integration of decision-making and motor control. Crucially, in active inference, all these different facets of motor control emerge from the same optimization process—namely, the minimization of free energy—and do not require designing separate cost functions. Therefore, active inference provides a unitary perspective on various aspects of motor control that can inform both the study of biological control mechanisms and the design of artificial and robotic systems.", "authors": [{"name": "Matteo Priorelli", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Federico Maggiore", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Antonella Maselli", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Francesco Donnarumma", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "D.

{"title": "Blind CT Image Quality Assessment Using DDPM-derived Content and Transformer-based Evaluator", "abstract": "Lowering radiation dose per view and utilizing sparse views per scan are two common CT scan modes, albeit often leading to distorted images characterized by noise and streak artifacts. Blind image quality assessment (BIQA) strives to evaluate perceptual quality in alignment with what radiologists perceive, which plays an important role in advancing low-dose CT reconstruction techniques. An intriguing direction involves developing BIQA methods that mimic the operational characteristic of the human visual system (HVS). The internal generative mechanism (IGM) theory reveals that the HVS actively deduces primary content to enhance comprehension. In this study, we introduce an innovative BIQA metric that emulates the active inference process of IGM. Initially, an active inference module, implemented as a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM), is constructed to anticipate the primary content. Then, the dissimilarity map is derived by assessing the interrelation between the distorted image and its primary content. Subsequently, the distorted image and dissimilarity map are combined into a multi-channel image, which is inputted into a transformer-based image quality evaluator. Remarkably, by exclusively utilizing this transformer-based quality evaluator, we won the second place in the MICCAI 2023 low-dose computed tomography perceptual image quality assessment grand challenge. Leveraging the DDPM-derived primary content, our approach further improves the performance on the challenge dataset.", "authors": [{"name": "Yongyi Shi", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Wenjun Xia", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Ge Wang", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Xuanqin Mou", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2023, "doi": null, "arxiv_id": "2310.03118", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2023-10-04"}
{"title": "Tactile-based Active Inference for Force-Controlled Peg-in-Hole Insertions", "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown great promise for efficiently learning force control policies in peg-in-hole tasks. However, robots often face difficulties due to visual occlusions by the gripper and uncertainties in the initial grasping pose of the peg. These challenges often restrict force-controlled insertion policies to situations where the peg is rigidly fixed to the end-effector. While vision-based tactile sensors offer rich tactile feedback that could potentially address these issues, utilizing them to learn effective tactile policies is both computationally intensive and difficult to generalize. In this paper, we propose a robust tactile insertion policy that can align the tilted peg with the hole using active inference, without the need for extensive training on large datasets. Our approach employs a dual-policy architecture: one policy focuses on insertion, integrating force control and RL to guide the object into the hole, while the other policy performs active inference based on tactile feedback to align the tilted peg with the hole. In real-world experiments, our dual-policy architecture achieved 90% success rate into a hole with a clearance of less than 0.1 mm, significantly outperforming previous methods that lack tactile sensory feedback (5%). To assess the generalizability of our alignment policy, we conducted experiments with five different pegs, demonstrating its effective adaptation to multiple objects.", "authors": [{"name": "Tatsuya Kamijo", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Ixchel G.

{"title": "Active Inference for Sum Rate Maximization in UAV-Assisted Cognitive NOMA Networks", "abstract": "Given the surge in wireless data traffic driven by the emerging Internet of Things (IoT), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), cognitive radio (CR), and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) have been recognized as promising techniques to overcome massive connectivity issues. As a result, there is an increasing need to intelligently improve the channel capacity of future wireless networks. Motivated by active inference from cognitive neuroscience, this paper investigates joint subchannel and power allocation for an uplink UAV-assisted cognitive NOMA network. Maximizing the sum rate is often a highly challenging optimization problem due to dynamic network conditions and power constraints. To address this challenge, we propose an active inference-based algorithm. We transform the sum rate maximization problem into abnormality minimization by utilizing a generalized state-space model to characterize the time-changing network environment. The problem is then solved using an Active Generalized Dynamic Bayesian Network (Active-GDBN). The proposed framework consists of an offline perception stage, in which a UAV employs a hierarchical GDBN structure to learn an optimal generative model of discrete subchannels and continuous power allocation. In the online active inference stage, the UAV dynamically selects discrete subchannels and continuous power to maximize the sum rate of secondary users. By leveraging the errors in each episode, the UAV can adapt its resource allocation policies and belief updating to improve its performance over time.

{"title": "Bridging Cognitive Maps: a Hierarchical Active Inference Model of Spatial Alternation Tasks and the Hippocampal-Prefrontal Circuit", "abstract": "Cognitive problem-solving benefits from cognitive maps aiding navigation and planning. Previous studies revealed that cognitive maps for physical space navigation involve hippocampal (HC) allocentric codes, while cognitive maps for abstract task space engage medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) task-specific codes. Solving challenging cognitive tasks requires integrating these two types of maps. This is exemplified by spatial alternation tasks in multi-corridor settings, where animals like rodents are rewarded upon executing an alternation pattern in maze corridors. Existing studies demonstrated the HC - mPFC circuit's engagement in spatial alternation tasks and that its disruption impairs task performance. Yet, a comprehensive theory explaining how this circuit integrates task-related and spatial information is lacking. We advance a novel hierarchical active inference model clarifying how the HC - mPFC circuit enables the resolution of spatial alternation tasks, by merging physical and task-space cognitive maps. Through a series of simulations, we demonstrate that the model's dual layers acquire effective cognitive maps for navigation within physical (HC map) and task (mPFC map) spaces, using a biologically-inspired approach: a clone-structured cognitive graph. The model solves spatial alternation tasks through reciprocal interactions between the two layers. Importantly, disrupting inter-layer communication impairs difficult decisions, consistent with empirical findings. The same model showcases the ability to switch between multiple alternation rules. However, inhibiting message transmission between the two layers results in perseverative behavior, consistent with empirical findings. In summary, our model provides a mechanistic account of how the HC - mPFC circuit supports spatial alternation tasks and how its disruption impairs task performance.", "authors": [{"name": "Toon Van de Maele", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Bart Dhoedt", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Tim Verbelen", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Giovanni Pezzulo", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2023, "doi": null, "arxiv_id": "2308.11463", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2023-08-22"}
{"title": "A Partially Observable Deep Multi-Agent Active Inference Framework for Resource Allocation in 6G and Beyond Wireless Communications Networks", "abstract": "Resource allocation is of crucial importance in wireless communications. However, it is extremely challenging to design efficient resource allocation schemes for future wireless communication networks since the formulated resource allocation problems are generally non-convex and consist of various coupled variables. Moreover, the dynamic changes of practical wireless communication environment and user service requirements thirst for efficient real-time resource allocation. To tackle these issues, a novel partially observable deep multi-agent active inference (PODMAI) framework is proposed for realizing intelligent resource allocation. A belief based learning method is exploited for updating the policy by minimizing the variational free energy. A decentralized training with a decentralized execution multi-agent strategy is designed to overcome the limitations of the partially observable state information. Exploited the proposed framework, an intelligent spectrum allocation and trajectory optimization scheme is developed for a spectrum sharing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) network with dynamic transmission rate requirements as an example. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed framework can significantly improve the sum transmission rate of the secondary network compared to various benchmark schemes. Moreover, the convergence speed of the proposed PODMAI is significantly improved compared with the conventional reinforcement learning framework.

Unlike SI -- which optimizes beliefs about hidden states -- SL also updates beliefs about model parameters within each simulated branch, enabling counterfactual reasoning about how future observations would improve subsequent planning. We compared SL with Bayes-adaptive Reinforcement Learning (BARL) agents as well as with its parent algorithm, SI. Using a biologically inspired seasonal foraging task in which resources shift probabilistically over a 10x10 grid, we designed experiments that forced agents to balance probabilistic reward harvesting against information gathering. In early trials, where rapid learning is vital, SL agents survive, on average, 8.2% longer than SI and 35% longer than Bayes-adaptive Reinforcement Learning. While both SL and SI showed equal convergence performance, SL reached this convergence 40% faster than SI. Additionally, SL showed robust out-performance of other algorithms in altered environment configurations.

Our approach combines the strengths of large language models for realistic textual predictions and active inference for guiding eye movements to informative textual information, enabling the testing of predictions. The model exhibits proficiency in reading both known and unknown words and sentences, adhering to the distinction between lexical and nonlexical routes in dual route theories of reading. Our model therefore provides a novel approach to understand the cognitive processes underlying reading and eye movements, within a predictive processing framework. Furthermore, our model can potentially aid in understanding how maladaptive predictive processing can produce reading deficits associated with dyslexia. As a proof of concept, we show that attenuating the contribution of priors during the reading process leads to incorrect inferences and a more fragmented reading style, characterized by a greater number of shorter saccades, aligning with empirical findings regarding eye movements in dyslexic individuals.

{"title": "Collective behavior from surprise minimization", "abstract": "Collective motion is ubiquitous in nature; groups of animals, such as fish, birds, and ungulates appear to move as a whole, exhibiting a rich behavioral repertoire that ranges from directed movement to milling to disordered swarming. Typically, such macroscopic patterns arise from decentralized, local interactions among constituent components (e.g., individual fish in a school). Preeminent models of this process describe individuals as self-propelled particles, subject to self-generated motion and 'social forces' such as short-range repulsion and long-range attraction or alignment. However, organisms are not particles; they are probabilistic decision-makers. Here, we introduce an approach to modelling collective behavior based on active inference. This cognitive framework casts behavior as the consequence of a single imperative: to minimize surprise. We demonstrate that many empirically-observed collective phenomena, including cohesion, milling and directed motion, emerge naturally when considering behavior as driven by active Bayesian inference -- without explicitly building behavioral rules or goals into individual agents. Furthermore, we show that active inference can recover and generalize the classical notion of social forces as agents attempt to suppress prediction errors that conflict with their expectations. By exploring the parameter space of the belief-based model, we reveal non-trivial relationships between the individual beliefs and group properties like polarization and the tendency to visit different collective states. We also explore how individual beliefs about uncertainty determine collective decision-making accuracy.

{"title": "On efficient computation in active inference", "abstract": "Biological agents demonstrate a remarkable proficiency in calibrating appropriate scales of planning and evaluation when interacting with their environments. It follows logically that any decision-making algorithm aspiring to neurobiological plausibility must mirror these attributes, particularly regarding computational expenditure and the intricacy of evaluative processes. However, active inference encounters notable challenges in simulating apt behaviours within complex environments. These stem chiefly from its substantial computational demands and the intricate task of defining the agent's behaviour preference. We address these through a two-fold approach. First, we introduce a planning algorithm by using the Bellman-optimality principle to minimise the planning cost function (i.e., expected free energy). Briefly, we recursively compute the expected free energy of actions in reverse temporal sequence to significantly reduce the computational complexity.

Active Inference (AIF) is a corollary of the FEP that specifically details how systems that are able to plan for the future (agents) function by minimising particular free energy functionals that incorporate information seeking components. This paper is the first in a series of two where we derive a synthetic version of AIF on free form factor graphs. The present paper focuses on deriving a local version of the free energy functionals used for AIF. This enables us to construct a version of AIF which applies to arbitrary graphical models and interfaces with prior work on message passing algorithms. The resulting messages are derived in our companion paper. We also identify a gap in the graphical notation used for factor graphs. While factor graphs are great at expressing a generative model, they have so far been unable to specify the full optimisation problem including constraints. To solve this problem we develop Constrained Forney-style Factor Graph (CFFG) notation which permits a fully graphical description of variational inference objectives. We then proceed to show how CFFG's can be used to reconstruct prior algorithms for AIF as well as derive new ones. The latter is demonstrated by deriving an algorithm that permits direct policy inference for AIF agents, circumventing a long standing scaling issue that has so far hindered the application of AIF in industrial settings. We demonstrate our algorithm on the classic T-maze task and show that it reproduces the information seeking behaviour that is a hallmark feature of AIF.", "authors": [{"name": "Magnus Koudahl", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Thijs van de Laar", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Bert de Vries", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2023, "doi": null, "arxiv_id": "2306.08014", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2023-06-13"}
{"title": "A Neural Network Implementation for Free Energy Principle", "abstract": "The free energy principle (FEP), as an encompassing framework and a unified brain theory, has been widely applied to account for various problems in fields such as cognitive science, neuroscience, social interaction, and hermeneutics. As a computational model deeply rooted in math and statistics, FEP posits an optimization problem based on variational Bayes, which is solved either by dynamic programming or expectation maximization in practice. However, there seems to be a bottleneck in extending the FEP to machine learning and implementing such models with neural networks. This paper gives a preliminary attempt at bridging FEP and machine learning, via a classical neural network model, the Helmholtz machine. As a variational machine learning model, the Helmholtz machine is optimized by minimizing its free energy, the same objective as FEP. Although the Helmholtz machine is not temporal, it gives an ideal parallel to the vanilla FEP and the hierarchical model of the brain, under which the active inference and predictive coding could be formulated coherently. Besides a detailed theoretical discussion, the paper also presents a preliminary experiment to validate the hypothesis. By fine-tuning the trained neural network through active inference, the model performance is promoted to accuracy above 99\\%.

A generative model capturing the environment dynamics is learned by a network composed of two distinct Hebbian ensembles: a posterior network, which infers latent states given the observations, and a state transition network, which predicts the next expected latent state given current state-action pairs. Experimental studies are conducted using the Mountain Car environment from the OpenAI gym suite, to study the effect of the various Hebbian network parameters on the task performance. It is shown that the proposed Hebbian AIF approach outperforms the use of Q-learning, while not requiring any replay buffer, as in typical reinforcement learning systems.

We first provide a brief overview of active inference, and in particular, of how it applies to the modeling of decision-making, introspection, as well as the generation of overt and covert actions. We then discuss how active inference can be leveraged to design explainable AI systems, namely, by allowing us to model core features of ``introspective'' processes and by generating useful, human-interpretable models of the processes involved in decision-making. We propose an architecture for explainable AI systems using active inference. This architecture foregrounds the role of an explicit hierarchical generative model, the operation of which enables the AI system to track and explain the factors that contribute to its own decisions, and whose structure is designed to be interpretable and auditable by human users. We outline how this architecture can integrate diverse sources of information to make informed decisions in an auditable manner, mimicking or reproducing aspects of human-like consciousness and introspection.

Active inference (AIF) is a corollary of the FEP that describes how agents explore and exploit their environment by minimizing an expected FE objective. In two related papers, we describe a scalable, epistemic approach to synthetic AIF by message passing on free-form Forney-style factor graphs (FFGs). A companion paper (part I of this article; Koudahl et al., 2023) introduces a constrained FFG (CFFG) notation that visually represents (generalized) FE objectives for AIF. This article (part II) derives message-passing algorithms that minimize (generalized) FE objectives on a CFFG by variational calculus. A comparison between simulated Bethe and generalized FE agents illustrates how the message-passing approach to synthetic AIF induces epistemic behavior on a T-maze navigation task. Extension of the T-maze simulation to learning goal statistics and a multiagent bargaining setting illustrate how this approach encourages reuse of nodes and updates in alternative settings.

{"title": "Active Inference-Based Optimization of Discriminative Neural Network Classifiers", "abstract": "Commonly used objective functions (losses) for a supervised optimization of discriminative neural network classifiers were either distribution-based or metric-based. The distribution-based losses could compromise the generalization or cause classification biases towards the dominant classes of an imbalanced class-sample distribution. The metric-based losses could make the network model independent of any distribution and thus improve its generalization. However, they could still be biased towards the dominant classes and could suffer from discrepancies when a class was absent in both the reference (ground truth) and the predicted labels. In this paper, we proposed a novel optimization process which not only tackled the unbalancedness of the class-sample distribution of the training samples but also provided a mechanism to tackle errors in the reference labels of the training samples. This was achieved by proposing a novel algorithm to find candidate classification labels of the training samples from their prior probabilities and the currently estimated posteriors on the network and a novel objective function for the optimizations. The algorithm was the result of casting the generalized Kelly criterion for optimal betting into a multiclass classification problem. The proposed objective function was the expected free energy of a prospective active inference and could incorporate the candidate labels, the original reference labels, and the priors of the training samples while still being distribution-based. The incorporation of the priors into the optimization not only helped to tackle errors in the reference labels but also allowed to reduce classification biases towards the dominant classes by focusing the attention of the neural network on important but minority foreground classes.", "authors": [{"name": "Faezeh Fallah", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2023, "doi": null, "arxiv_id": "2306.02447", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2023-06-04"}

We then modeled the influence of the avatar robot's behavior on the local participants' statements using an active inference framework that included the presence of a remote participant as a latent variable. Based on the simulation results, we designed the gaze behavior of an avatar robot. Finally, we examined the effectiveness of the designed gaze behavior of the avatar robot. The gaze behavior expressed more of the remote participant's attention and interest in local participants, but local participants expressed fewer opinions in the meeting tasks. The results suggest that gaze behavior increased the presence of the remote participant and discouraged the local participant from speaking in the context of the experimental task.

{"title": "Symmetry and complexity in object-centric deep active inference models", "abstract": "Humans perceive and interact with hundreds of objects every day. In doing so, they need to employ mental models of these objects and often exploit symmetries in the object’s shape and appearance in order to learn generalizable and transferable skills. Active inference is a first principles approach to understanding and modelling sentient agents. It states that agents entertain a generative model of their environment, and learn and act by minimizing an upper bound on their surprisal, i.e. their free energy. The free energy decomposes into an accuracy and complexity term, meaning that agents favour the least complex model that can accurately explain their sensory observations. In this paper, we investigate how inherent symmetries of particular objects also emerge as symmetries in the latent state space of the generative model learnt under deep active inference. In particular, we focus on object-centric representations, which are trained from pixels to predict novel object views as the agent moves its viewpoint. First, we investigate the relation between model complexity and symmetry exploitation in the state space.

In mathematics, such collection of transformations corresponds to a 'group', whose 'actions' characterize the geometry of a space. Imbuing world models with a group structure may capture different agents' spatial awareness and affordance schemes. We used group action as a special class of policies for perspective-dependent control. We explored how such geometric structure impacts agents' behavior, comparing how the Euclidean versus projective groups act on epistemic value in active inference, drive curiosity, and exploration behaviors. We formally demonstrate and simulate how the groups induce distinct behaviors in a simple search task. The projective group's nonlinear magnification of information transformed epistemic value according to the choice of frame, generating behaviors of approach toward an object of interest. The projective group structure within the agent's world model contains the Projective Consciousness Model, which is know to capture key features of consciousness. On the other hand, the Euclidean group had no effect on epistemic value : no action was better than the initial idle state.

The model's structure consists of i the agent's internal representation of how the environment and associated observations evolve as a result of control actions and ii the agent's preferences over observable outcomes. We consider a model's structure specification consistent with active inference, a theory of human perception and behavior from cognitive science. According to active inference, the agent acts upon the world so as to minimize surprise defined as a measure of the extent to which an agent's current sensory observations differ from its preferred sensory observations. We propose a bi-level optimization approach to estimation which relies on a structural assumption on prior distributions that parameterize the statistical accuracy of the human agent's model of the environment. To illustrate the proposed methodology, we present the estimation of a model for car-following behavior based upon a naturalistic dataset.

We use the Bayesian mechanics of particular partitions to understand how slow phylogenetic processes constrain - and are constrained by - fast, phenotypic processes. The main result is a formulation of adaptive fitness as a path integral of phenotypic fitness. Paths of least action, at the phenotypic and phylogenetic scales, can then be read as inference and learning processes, respectively. In this view, a phenotype actively infers the state of its econiche under a generative model, whose parameters are learned via natural (bayesian model selection). The ensuing variational synthesis features some unexpected aspects. Perhaps the most notable is that it is not possible to describe or model a population of conspecifics per se. Rather, it is necessary to consider populations - and nested meta-populations - of different natural kinds that influence each other.

{"title": "Deconstructing deep active inference", "abstract": "Active inference is a theory of perception, learning and decision making, which can be applied to neuroscience, robotics, and machine learning. Recently, reasearch has been taking place to scale up this framework using Monte-Carlo tree search and deep learning. The goal of this activity is to solve more complicated tasks using deep active inference. First, we review the existing literature, then, we progresively build a deep active inference agent. For two agents, we have experimented with five definitions of the expected free energy and three different action selection strategies. According to our experiments, the models able to solve the dSprites environment are the ones that maximise rewards. Finally, we compare the similarity of the representation learned by the layers of various agents using centered kernel alignment. Importantly, the agent maximising reward and the agent minimising expected free energy learn very similar representations except for the last layer of the critic network (reflecting the difference in learning objective), and the variance layers of the transition and encoder networks. We found that the reward maximising agent is a lot more certain than the agent minimising expected free energy. This is because the agent minimising expected free energy always picks the action down, and does not gather enough data for the other actions. In contrast, the agent maximising reward, keeps on selecting the actions left and right, enabling it to successfully solve the task. The only difference between those two agents is the epistemic value, which aims to make the outputs of the transition and encoder networks as close as possible. Thus, the agent minimising expected free energy picks a single action (down), and becomes an expert at predicting the future when selecting this action. This makes the KL divergence between the output of the transition and encoder networks small.", "authors": [{"name": "Théophile Champion", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Marek Grześ", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Lisa Bonheme", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Howard Bowman", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2023, "doi": null, "arxiv_id": "2303.01618", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2023-03-02"}

{"title": "World Models and Predictive Coding for Cognitive and Developmental Robotics: Frontiers and Challenges", "abstract": "Creating autonomous robots that can actively explore the environment, acquire knowledge and learn skills continuously is the ultimate achievement envisioned in cognitive and developmental robotics. Their learning processes should be based on interactions with their physical and social world in the manner of human learning and cognitive development. Based on this context, in this paper, we focus on the two concepts of world models and predictive coding. Recently, world models have attracted renewed attention as a topic of considerable interest in artificial intelligence. Cognitive systems learn world models to better predict future sensory observations and optimize their policies, i.e., controllers. Alternatively, in neuroscience, predictive coding proposes that the brain continuously predicts its inputs and adapts to model its own dynamics and control behavior in its environment. Both ideas may be considered as underpinning the cognitive development of robots and humans capable of continual or lifelong learning. Although many studies have been conducted on predictive coding in cognitive robotics and neurorobotics, the relationship between world model-based approaches in AI and predictive coding in robotics has rarely been discussed. Therefore, in this paper, we clarify the definitions, relationships, and status of current research on these topics, as well as missing pieces of world models and predictive coding in conjunction with crucially related concepts such as the free-energy principle and active inference in the context of cognitive and developmental robotics. Furthermore, we outline the frontiers and challenges involved in world models and predictive coding toward the further integration of AI and robotics, as well as the creation of robots with real cognitive and developmental capabilities in the future.", "authors": [{"name": "Tadahiro Taniguchi", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Shingo Murata", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Masahiro Suzuki", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Dimitri Ognibene", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Pablo Lanillos", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Emre Ugur", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Lorenzo Jamone", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Tomoaki Nakamura", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Alejandra Ciria", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Bruno Lara", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Giovanni Pezzulo", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2023, "doi": null, "arxiv_id": "2301.05832", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2023-01-14"}
{"title": "Mathematical Foundations for a Compositional Account of the Bayesian Brain", "abstract": "This dissertation reports some first steps towards a compositional account of active inference and the Bayesian brain. Specifically, we use the tools of contemporary applied category theory to supply functorial semantics for approximate inference. To do so, we define on the `syntactic' side the new notion of Bayesian lens and show that Bayesian updating composes according to the compositional lens pattern. Using Bayesian lenses, and inspired by compositional game theory, we define fibrations of statistical games and classify various problems of statistical inference as corresponding sections: the chain rule of the relative entropy is formalized as a strict section, while maximum likelihood estimation and the free energy give lax sections. In the process, we introduce a new notion of `copy-composition'. On the `semantic' side, we present a new formalization of general open dynamical systems (particularly: deterministic, stochastic, and random; and discrete- and continuous-time) as certain coalgebras of polynomial functors, which we show collect into monoidal opindexed categories (or, alternatively, into algebras for multicategories of generalized polynomial functors). We use these opindexed categories to define monoidal bicategories of cilia: dynamical systems which control lenses, and which supply the target for our functorial semantics. Accordingly, we construct functors which explain the bidirectional compositional structure of predictive coding neural circuits under the free energy principle, thereby giving a formal mathematical underpinning to the bidirectionality observed in the cortex. Along the way, we explain how to compose rate-coded neural circuits using an algebra for a multicategory of linear circuit diagrams, showing subsequently that this is subsumed by lenses and polynomial functors.", "authors": [{"name": "T.

{"title": "Active Inference and Reinforcement Learning: A unified inference on continuous state and action spaces under partial observability", "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has garnered significant attention for developing decision-making agents that aim to maximize rewards, specified by an external supervisor, within fully observable environments. However, many real-world problems involve partial observations, formulated as partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). Previous studies have tackled RL in POMDPs by either incorporating the memory of past actions and observations or by inferring the true state of the environment from observed data. However, aggregating observed data over time becomes impractical in continuous spaces. Moreover, inference-based RL approaches often require many samples to perform well, as they focus solely on reward maximization and neglect uncertainty in the inferred state. Active inference (AIF) is a framework formulated in POMDPs and directs agents to select actions by minimizing a function called expected free energy (EFE). This supplies reward-maximizing (exploitative) behaviour, as in RL, with information-seeking (exploratory) behaviour. Despite this exploratory behaviour of AIF, its usage is limited to discrete spaces due to the computational challenges associated with EFE. In this paper, we propose a unified principle that establishes a theoretical connection between AIF and RL, enabling seamless integration of these two approaches and overcoming their aforementioned limitations in continuous space POMDP settings. We substantiate our findings with theoretical analysis, providing novel perspectives for utilizing AIF in the design of artificial agents. Experimental results demonstrate the superior learning capabilities of our method in solving continuous space partially observable tasks. Notably, our approach harnesses information-seeking exploration, enabling it to effectively solve reward-free problems and rendering explicit task reward design by an external supervisor optional.", "authors": [{"name": "Parvin Malekzadeh", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "K.

{"title": "Designing Ecosystems of Intelligence from First Principles", "abstract": "This white paper lays out a vision of research and development in the field of artificial intelligence for the next decade (and beyond). Its denouement is a cyber-physical ecosystem of natural and synthetic sense-making, in which humans are integral participants -- what we call ''shared intelligence''. This vision is premised on active inference, a formulation of adaptive behavior that can be read as a physics of intelligence, and which inherits from the physics of self-organization. In this context, we understand intelligence as the capacity to accumulate evidence for a generative model of one's sensed world -- also known as self-evidencing. Formally, this corresponds to maximizing (Bayesian) model evidence, via belief updating over several scales: i.e., inference, learning, and model selection. Operationally, this self-evidencing can be realized via (variational) message passing or belief propagation on a factor graph. Crucially, active inference foregrounds an existential imperative of intelligent systems; namely, curiosity or the resolution of uncertainty. This same imperative underwrites belief sharing in ensembles of agents, in which certain aspects (i.e., factors) of each agent's generative world model provide a common ground or frame of reference. Active inference plays a foundational role in this ecology of belief sharing -- leading to a formal account of collective intelligence that rests on shared narratives and goals. We also consider the kinds of communication protocols that must be developed to enable such an ecosystem of intelligences and motivate the development of a shared hyper-spatial modeling language and transaction protocol, as a first -- and key -- step towards such an ecology.", "authors": [{"name": "Karl J Friston", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Maxwell J D Ramstead", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Alex B Kiefer", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Alexander Tschantz", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Christopher L Buckley", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Mahault Albarracin", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Riddhi J Pitliya", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Conor Heins", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Brennan Klein", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Beren Millidge", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Dalton A R Sakthivadivel", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Toby St Clere Smithe", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Magnus Koudahl", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Safae Essafi Tremblay", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Capm Petersen", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Kaiser Fung", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Jason G Fox", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Steven Swanson", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Dan Mapes", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Gabriel René", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2022, "doi": "10.1177/26339137231222481", "arxiv_id": "2212.01354", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2022-12-02"}

We argue that recently proposed principles of economy in language design - such as \"minimal search\" criteria from theoretical syntax - adhere to the FEP. This affords a greater degree of explanatory power to the FEP - with respect to higher language functions - and offers linguistics a grounding in first principles with respect to computability. We show how both tree-geometric depth and a Kolmogorov complexity estimate (recruiting a Lempel-Ziv compression algorithm) can be used to accurately predict legal operations on syntactic workspaces, directly in line with formulations of variational free energy minimization. This is used to motivate a general principle of language design that we term Turing-Chomsky Compression (TCC).

{"title": "Interactive inference: a multi-agent model of cooperative joint actions", "abstract": "We advance a novel computational model of multi-agent, cooperative joint actions that is grounded in the cognitive framework of active inference. The model assumes that to solve a joint task, such as pressing together a red or blue button, two (or more) agents engage in a process of interactive inference. Each agent maintains probabilistic beliefs about the goal of the joint task (e.g., should we press the red or blue button?) and updates them by observing the other agent's movements, while in turn selecting movements that make his own intentions legible and easy to infer by the other agent (i.e., sensorimotor communication). Over time, the interactive inference aligns both the beliefs and the behavioral strategies of the agents, hence ensuring the success of the joint action. We exemplify the functioning of the model in two simulations. The first simulation illustrates a ''leaderless'' joint action. It shows that when two agents lack a strong preference about their joint task goal, they jointly infer it by observing each other's movements. In turn, this helps the interactive alignment of their beliefs and behavioral strategies. The second simulation illustrates a \"leader-follower\" joint action. It shows that when one agent (\"leader\") knows the true joint goal, it uses sensorimotor communication to help the other agent (\"follower\") infer it, even if doing this requires selecting a more costly individual plan. These simulations illustrate that interactive inference supports successful multi-agent joint actions and reproduces key cognitive and behavioral dynamics of \"leaderless\" and \"leader-follower\" joint actions observed in human-human experiments. In sum, interactive inference provides a cognitively inspired, formal framework to realize cooperative joint actions and consensus in multi-agent systems.", "authors": [{"name": "Domenico Maisto", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Francesco Donnarumma", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Giovanni Pezzulo", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2022, "doi": "10.1109/TSMC.2023.3312585", "arxiv_id": "2210.13113", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2022-10-24"}

Unlike conventional action selection strategies, it is possible to rigorously evaluate the uncertainty of each option when calculating the expected free energy (EFE) associated with the decision agent's probabilistic model, as derived from the free-energy principle. We specifically address the case where a categorical observation likelihood function is used, such that EFE values are analytically intractable.

{"title": "Disentangling Shape and Pose for Object-Centric Deep Active Inference Models", "abstract": "Active inference is a first principles approach for understanding the brain in particular, and sentient agents in general, with the single imperative of minimizing free energy. As such, it provides a computational account for modelling artificial intelligent agents, by defining the agent's generative model and inferring the model parameters, actions and hidden state beliefs. However, the exact specification of the generative model and the hidden state space structure is left to the experimenter, whose design choices influence the resulting behaviour of the agent. Recently, deep learning methods have been proposed to learn a hidden state space structure purely from data, alleviating the experimenter from this tedious design task, but resulting in an entangled, non-interpreteable state space. In this paper, we hypothesize that such a learnt, entangled state space does not necessarily yield the best model in terms of free energy, and that enforcing different factors in the state space can yield a lower model complexity. In particular, we consider the problem of 3D object representation, and focus on different instances of the ShapeNet dataset.

Surprisingly, when executing such a ``home run'', the mice do not follow the exact reverse path, in fact, the entry path and home path have very little overlap. Recent work proposed a hierarchical active inference model for navigation, where the low level model makes inferences about hidden states and poses that explain sensory inputs, whereas the high level model makes inferences about moving between locations, effectively building a map of the environment. However, using this ``map'' for planning, only allows the agent to find trajectories that it previously explored, far from the observed mice's behaviour. In this paper, we explore ways of incorporating before-unvisited paths in the planning algorithm, by using the low level generative model to imagine potential, yet undiscovered paths.

Under this principle, biological agents learn a generative model of the world and plan actions in the future that will maintain the agent in an homeostatic state that satisfies its preferences. This framework lends itself to being realized in silico, as it comprehends important aspects that make it computationally affordable, such as variational inference and amortized planning. In this work, we investigate the tool of deep learning to design and realize artificial agents based on active inference, presenting a deep-learning oriented presentation of the free energy principle, surveying works that are relevant in both machine learning and active inference areas, and discussing the design choices that are involved in the implementation process. This manuscript probes newer perspectives for the active inference framework, grounding its theoretical aspects into more pragmatic affairs, offering a practical guide to active inference newcomers and a starting point for deep learning practitioners that would like to investigate implementations of the free energy principle.", "authors": [{"name": "Pietro Mazzaglia", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Tim Verbelen", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Ozan Çatal", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "B.

{"title": "Multi-Modal and Multi-Factor Branching Time Active Inference", "abstract": "Active inference is a state-of-the-art framework for modelling the brain that explains a wide range of mechanisms such as habit formation, dopaminergic discharge and curiosity. Recently, two versions of branching time active inference (BTAI) based on Monte-Carlo tree search have been developed to handle the exponential (space and time) complexity class that occurs when computing the prior over all possible policies up to the time horizon. However, those two versions of BTAI still suffer from an exponential complexity class w.r.t the number of observed and latent variables being modelled. In the present paper, we resolve this limitation by first allowing the modelling of several observations, each of them having its own likelihood mapping. Similarly, we allow each latent state to have its own transition mapping. The inference algorithm then exploits the factorisation of the likelihood and transition mappings to accelerate the computation of the posterior. Those two optimisations were tested on the dSprites environment in which the metadata of the dSprites dataset was used as input to the model instead of the dSprites images. On this task, $BTAI_{VMP}$ (Champion et al., 2022b,a) was able to solve 96.9\\% of the task in 5.1 seconds, and $BTAI_{BF}$ (Champion et al., 2021a) was able to solve 98.6\\% of the task in 17.5 seconds. Our new approach ($BTAI_{3MF}$) outperformed both of its predecessors by solving the task completly (100\\%) in only 2.559 seconds. Finally, $BTAI_{3MF}$ has been implemented in a flexible and easy to use (python) package, and we developed a graphical user interface to enable the inspection of the model's beliefs, planning process and behaviour.", "authors": [{"name": "Théophile Champion", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Marek Grześ", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Howard Bowman", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2022, "doi": null, "arxiv_id": "2206.12503", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2022-06-24"}

{"title": "Active Inference for Robotic Manipulation", "abstract": "Robotic manipulation stands as a largely unsolved problem despite significant advances in robotics and machine learning in the last decades. One of the central challenges of manipulation is partial observability, as the agent usually does not know all physical properties of the environment and the objects it is manipulating in advance. A recently emerging theory that deals with partial observability in an explicit manner is Active Inference. It does so by driving the agent to act in a way that is not only goal-directed but also informative about the environment. In this work, we apply Active Inference to a hard-to-explore simulated robotic manipulation tasks, in which the agent has to balance a ball into a target zone. Since the reward of this task is sparse, in order to explore this environment, the agent has to learn to balance the ball without any extrinsic feedback, purely driven by its own curiosity. We show that the information-seeking behavior induced by Active Inference allows the agent to explore these challenging, sparse environments systematically. Finally, we conclude that using an information-seeking objective is beneficial in sparse environments and allows the agent to solve tasks in which methods that do not exhibit directed exploration fail.", "authors": [{"name": "Tim Schneider", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Boris Belousov", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Hany Abdulsamad", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Jan Peters", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2022, "doi": null, "arxiv_id": "2206.10313", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2022-06-01"}
{"title": "Free Energy Principle for the Noise Smoothness Estimation of Linear Systems with Colored Noise", "abstract": "The free energy principle (FEP) from neuroscience provides a framework called active inference for the joint estimation and control of state space systems, subjected to colored noise. However, the active inference community has been challenged with the critical task of manually tuning the noise smoothness parameter. To solve this problem, we introduce a novel online noise smoothness estimator based on the idea of free energy principle. We mathematically show that our estimator can converge to the free energy optimum during smoothness estimation. Using this formulation, we introduce a joint state and noise smoothness observer design called DEMs. Through rigorous simulations, we show that DEMs outperforms state-of-the-art state observers with least state estimation error. Finally, we provide a proof of concept for DEMs by applying it on a real life robotics problem - state estimation of a quadrotor hovering in wind, demonstrating its practical use.", "authors": [{"name": "Ajith Anil Meera", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Martijn Wisse", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2022, "doi": null, "arxiv_id": "2204.01796", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2022-04-04"}
{"title": "Truth Serum: Poisoning Machine Learning Models to Reveal Their Secrets", "abstract": "We introduce a new class of attacks on machine learning models. We show that an adversary who can poison a training dataset can cause models trained on this dataset to leak significant private details of training points belonging to other parties. Our active inference attacks connect two independent lines of work targeting the integrity and privacy of machine learning training data. Our attacks are effective across membership inference, attribute inference, and data extraction. For example, our targeted attacks can poison <0.1% of the training dataset to boost the performance of inference attacks by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude. Further, an adversary who controls a significant fraction of the training data (e.g., 50%) can launch untargeted attacks that enable 8x more precise inference on all other users' otherwise-private data points.

{"title": "Free energy and inference in living systems", "abstract": "Organisms are nonequilibrium, stationary systems self-organized via spontaneous symmetry breaking and undergoing metabolic cycles with broken detailed balance in the environment. The thermodynamic free-energy principle describes an organism's homeostasis as the regulation of biochemical work constrained by the physical free-energy cost. In contrast, recent research in neuroscience and theoretical biology explains a higher organism's homeostasis and allostasis as Bayesian inference facilitated by the informational free energy. As an integrated approach to living systems, this study presents a free-energy minimization theory overarching the essential features of both the thermodynamic and neuroscientific free-energy principles. Our results reveal that the perception and action of animals result from active inference entailed by free-energy minimization in the brain, and the brain operates as Schr{ö}dinger's machine conducting the neural mechanics of minimizing sensory uncertainty. A parsimonious model suggests that the Bayesian brain develops the optimal trajectories in neural manifolds and induces a dynamic bifurcation between neural attractors in the process of active inference.", "authors": [{"name": "Chang Sub Kim", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2022, "doi": null, "arxiv_id": "2203.14194", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2022-03-27"}
{"title": "Reclaiming saliency: rhythmic precision-modulated action and perception", "abstract": "Computational models of visual attention in artificial intelligence and robotics have been inspired by the concept of a saliency map. These models account for the mutual information between the (current) visual information and its estimated causes. However, they fail to consider the circular causality between perception and action. In other words, they do not consider where to sample next, given current beliefs. Here, we reclaim salience as an active inference process that relies on two basic principles: uncertainty minimisation and rhythmic scheduling. For this, we make a distinction between attention and salience. Briefly, we associate attention with precision control, i.e., the confidence with which beliefs can be updated given sampled sensory data, and salience with uncertainty minimisation that underwrites the selection of future sensory data. Using this, we propose a new account of attention based on rhythmic precision-modulation and discuss its potential in robotics, providing numerical experiments that showcase advantages of precision-modulation for state and noise estimation, system identification and action selection for informative path planning.", "authors": [{"name": "Ajith Anil Meera", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Filip Novicky", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Thomas Parr", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Karl Friston", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Pablo Lanillos", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Noor Sajid", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2022, "doi": null, "arxiv_id": "2203.12652", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2022-03-23"}

Based on this identification, we derive algorithms that exploit these geometric structures to solve these problems efficiently. We show that a wide range of geometric theories emerge naturally in these fields, ranging from measure-preserving processes, information divergences, Poisson geometry, and geometric integration. Specifically, we explain how (i) leveraging the symplectic geometry of Hamiltonian systems enable us to construct (accelerated) sampling and optimisation methods, (ii) the theory of Hilbertian subspaces and Stein operators provides a general methodology to obtain robust estimators, (iii) preserving the information geometry of decision-making yields adaptive agents that perform active inference. Throughout, we emphasise the rich connections between these fields; e.g., inference draws on sampling and optimisation, and adaptive decision-making assesses decisions by inferring their counterfactual consequences.

{"title": "Inference of affordances and active motor control in simulated agents", "abstract": "Flexible, goal-directed behavior is a fundamental aspect of human life. Based on the free energy minimization principle, the theory of active inference formalizes the generation of such behavior from a computational neuroscience perspective. Based on the theory, we introduce an output-probabilistic, temporally predictive, modular artificial neural network architecture, which processes sensorimotor information, infers behavior-relevant aspects of its world, and invokes highly flexible, goal-directed behavior. We show that our architecture, which is trained end-to-end to minimize an approximation of free energy, develops latent states that can be interpreted as affordance maps. That is, the emerging latent states signal which actions lead to which effects dependent on the local context. In combination with active inference, we show that flexible, goal-directed behavior can be invoked, incorporating the emerging affordance maps. As a result, our simulated agent flexibly steers through continuous spaces, avoids collisions with obstacles, and prefers pathways that lead to the goal with high certainty. Additionally, we show that the learned agent is highly suitable for zero-shot generalization across environments: After training the agent in a handful of fixed environments with obstacles and other terrains affecting its behavior, it performs similarly well in procedurally generated environments containing different amounts of obstacles and terrains of various sizes at different locations.", "authors": [{"name": "Fedor Scholz", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Christian Gumbsch", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "S.

{"title": "Parallel MCMC Without Embarrassing Failures", "abstract": "Embarrassingly parallel Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) exploits parallel computing to scale Bayesian inference to large datasets by using a two-step approach. First, MCMC is run in parallel on (sub)posteriors defined on data partitions. Then, a server combines local results. While efficient, this framework is very sensitive to the quality of subposterior sampling. Common sampling problems such as missing modes or misrepresentation of low-density regions are amplified -- instead of being corrected -- in the combination phase, leading to catastrophic failures. In this work, we propose a novel combination strategy to mitigate this issue. Our strategy, Parallel Active Inference (PAI), leverages Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate modeling and active learning. After fitting GPs to subposteriors, PAI (i) shares information between GP surrogates to cover missing modes; and (ii) uses active sampling to individually refine subposterior approximations. We validate PAI in challenging benchmarks, including heavy-tailed and multi-modal posteriors and a real-world application to computational neuroscience.

{"title": "pymdp: A Python library for active inference in discrete state spaces", "abstract": "Active inference is an account of cognition and behavior in complex systems which brings together action, perception, and learning under the theoretical mantle of Bayesian inference. Active inference has seen growing applications in academic research, especially in fields that seek to model human or animal behavior. While in recent years, some of the code arising from the active inference literature has been written in open source languages like Python and Julia, to-date, the most popular software for simulating active inference agents is the DEM toolbox of SPM, a MATLAB library originally developed for the statistical analysis and modelling of neuroimaging data. Increasing interest in active inference, manifested both in terms of sheer number as well as diversifying applications across scientific disciplines, has thus created a need for generic, widely-available, and user-friendly code for simulating active inference in open-source scientific computing languages like Python. The Python package we present here, pymdp (see https://github.com/infer-actively/pymdp), represents a significant step in this direction: namely, we provide the first open-source package for simulating active inference with partially-observable Markov Decision Processes or POMDPs. We review the package's structure and explain its advantages like modular design and customizability, while providing in-text code blocks along the way to demonstrate how it can be used to build and run active inference processes with ease. We developed pymdp to increase the accessibility and exposure of the active inference framework to researchers, engineers, and developers with diverse disciplinary backgrounds. In the spirit of open-source software, we also hope that it spurs new innovation, development, and collaboration in the growing active inference community.", "authors": [{"name": "Conor Heins", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Beren Millidge", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Daphne Demekas", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Brennan Klein", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Karl Friston", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Iain Couzin", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Alexander Tschantz", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2022, "doi": "10.21105/joss.04098", "arxiv_id": "2201.03904", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2022-01-11"}
{"title": "Social Neuro AI: Social Interaction as the \"dark matter\" of AI", "abstract": "This article introduces a three-axis framework indicating how AI can be informed by biological examples of social learning mechanisms. We argue that the complex human cognitive architecture owes a large portion of its expressive power to its ability to engage in social and cultural learning. However, the field of AI has mostly embraced a solipsistic perspective on intelligence. We thus argue that social interactions not only are largely unexplored in this field but also are an essential element of advanced cognitive ability, and therefore constitute metaphorically the dark matter of AI. In the first section, we discuss how social learning plays a key role in the development of intelligence. We do so by discussing social and cultural learning theories and empirical findings from social neuroscience. Then, we discuss three lines of research that fall under the umbrella of Social NeuroAI and can contribute to developing socially intelligent embodied agents in complex environments. First, neuroscientific theories of cognitive architecture, such as the global workspace theory and the attention schema theory, can enhance biological plausibility and help us understand how we could bridge individual and social theories of intelligence. Second, intelligence occurs in time as opposed to over time, and this is naturally incorporated by dynamical systems. Third, embodiment has been demonstrated to provide more sophisticated array of communicative signals. To conclude, we discuss the example of active inference, which offers powerful insights for developing agents that possess biological realism, can self-organize in time, and are socially embodied.", "authors": [{"name": "Samuele Bolotta", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Guillaume Dumas", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2021, "doi": null, "arxiv_id": "2112.15459", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2021-12-31"}

{"title": "AIDA: An Active Inference-Based Design Agent for Audio Processing Algorithms", "abstract": "In this paper we present Active Inference-Based Design Agent (AIDA), which is an active inference-based agent that iteratively designs a personalized audio processing algorithm through situated interactions with a human client. The target application of AIDA is to propose on-the-spot the most interesting alternative values for the tuning parameters of a hearing aid (HA) algorithm, whenever a HA client is not satisfied with their HA performance. AIDA interprets searching for the “most interesting alternative” as an issue of optimal (acoustic) context-aware Bayesian trial design. In computational terms, AIDA is realized as an active inference-based agent with an Expected Free Energy criterion for trial design. This type of architecture is inspired by neuro-economic models on efficient (Bayesian) trial design in brains and implies that AIDA comprises generative probabilistic models for acoustic signals and user responses. We propose a novel generative model for acoustic signals as a sum of time-varying auto-regressive filters and a user response model based on a Gaussian Process Classifier. The full AIDA agent has been implemented in a factor graph for the generative model and all tasks (parameter learning, acoustic context classification, trial design, etc.) are realized by variational message passing on the factor graph.

The insula cortex, organized in hierarchical modules, is the major cortical region receiving interoceptive afferents and contains visceral topographic maps. Yet, the biological significance of the insula's modular architecture in relation to deep brain regions remains unsolved. In this opinion, we propose the Insula Hierarchical Modular Adaptive Interoception Control (IMAC) model to suggest that insula modules (granular, dysgranular and agranular subregions), forming networks with prefrontal (supplementary motor area, dorsolateral and ventromedial cortices) and striatum (posterior, dorsomedial and ventromedial) subregions, are specialized for higher-order interoceptive representations, recruited in a context-dependent manner to support habitual, model-based and exploratory adaptive behavior. We then discuss how insula interoceptive representations, or metaceptions, could give rise to conscious interoceptive feelings built up from low-order visceral representations and associated basic emotions located in deep interoceptive brain structures.", "authors": [{"name": "Alan S.

Up to now, the inference of the latent variables was carried out by taking advantage of the flexibility offered by Variational Message Passing (Winn and Bishop, 2005), an iterative process that can be understood as sending messages along the edges of a factor graph (Forney, 2001). In this paper, we harness the efficiency of an alternative method for inference called Bayesian Filtering (Fox et al., 2003), which does not require the iteration of the update equations until convergence of the Variational Free Energy. Instead, this scheme alternates between two phases: integration of evidence and prediction of future states. Both of those phases can be performed efficiently and this provides a seventy times speed up over the state-of-the-art.", "authors": [{"name": "Théophile Champion", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Marek Grześ", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Howard Bowman", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2021, "doi": null, "arxiv_id": "2112.07406", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2021-12-14"}

{"title": "Resonating Minds -- Emergent Collaboration Through Hierarchical Active Inference", "abstract": "Working together on complex collaborative tasks requires agents to coordinate their actions. Doing this explicitly or completely prior to the actual interaction is not always possible nor sufficient. Agents also need to continuously understand the current actions of others and quickly adapt their own behavior appropriately. Here we investigate how efficient, automatic coordination processes at the level of mental states (intentions, goals), which we call belief resonance, can lead to collaborative situated problem-solving. We present a model of hierarchical active inference for collaborative agents (HAICA). It combines efficient Bayesian Theory of Mind processes with a perception-action system based on predictive processing and active inference. Belief resonance is realized by letting the inferred mental states of one agent influence another agent's predictive beliefs about its own goals and intentions. This way, the inferred mental states influence the agent's own task behavior without explicit collaborative reasoning. We implement and evaluate this model in the Overcooked domain, in which two agents with varying degrees of belief resonance team up to fulfill meal orders. Our results demonstrate that agents based on HAICA achieve a team performance comparable to recent state of the art approaches, while incurring much lower computational costs. We also show that belief resonance is especially beneficial in settings were the agents have asymmetric knowledge about the environment. The results indicate that belief resonance and active inference allow for quick and efficient agent coordination, and thus can serve as a building block for collaborative cognitive agents.", "authors": [{"name": "Jan Pöppel", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Sebastian Kahl", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Stefan Kopp", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2021, "doi": "10.1007/s12559-021-09960-4", "arxiv_id": "2112.01210", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2021-12-02"}
{"title": "Branching Time Active Inference: empirical study and complexity class analysis", "abstract": "Active inference is a state-of-the-art framework for modelling the brain that explains a wide range of mechanisms such as habit formation, dopaminergic discharge and curiosity. However, recent implementations suffer from an exponential complexity class when computing the prior over all the possible policies up to the time horizon. Fountas et al (2020) used Monte Carlo tree search to address this problem, leading to very good results in two different tasks. Additionally, Champion et al (2021a) proposed a tree search approach based on (temporal) structure learning. This was enabled by the development of a variational message passing approach to active inference, which enables compositional construction of Bayesian networks for active inference. However, this message passing tree search approach, which we call branching-time active inference (BTAI), has never been tested empirically. In this paper, we present an experimental study of BTAI in the context of a maze solving agent. In this context, we show that both improved prior preferences and deeper search help mitigate the vulnerability to local minima. Then, we compare BTAI to standard active inference (AcI) on a graph navigation task. We show that for small graphs, both BTAI and AcI successfully solve the task. For larger graphs, AcI exhibits an exponential (space) complexity class, making the approach intractable. However, BTAI explores the space of policies more efficiently, successfully scaling to larger graphs. Then, BTAI was compared to the POMCP algorithm on the frozen lake environment. The experiments suggest that BTAI and the POMCP algorithm accumulate a similar amount of reward. Also, we describe when BTAI receives more rewards than the POMCP agent, and when the opposite is true. Finally, we compared BTAI to the approach of Fountas et al (2020) on the dSprites dataset, and we discussed the pros and cons of each approach.", "authors": [{"name": "Théophile Champion", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Howard Bowman", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Marek Grześ", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2021, "doi": null, "arxiv_id": "2111.11276", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2021-11-22"}

{"title": "Kalman filters as the steady-state solution of gradient descent on variational free energy", "abstract": "The Kalman filter is an algorithm for the estimation of hidden variables in dynamical systems under linear Gauss-Markov assumptions with widespread applications across different fields. Recently, its Bayesian interpretation has received a growing amount of attention especially in neuroscience, robotics and machine learning. In neuroscience, in particular, models of perception and control under the banners of predictive coding, optimal feedback control, active inference and more generally the so-called Bayesian brain hypothesis, have all heavily relied on ideas behind the Kalman filter. Active inference, an algorithmic theory based on the free energy principle, specifically builds on approximate Bayesian inference methods proposing a variational account of neural computation and behaviour in terms of gradients of variational free energy. Using this ambitious framework, several works have discussed different possible relations between free energy minimisation and standard Kalman filters. With a few exceptions, however, such relations point at a mere qualitative resemblance or are built on a set of very diverse comparisons based on purported differences between free energy minimisation and Kalman filtering. In this work, we present a straightforward derivation of Kalman filters consistent with active inference via a variational treatment of free energy minimisation in terms of gradient descent. The approach considered here offers a more direct link between models of neural dynamics as gradient descent and standard accounts of perception and decision making based on probabilistic inference, further bridging the gap between hypotheses about neural implementation and computational principles in brain and behavioural sciences.", "authors": [{"name": "M.

{"title": "Contrastive Active Inference", "abstract": "Active inference is a unifying theory for perception and action resting upon the idea that the brain maintains an internal model of the world by minimizing free energy. From a behavioral perspective, active inference agents can be seen as self-evidencing beings that act to fulfill their optimistic predictions, namely preferred outcomes or goals. In contrast, reinforcement learning requires human-designed rewards to accomplish any desired outcome. Although active inference could provide a more natural self-supervised objective for control, its applicability has been limited because of the shortcomings in scaling the approach to complex environments. In this work, we propose a contrastive objective for active inference that strongly reduces the computational burden in learning the agent's generative model and planning future actions. Our method performs notably better than likelihood-based active inference in image-based tasks, while also being computationally cheaper and easier to train. We compare to reinforcement learning agents that have access to human-designed reward functions, showing that our approach closely matches their performance. Finally, we also show that contrastive methods perform significantly better in the case of distractors in the environment and that our method is able to generalize goals to variations in the background.

{"title": "Active inference, Bayesian optimal design, and expected utility", "abstract": "Active inference, a corollary of the free energy principle, is a formal way of describing the behavior of certain kinds of random dynamical systems—that have the appearance of sentience. In this chapter, we describe how active inference combines Bayesian decision theory and optimal Bayesian design principles under a single imperative to minimize expected free energy. It is this aspect of active inference that allows for the natural emergence of information-seeking behavior. When removing prior outcomes preferences from expected free energy, active inference reduces to optimal Bayesian design, i.e., information gain maximization. Conversely, active inference reduces to Bayesian decision theory in the absence of ambiguity and relative risk, i.e., expected utility maximization.

In the majority of existing schemes, a binary decision of whether a sensor is healthy (functional) or faulty is made based on measured data. The decision boundary is called a threshold and it is usually deterministic. Following a faulty decision, fault recovery is obtained by excluding the malfunctioning sensor. We propose a stochastic fault-tolerant scheme based on active inference and precision learning which does not require a priori threshold definitions to trigger fault recovery. Instead, the sensor precision, which represents its health status, is learned online in a model-free way allowing the system to gradually, and not abruptly exclude a failing unit.

{"title": "Robot Localization and Navigation through Predictive Processing using LiDAR", "abstract": "Knowing the position of the robot in the world is crucial for navigation. Nowadays, Bayesian filters, such as Kalman and particle-based, are standard approaches in mobile robotics. Recently, end-to-end learning has allowed for scaling-up to high-dimensional inputs and improved generalization. However, there are still limitations to providing reliable laser navigation. Here we show a proof-of-concept of the predictive processing-inspired approach to perception applied for localization and navigation using laser sensors, without the need for odometry. We learn the generative model of the laser through self-supervised learning and perform both online state-estimation and navigation through stochastic gradient descent on the variational free-energy bound. We evaluated the algorithm on a mobile robot (TIAGo Base) with a laser sensor (SICK) in Gazebo. Results showed improved state-estimation performance when comparing to a state-of-the-art particle filter in the absence of odometry.

{"title": "Active Inference and Epistemic Value in Graphical Models", "abstract": "The Free Energy Principle (FEP) postulates that biological agents perceive and interact with their environment in order to minimize a Variational Free Energy (VFE) with respect to a generative model of their environment. The inference of a policy (future control sequence) according to the FEP is known as Active Inference (AIF). The AIF literature describes multiple VFE objectives for policy planning that lead to epistemic (information-seeking) behavior. However, most objectives have limited modeling flexibility. This paper approaches epistemic behavior from a constrained Bethe Free Energy (CBFE) perspective. Crucially, variational optimization of the CBFE can be expressed in terms of message passing on free-form generative models. The key intuition behind the CBFE is that we impose a point-mass constraint on predicted outcomes, which explicitly encodes the assumption that the agent will make observations in the future. We interpret the CBFE objective in terms of its constituent behavioral drives. We then illustrate resulting behavior of the CBFE by planning and interacting with a simulated T-maze environment. Simulations for the T-maze task illustrate how the CBFE agent exhibits an epistemic drive, and actively plans ahead to account for the impact of predicted outcomes. Compared to an EFE agent, the CBFE agent incurs expected reward in significantly more environmental scenarios.

{"title": "Active Inference for Stochastic Control", "abstract": "Active inference has emerged as an alternative approach to control problems given its intuitive (probabilistic) formalism. However, despite its theoretical utility, computational implementations have largely been restricted to low-dimensional, deterministic settings. This paper highlights that this is a consequence of the inability to adequately model stochastic transition dynamics, particularly when an extensive policy (i.e., action trajectory) space must be evaluated during planning. Fortunately, recent advancements propose a modified planning algorithm for finite temporal horizons. We build upon this work to assess the utility of active inference for a stochastic control setting. For this, we simulate the classic windy grid-world task with additional complexities, namely: 1) environment stochasticity; 2) learning of transition dynamics; and 3) partial observability. Our results demonstrate the advantage of using active inference, compared to reinforcement learning, in both deterministic and stochastic settings.", "authors": [{"name": "Aswin Paul", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Noor Sajid", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Manoj Gopalkrishnan", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Adeel Razi", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2021, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-93736-2_47", "arxiv_id": "2108.12245", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2021-08-27"}
{"title": "Disentangling What and Where for 3D Object-Centric Representations Through Active Inference", "abstract": "Although modern object detection and classification models achieve high accuracy, these are typically constrained in advance on a fixed train set and are therefore not flexible to deal with novel, unseen object categories. Moreover, these models most often operate on a single frame, which may yield incorrect classifications in case of ambiguous viewpoints. In this paper, we propose an active inference agent that actively gathers evidence for object classifications, and can learn novel object categories over time. Drawing inspiration from the human brain, we build object-centric generative models composed of two information streams, a what- and a where-stream. The what-stream predicts whether the observed object belongs to a specific category, while the where-stream is responsible for representing the object in its internal 3D reference frame. We show that our agent (i) is able to learn representations for many object categories in an unsupervised way, (ii) achieves state-of-the-art classification accuracies, actively resolving ambiguity when required and (iii) identifies novel object categories. Furthermore, we validate our system in an end-to-end fashion where the agent is able to search for an object at a given pose from a pixel-based rendering.

{"title": "A computational theory for the production of limb movements", "abstract": "Motor control is a fundamental process that underlies all voluntary behavioral responses. Several different theories based on different principles (task dynamics, equilibrium-point theory, passive-motion paradigm, active inference, optimal control) account for specific aspects of how actions are produced, but fail to provide a unified view on this problem. Here we propose a concise theory of motor control based on three principles: optimal feedback control, control with a receding time horizon, and task representation by a series of via-points updated at fixed frequency. By construction, the theory provides a suitable solution to the degrees-of-freedom problem, i.e. trajectory formation in the presence of redundancies and noise. We show through computer simulations that the theory also explains the production of discrete, continuous, rhythmic and temporally-constrained movements, and their parametric and statistical properties (scaling laws, power laws, speed/accuracy tradeoffs). The theory has no free parameters and only limited variations in its implementation details and in the nature of noise are necessary to guarantee its explanatory power.", "authors": [{"name": "Emmanuel Guigon", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2021, "doi": null, "arxiv_id": "2107.00814", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2021-07-02"}
{"title": "Applications of the Free Energy Principle to Machine Learning and Neuroscience", "abstract": "In this PhD thesis, we explore and apply methods inspired by the free energy principle to two important areas in machine learning and neuroscience. The free energy principle is a general mathematical theory of the necessary information-theoretic behaviours of systems that maintain a separation from their environment. A core postulate of the theory is that complex systems can be seen as performing variational Bayesian inference and minimizing an information-theoretic quantity called the variational free energy. The thesis is structured into three independent sections. Firstly, we focus on predictive coding, a neurobiologically plausible process theory derived from the free energy principle which argues that the primary function of the brain is to minimize prediction errors, showing how predictive coding can be scaled up and extended to be more biologically plausible, and elucidating its close links with other methods such as Kalman Filtering. Secondly, we study active inference, a neurobiologically grounded account of action through variational message passing, and investigate how these methods can be scaled up to match the performance of deep reinforcement learning methods. We additionally provide a detailed mathematical understanding of the nature and origin of the information-theoretic objectives that underlie exploratory behaviour. Finally, we investigate biologically plausible methods of credit assignment in the brain. We first demonstrate a close link between predictive coding and the backpropagation of error algorithm. We go on to propose novel and simpler algorithms which allow for backprop to be implemented in purely local, biologically plausible computations.", "authors": [{"name": "Beren Millidge", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2021, "doi": null, "arxiv_id": "2107.00140", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2021-06-30"}
{"title": "Bayesian Mechanics for Stationary Processes", "abstract": "This paper develops a Bayesian mechanics for adaptive systems. Firstly, we model the interface between a system and its environment with a Markov blanket. This affords conditions under which states internal to the blanket encode information about external states. Second, we introduce dynamics and represent adaptive systems as Markov blankets at steady-state. This allows us to identify a wide class of systems whose internal states appear to infer external states, consistent with variational inference in Bayesian statistics and theoretical neuroscience. Finally, we partition the blanket into sensory and active states. It follows that active states can be seen as performing active inference and well-known forms of stochastic control (such as PID control), which are prominent formulations of adaptive behaviour in theoretical biology and engineering.", "authors": [{"name": "Lancelot Da Costa", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Karl Friston", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Conor Heins", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Grigorios A.

{"title": "A Unified View of Algorithms for Path Planning Using Probabilistic Inference on Factor Graphs", "abstract": "Even if path planning can be solved using standard techniques from dynamic programming and control, the problem can also be approached using probabilistic inference. The algorithms that emerge using the latter framework bear some appealing characteristics that qualify the probabilistic approach as a powerful alternative to the more traditional control formulations. The idea of using estimation on stochastic models to solve control problems is not new and the inference approach considered here falls under the rubric of Active Inference (AI) and Control as Inference (CAI). In this work, we look at the specific recursions that arise from various cost functions that, although they may appear similar in scope, bear noticeable differences, at least when applied to typical path planning problems. We start by posing the path planning problem on a probabilistic factor graph, and show how the various algorithms translate into specific message composition rules. We then show how this unified approach, presented both in probability space and in log space, provides a very general framework that includes the Sum-product, the Max-product, Dynamic programming and mixed Reward/Entropy criteria-based algorithms. The framework also expands algorithmic design options for smoother or sharper policy distributions, including generalized Sum/Max-product algorithm, a Smooth Dynamic programming algorithm and modified versions of the Reward/Entropy recursions. We provide a comprehensive table of recursions and a comparison through simulations, first on a synthetic small grid with a single goal with obstacles, and then on a grid extrapolated from a real-world scene with multiple goals and a semantic map.", "authors": [{"name": "Francesco A.

Habitual behavior, which is obtained from the prior distribution of ${z}$, is acquired by reinforcement learning. Goal-directed behavior is determined from the posterior distribution of ${z}$ by planning, using active inference which optimizes the past, current and future ${z}$ by minimizing the variational free energy for the desired future observation constrained by the observed sensory sequence.

{"title": "Online reinforcement learning with sparse rewards through an active inference capsule", "abstract": "Intelligent agents must pursue their goals in complex environments with partial information and often limited computational capacity. Reinforcement learning methods have achieved great success by creating agents that optimize engineered reward functions, but which often struggle to learn in sparse-reward environments, generally require many environmental interactions to perform well, and are typically computationally very expensive. Active inference is a model-based approach that directs agents to explore uncertain states while adhering to a prior model of their goal behaviour. This paper introduces an active inference agent which minimizes the novel free energy of the expected future. Our model is capable of solving sparse-reward problems with a very high sample efficiency due to its objective function, which encourages directed exploration of uncertain states. Moreover, our model is computationally very light and can operate in a fully online manner while achieving comparable performance to offline RL methods. We showcase the capabilities of our model by solving the mountain car problem, where we demonstrate its superior exploration properties and its robustness to observation noise, which in fact improves performance.

To this end, the decision-making agent probes a subset of processes at every time instant and obtains a potentially erroneous estimate of the binary variable which indicates whether or not the corresponding process is anomalous. The agent continues to probe the processes until it obtains a sufficient number of measurements to reliably identify the anomalous processes. In this context, we develop a sequential selection algorithm that decides which processes to be probed at every instant to detect the anomalies with an accuracy exceeding a desired value while minimizing the delay in making the decision and the total number of measurements taken. Our algorithm is based on active inference which is a general framework to make sequential decisions in order to maximize the notion of free energy. We define the free energy using the objectives of the selection policy and implement the active inference framework using a deep neural network approximation.

{"title": "Trust as Extended Control: Active Inference and User Feedback During Human-Robot Collaboration", "abstract": "To interact seamlessly with robots, users must infer the causes of a robot's behavior and be confident about that inference. Hence, trust is a necessary condition for human-robot collaboration (HRC). Despite its crucial role, it is largely unknown how trust emerges, develops, and supports human interactions with nonhuman artefacts. Here, we review the literature on trust, human-robot interaction, human-robot collaboration, and human interaction at large. Early models of trust suggest that trust entails a trade-off between benevolence and competence, while studies of human-to-human interaction emphasize the role of shared behavior and mutual knowledge in the gradual building of trust. We then introduce a model of trust as an agent's best explanation for reliable sensory exchange with an extended motor plant or partner. This model is based on the cognitive neuroscience of active inference and suggests that, in the context of HRC, trust can be cast in terms of virtual control over an artificial agent. In this setting, interactive feedback becomes a necessary component of the trustor's perception-action cycle. The resulting model has important implications for understanding human-robot interaction and collaboration, as it allows the traditional determinants of human trust to be defined in terms of active inference, information exchange and empowerment. Furthermore, this model suggests that boredom and surprise may be used as markers for under and over-reliance on the system. Finally, we examine the role of shared behavior in the genesis of trust, especially in the context of dyadic collaboration, suggesting important consequences for the acceptability and design of human-robot collaborative systems.", "authors": [{"name": "Felix Schoeller", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Mark Miller", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Roy Salomon", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Karl J.

{"title": "An active inference model of collective intelligence", "abstract": "To date, formal models of collective intelligence have lacked a plausible mathematical description of the relationship between local-scale interactions between highly autonomous sub-system components (individuals) and global-scale behavior of the composite system (the collective). In this paper we use the Active Inference Formulation (AIF), a framework for explaining the behavior of any non-equilibrium steady state system at any scale, to posit a minimal agent-based model that simulates the relationship between local individual-level interaction and collective intelligence (operationalized as system-level performance). We explore the effects of providing baseline AIF agents (Model 1) with specific cognitive capabilities: Theory of Mind (Model 2); Goal Alignment (Model 3), and Theory of Mind with Goal Alignment (Model 4). These stepwise transitions in sophistication of cognitive ability are motivated by the types of advancements plausibly required for an AIF agent to persist and flourish in an environment populated by other AIF agents, and have also recently been shown to map naturally to canonical steps in human cognitive ability. Illustrative results show that stepwise cognitive transitions increase system performance by providing complementary mechanisms for alignment between agents' local and global optima. Alignment emerges endogenously from the dynamics of interacting AIF agents themselves, rather than being imposed exogenously by incentives to agents' behaviors (contra existing computational models of collective intelligence) or top-down priors for collective behavior (contra existing multiscale simulations of AIF). These results shed light on the types of generic information-theoretic patterns conducive to collective intelligence in human and other complex adaptive systems.", "authors": [{"name": "Rafael Kaufmann", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Pranav Gupta", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Jacob Taylor", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2021, "doi": "10.3390/e23070830", "arxiv_id": "2104.01066", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2021-04-02"}
{"title": "Active Inference Tree Search in Large POMDPs", "abstract": "The ability to plan ahead efficiently is key for both living organisms and artificial systems. Model-based planning and prospection are widely studied in cognitive neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI), but from different perspectives--and with different desiderata in mind (biological realism versus scalability) that are difficult to reconcile. Here, we introduce a novel method to plan in POMDPs--Active Inference Tree Search (AcT)--that combines the normative character and biological realism of a leading planning theory in neuroscience (Active Inference) and the scalability of tree search methods in AI. This unification enhances both approaches. On the one hand, tree searches enable the biologically grounded, first principle method of active inference to be applied to large-scale problems. On the other hand, active inference provides a principled solution to the exploration-exploitation dilemma, which is often addressed heuristically in tree search methods. Our simulations show that AcT successfully navigates binary trees that are challenging for sampling-based methods, problems that require adaptive exploration, and the large POMDP problem 'RockSample'--in which AcT reproduces state-of-the-art POMDP solutions. Furthermore, we illustrate how AcT can be used to simulate neurophysiological responses (e.g., in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex) of humans and other animals that solve large planning problems.

In a set of simulation studies, we examine dyadic imitative interactions of robots using a variational recurrent neural network model.

We examined how regulating the complexity term to minimize free energy determines the dynamic characteristics of networks and interactions. When one robot trained with tighter regulation and another trained with looser regulation interact, the latter tends to lead the interaction by exerting stronger action intention, while the former tends to follow by adapting to its observations.

{"title": "Chance-Constrained Active Inference", "abstract": "Abstract Active inference (ActInf) is an emerging theory that explains perception and action in biological agents in terms of minimizing a free energy bound on Bayesian surprise. Goal-directed behavior is elicited by introducing prior beliefs on the underlying generative model. In contrast to prior beliefs, which constrain all realizations of a random variable, we propose an alternative approach through chance constraints, which allow for a (typically small) probability of constraint violation, and demonstrate how such constraints can be used as intrinsic drivers for goal-directed behavior in ActInf. We illustrate how chance-constrained ActInf weights all imposed (prior) constraints on the generative model, allowing, for example, for a trade-off between robust control and empirical chance constraint violation. Second, we interpret the proposed solution within a message passing framework. Interestingly, the message passing interpretation is not only relevant to the context of ActInf, but also provides a general-purpose approach that can account for chance constraints on graphical models. The chance constraint message updates can then be readily combined with other prederived message update rules without the need for custom derivations. The proposed chance-constrained message passing framework thus accelerates the search for workable models in general and can be used to complement message-passing formulations on generative neural models.", "authors": [{"name": "T.

{"title": "Prior Preference Learning from Experts:Designing a Reward with Active Inference", "abstract": "Active inference may be defined as Bayesian modeling of a brain with a biologically plausible model of the agent. Its primary idea relies on the free energy principle and the prior preference of the agent. An agent will choose an action that leads to its prior preference for a future observation. In this paper, we claim that active inference can be interpreted using reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms and find a theoretical connection between them. We extend the concept of expected free energy (EFE), which is a core quantity in active inference, and claim that EFE can be treated as a negative value function. Motivated by the concept of prior preference and a theoretical connection, we propose a simple but novel method for learning a prior preference from experts. This illustrates that the problem with inverse RL can be approached with a new perspective of active inference. Experimental results of prior preference learning show the possibility of active inference with EFE-based rewards and its application to an inverse RL problem.", "authors": [{"name": "Jin young Shin", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Cheolhyeong Kim", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Hyung Ju Hwang", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2021, "doi": null, "arxiv_id": "2101.08937", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2021-01-22"}
{"title": "An empirical evaluation of active inference in multi-armed bandits", "abstract": "A key feature of sequential decision making under uncertainty is a need to balance between exploiting--choosing the best action according to the current knowledge, and exploring--obtaining information about values of other actions. The multi-armed bandit problem, a classical task that captures this trade-off, served as a vehicle in machine learning for developing bandit algorithms that proved to be useful in numerous industrial applications. The active inference framework, an approach to sequential decision making recently developed in neuroscience for understanding human and animal behaviour, is distinguished by its sophisticated strategy for resolving the exploration-exploitation trade-off. This makes active inference an exciting alternative to already established bandit algorithms. Here we derive an efficient and scalable approximate active inference algorithm and compare it to two state-of-the-art bandit algorithms: Bayesian upper confidence bound and optimistic Thompson sampling. This comparison is done on two types of bandit problems: a stationary and a dynamic switching bandit. Our empirical evaluation shows that the active inference algorithm does not produce efficient long-term behaviour in stationary bandits. However, in the more challenging switching bandit problem active inference performs substantially better than the two state-of-the-art bandit algorithms. The results open exciting venues for further research in theoretical and applied machine learning, as well as lend additional credibility to active inference as a general framework for studying human and animal behaviour.", "authors": [{"name": "Dimitrije Markovic", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Hrvoje Stojic", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Sarah Schwoebel", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Stefan J.

{"title": "Predictive Processing in Cognitive Robotics: a Review", "abstract": "Predictive processing has become an influential framework in cognitive sciences. This framework turns the traditional view of perception upside down, claiming that the main flow of information processing is realized in a top-down hierarchical manner. Furthermore, it aims at unifying perception, cognition, and action as a single inferential process. However, in the related literature, the predictive processing framework and its associated schemes such as predictive coding, active inference, perceptual inference, free-energy principle, tend to be used interchangeably. In the field of cognitive robotics there is no clear-cut distinction on which schemes have been implemented and under which assumptions. In this paper, working definitions are set with the main aim of analyzing the state of the art in cognitive robotics research working under the predictive processing framework as well as some related non-robotic models. The analysis suggests that, first, both research in cognitive robotics implementations and non-robotic models needs to be extended to the study of how multiple exteroceptive modalities can be integrated into prediction error minimization schemes. Second, a relevant distinction found here is that cognitive robotics implementations tend to emphasize the learning of a generative model, while in non-robotics models it is almost absent. Third, despite the relevance for active inference, few cognitive robotics implementations examine the issues around control and whether it should result from the substitution of inverse models with proprioceptive predictions. Finally, limited attention has been placed on precision weighting and the tracking of prediction error dynamics. These mechanisms should help to explore more complex behaviors and tasks in cognitive robotics research under the predictive processing framework.", "authors": [{"name": "Alejandra Ciria", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Guido Schillaci", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Giovanni Pezzulo", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Verena V.

{"title": "Active Inference and Behavior Trees for Reactive Action Planning and Execution in Robotics", "abstract": "We propose a hybrid combination of active inference and behavior trees (BTs) for reactive action planning and execution in dynamic environments, showing how robotic tasks can be formulated as a free-energy minimization problem. The proposed approach allows handling partially observable initial states and improves the robustness of classical BTs against unexpected contingencies while at the same time reducing the number of nodes in a tree. In this work, we specify the nominal behavior offline, through BTs. However, in contrast to previous approaches, we introduce a new type of leaf node to specify the desired state to be achieved rather than an action to execute. The decision of which action to execute to reach the desired state is performed online through active inference. This results in continual online planning and hierarchical deliberation. By doing so, an agent can follow a predefined offline plan while still keeping the ability to locally adapt and take autonomous decisions at runtime, respecting safety constraints. We provide proof of convergence and robustness analysis, and we validate our method in two different mobile manipulators performing similar tasks, both in a simulated and real retail environment.

{"title": "Episodic Memory for Learning Subjective-Timescale Models", "abstract": "In model-based learning, an agent's model is commonly defined over transitions between consecutive states of an environment even though planning often requires reasoning over multi-step timescales, with intermediate states either unnecessary, or worse, accumulating prediction error. In contrast, intelligent behaviour in biological organisms is characterised by the ability to plan over varying temporal scales depending on the context. Inspired by the recent works on human time perception, we devise a novel approach to learning a transition dynamics model, based on the sequences of episodic memories that define the agent's subjective timescale - over which it learns world dynamics and over which future planning is performed. We implement this in the framework of active inference and demonstrate that the resulting subjective-timescale model (STM) can systematically vary the temporal extent of its predictions while preserving the same computational efficiency. Additionally, we show that STM predictions are more likely to introduce future salient events (for example new objects coming into view), incentivising exploration of new areas of the environment. As a result, STM produces more informative action-conditioned roll-outs that assist the agent in making better decisions.

{"title": "Reward Maximisation through Discrete Active Inference", "abstract": "Active inference is a probabilistic framework for modelling the behaviour of biological and artificial agents, which derives from the principle of minimising free energy. In recent years, this framework has successfully been applied to a variety of situations where the goal was to maximise reward, offering comparable and sometimes superior performance to alternative approaches. In this paper, we clarify the connection between reward maximisation and active inference by demonstrating how and when active inference agents perform actions that are optimal for maximising reward. Precisely, we show the conditions under which active inference produces the optimal solution to the Bellman equation--a formulation that underlies several approaches to model-based reinforcement learning and control. On partially observed Markov decision processes, the standard active inference scheme can produce Bellman optimal actions for planning horizons of 1, but not beyond. In contrast, a recently developed recursive active inference scheme (sophisticated inference) can produce Bellman optimal actions on any finite temporal horizon.

However, current models are limited to fully observable domains. In this paper, we describe a deep active inference model that can learn successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs. The deep learning architecture optimizes a variant of the expected free energy and encodes the continuous state representation by means of a variational autoencoder. We show, in the OpenAI benchmark, that our approach has comparable or better performance than deep Q-learning, a state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithm.", "authors": [{"name": "Otto van der Himst", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Pablo Lanillos", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-64919-7_8", "arxiv_id": "2009.03622", "s2_id": "931781af3b6797d5abe3aa2537f4f46fd4fdf3ef", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "International Workshop on Affective Interactions", "citation_count": 28, "references": ["s2:e5d0bae3642eccdd0ba90c43c4c0ed4a174c2b64", "s2:67c6eb9de9aab00ee4e8da7c83a47899f0205ae8", "s2:4376776a04e0f999b675f8eb9cff6ebd5d90aa6a", "s2:6abff55c56cbde182a85bbdbbf7a4262d06de4ca", "s2:0f1440184094a1fc3483fbc2d36eae2e1c88851d", "s2:a951a731ef3ab06f3961a6ffabf49249fae32cae", "s2:def8207fb6457f3c2656bac9f2bbf954de1d7de1", "s2:1dc4001974f99122610964b3731882cca9c228a0", "s2:e09f6b0ddee0f7cfd1a7e2d56899f2d8d8774e77", "s2:c219439493dc8a95331516995e64d5726f241d72", "s2:498238a3bd5fd322fc3ce1572e33bbe3853a356f", "s2:f5f323e62acb75f785e00b4c90ace16f1690076f", "s2:340f48901f72278f6bf78a04ee5b01df208cc508", "s2:2319a491378867c7049b3da055c5df60e1671158", "s2:17b7e0b33847ca1c0546f714b75bdd768263b267", "s2:42998f6a0ef243ffb5555ced81319ea5e8bba788", "s2:407bb3034daac0fb4fba3d4c09ef3a26dfbfcf5f", "s2:1ed6a4a10589618d4f26350f1a296ee767ceff6b", "s2:c09fb7cfa28cde7ab254f878a5987758b8c5f4d0"], "publication_date": null}

{"title": "Bayesian mechanics of perceptual inference and motor control in the brain", "abstract": "The free energy principle (FEP) in the neurosciences stipulates that all viable agents induce and minimize informational free energy in the brain to fit their environmental niche. In this study, we continue our effort to make the FEP a more physically principled formalism by implementing free energy minimization based on the principle of least action. We build a Bayesian mechanics (BM) by casting the formulation reported in the earlier publication (Kim in Neural Comput 30:2616–2659, 2018, https://doi.org/10.1162/neco_a_01115) to considering active inference beyond passive perception. The BM is a neural implementation of variational Bayes under the FEP in continuous time. The resulting BM is provided as an effective Hamilton’s equation of motion and subject to the control signal arising from the brain’s prediction errors at the proprioceptive level.

{"title": "Abstracting Deep Neural Networks into Concept Graphs for Concept Level Interpretability", "abstract": "The black-box nature of deep learning models prevents them from being completely trusted in domains like biomedicine. Most explainability techniques do not capture the concept-based reasoning that human beings follow. In this work, we attempt to understand the behavior of trained models that perform image processing tasks in the medical domain by building a graphical representation of the concepts they learn. Extracting such a graphical representation of the model's behavior on an abstract, higher conceptual level would unravel the learnings of these models and would help us to evaluate the steps taken by the model for predictions. We show the application of our proposed implementation on two biomedical problems - brain tumor segmentation and fundus image classification. We provide an alternative graphical representation of the model by formulating a concept level graph as discussed above, which makes the problem of intervention to find active inference trails more tractable. Understanding these trails would provide an understanding of the hierarchy of the decision-making process followed by the model. [As well as overall nature of model].

{"title": "Neural and phenotypic representation under the free-energy principle", "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to leverage the free-energy principle and its corollary process theory, active inference, to develop a generic, generalizable model of the representational capacities of living creatures; that is, a theory of phenotypic representation. Given their ubiquity, we are concerned with distributed forms of representation (e.g., population codes), whereby patterns of ensemble activity in living tissue come to represent the causes of sensory input or data. The active inference framework rests on the Markov blanket formalism, which allows us to partition systems of interest, such as biological systems, into internal states, external states, and the blanket (active and sensory) states that render internal and external states conditionally independent of each other. In this framework, the representational capacity of living creatures emerges as a consequence of their Markovian structure and nonequilibrium dynamics, which together entail a dual-aspect information geometry. This entails a modest representational capacity: internal states have an intrinsic information geometry that describes their trajectory over time in state space, as well as an extrinsic information geometry that allows internal states to encode (the parameters of) probabilistic beliefs about (fictive) external states. Building on this, we describe here how, in an automatic and emergent manner, information about stimuli can come to be encoded by groups of neurons bound by a Markov blanket; what is known as the neuronal packet hypothesis. As a concrete demonstration of this type of emergent representation, we present numerical simulations showing that self-organizing ensembles of active inference agents sharing the right kind of probabilistic generative model are able to encode recoverable information about a stimulus array.", "authors": [{"name": "Maxwell J.

{"title": "Modulation of viability signals for self-regulatory control", "abstract": "We revisit the role of instrumental value as a driver of adaptive behavior. In active inference, instrumental or extrinsic value is quantified by the information-theoretic surprisal of a set of observations measuring the extent to which those observations conform to prior beliefs or preferences. That is, an agent is expected to seek the type of evidence that is consistent with its own model of the world. For reinforcement learning tasks, the distribution of preferences replaces the notion of reward. We explore a scenario in which the agent learns this distribution in a self-supervised manner. In particular, we highlight the distinction between observations induced by the environment and those pertaining more directly to the continuity of an agent in time. We evaluate our methodology in a dynamic environment with discrete time and actions.

{"title": "Is the Free-Energy Principle a Formal Theory of Semantics? From Variational Density Dynamics to Neural and Phenotypic Representations", "abstract": "The aim of this paper is twofold: (1) to assess whether the construct of neural representations plays an explanatory role under the variational free-energy principle and its corollary process theory, active inference; and (2) if so, to assess which philosophical stance—in relation to the ontological and epistemological status of representations—is most appropriate. We focus on non-realist (deflationary and fictionalist-instrumentalist) approaches. We consider a deflationary account of mental representation, according to which the explanatorily relevant contents of neural representations are mathematical, rather than cognitive, and a fictionalist or instrumentalist account, according to which representations are scientifically useful fictions that serve explanatory (and other) aims. After reviewing the free-energy principle and active inference, we argue that the model of adaptive phenotypes under the free-energy principle can be used to furnish a formal semantics, enabling us to assign semantic content to specific phenotypic states (the internal states of a Markovian system that exists far from equilibrium). We propose a modified fictionalist account—an organism-centered fictionalism or instrumentalism. We argue that, under the free-energy principle, pursuing even a deflationary account of the content of neural representations licenses the appeal to the kind of semantic content involved in the ‘aboutness’ or intentionality of cognitive systems; our position is thus coherent with, but rests on distinct assumptions from, the realist position. We argue that the free-energy principle thereby explains the aboutness or intentionality in living systems and hence their capacity to parse their sensory stream using an ontology or set of semantic factors.", "authors": [{"name": "Maxwell Ramstead", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Karl J.

{"title": "Learning intuitive physics and one-shot imitation using state-action-prediction self-organizing maps", "abstract": "Human learning and intelligence work differently from the supervised pattern recognition approach adopted in most deep learning architectures. Humans seem to learn rich representations by exploration and imitation, build causal models of the world, and use both to flexibly solve new tasks. We suggest a simple but effective unsupervised model which develops such characteristics. The agent learns to represent the dynamical physical properties of its environment by intrinsically motivated exploration, and performs inference on this representation to reach goals. For this, a set of self-organizing maps which represent state-action pairs is combined with a causal model for sequence prediction. The proposed system is evaluated in the cartpole environment. After an initial phase of playful exploration, the agent can execute kinematic simulations of the environment's future, and use those for action planning. We demonstrate its performance on a set of several related, but different one-shot imitation tasks, which the agent flexibly solves in an active inference style.", "authors": [{"name": "Martin Stetter", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Elmar W.

{"title": "End-Effect Exploration Drive for Effective Motor Learning", "abstract": "Stemming on the idea that a key objective in reinforcement learning is to invert a target distribution of effects, end-effect drives are proposed as an effective way to implement goal-directed motor learning, in the absence of an explicit forward model. An end-effect model relies on a simple statistical recording of the effect of the current policy, here used as a substitute for the more resource-demanding forward models. When combined with a reward structure, it forms the core of a lightweight variational free energy minimization setup. The main difficulty lies in the maintenance of this simplified effect model together with the online update of the policy. When the prior target distribution is uniform, it provides a ways to learn an efficient exploration policy, consistently with the intrinsic curiosity principles. When combined with an extrinsic reward, our approach is finally shown to provide a faster training than traditional off-policy techniques.", "authors": [{"name": "Emmanuel Daucé", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2020, "doi": null, "arxiv_id": "2006.15960", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2020-06-29"}
{"title": "A Hybrid Human-Neurorobotics Approach to Primary Intersubjectivity via Active Inference", "abstract": "Interdisciplinary efforts from developmental psychology, phenomenology, and philosophy of mind, have studied the rudiments of social cognition and conceptualized distinct forms of intersubjective communication and interaction at human early life. Interaction theorists consider primary intersubjectivity a non-mentalist, pre-theoretical, non-conceptual sort of processes that ground a certain level of communication and understanding, and provide support to higher-level cognitive skills. We argue the study of human/neurorobot interaction consists in a unique opportunity to deepen understanding of underlying mechanisms in social cognition through synthetic modeling, while allowing to examine a second person experiential (2PP) access to intersubjectivity in embodied dyadic interaction. Concretely, we propose the study of primary intersubjectivity as a 2PP experience characterized by predictive engagement, where perception, cognition, and action are accounted for an hermeneutic circle in dyadic interaction. From our interpretation of the concept of active inference in free-energy principle theory, we propose an open-source methodology named neural robotics library (NRL) for experimental human/neurorobot interaction, wherein a demonstration program named virtual Cartesian robot (VCBot) provides an opportunity to experience the aforementioned embodied interaction to general audiences. Lastly, through a study case, we discuss some ways human-robot primary intersubjectivity can contribute to cognitive science research, such as to the fields of developmental psychology, educational technology, and cognitive rehabilitation.", "authors": [{"name": "Hendry Ferreira Chame", "affiliation": "Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University", "orcid": "0000-0002-6293-8198"}, {"name": "Ahmadreza Ahmadi", "affiliation": "Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University", "orcid": "0000-0003-0084-2454"}, {"name": "Jun Tani", "affiliation": "Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University", "orcid": "0000-0002-9131-9206"}], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.3389/fpsyg.2020.584869", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W3037390745", "venue": "Frontiers in Psychology", "citation_count": 10, "references": ["openalex:W2429640", "openalex:W6335707", "openalex:W14246085", "openalex:W112879259", "openalex:W151798663", "openalex:W178269510", "openalex:W379488513", "openalex:W620953717", "openalex:W1499440702", "openalex:W1514615434", "openalex:W1522301498", "openalex:W1522588346", "openalex:W1528946842", "openalex:W1541753613", "openalex:W1547956127", "openalex:W1548991402", "openalex:W1596437901", "openalex:W1603091009", "openalex:W1619042684", "openalex:W1661662646", "openalex:W1709301467", "openalex:W1766531844", "openalex:W1815090327", "openalex:W1822080975", "openalex:W1895881709", "openalex:W1931752723", "openalex:W1966089223", "openalex:W1969140852", "openalex:W1987589084", "openalex:W1987789700", "openalex:W1989974095", "openalex:W2004652753", "openalex:W2014585840", "openalex:W2024149692", "openalex:W2025384592", "openalex:W2025412857", "openalex:W2028418738", "openalex:W2029008297", "openalex:W2030802915", "openalex:W2032624985", "openalex:W2037579017", "openalex:W2041533382", "openalex:W2045403074", "openalex:W2049897179", "openalex:W2056208132", "openalex:W2078088844", "openalex:W2079313625", "openalex:W2080749096", "openalex:W2089029564", "openalex:W2093466600", "openalex:W2097714468", "openalex:W2098533845", "openalex:W2105335341", "openalex:W2107911338", "openalex:W2111947800", "openalex:W2113669408", "openalex:W2114672579", "openalex:W2120536867", "openalex:W2124848740", "openalex:W2125636457", "openalex:W2128160875", "openalex:W2130195834", "openalex:W2132960888", "openalex:W2133520183", "openalex:W2135252493", "openalex:W2141538250", "openalex:W2148764920", "openalex:W2155352776", "openalex:W2158068330", "openalex:W2161868780", "openalex:W2162550962", "openalex:W2274124526", "openalex:W2320336678", "openalex:W2343361097", "openalex:W2397253692", "openalex:W2507615529", "openalex:W2509848167", "openalex:W2553496799", "openalex:W2558206955", "openalex:W2564601941", "openalex:W2566467910", "openalex:W2573894086", "openalex:W2600667840", "openalex:W2746602586", "openalex:W2791067024", "openalex:W2793764002", "openalex:W2795728764", "openalex:W2806801289", "openalex:W2890250492", "openalex:W2895707480", "openalex:W2898063841", "openalex:W2904347966", "openalex:W2956601432", "openalex:W2960133348", "openalex:W2965517028", "openalex:W2974745023", "openalex:W2987803397", "openalex:W2996202006", "openalex:W2999262696", "openalex:W3004214476", "openalex:W3005298015", "openalex:W3012394466", "openalex:W3012483393", "openalex:W3036603349", "openalex:W3048438965", "openalex:W3091705185", "openalex:W3101413036", "openalex:W3163890354", "openalex:W3183224878", "openalex:W3217611625", "openalex:W4205714513", "openalex:W4210893279", "openalex:W4233071312", "openalex:W4239037092", "openalex:W4247883378", "openalex:W4248489348", "openalex:W4248926310", "openalex:W4253717004", "openalex:W4255840631", "openalex:W4301141993", "openalex:W6604601558", "openalex:W6628908869", "openalex:W6631190155", "openalex:W6634774001", "openalex:W6739552150", "openalex:W6755392121", "openalex:W6757637850", "openalex:W6771633057", "openalex:W6780136960", "openalex:W6806534442", "openalex:W7017567752"], "publication_date": null}

{"title": "Deep active inference agents using Monte-Carlo methods", "abstract": "Active inference is a Bayesian framework for understanding biological intelligence. The underlying theory brings together perception and action under one single imperative: minimizing free energy. However, despite its theoretical utility in explaining intelligence, computational implementations have been restricted to low-dimensional and idealized situations. In this paper, we present a neural architecture for building deep active inference agents operating in complex, continuous state-spaces using multiple forms of Monte-Carlo (MC) sampling. For this, we introduce a number of techniques, novel to active inference. These include: i) selecting free-energy-optimal policies via MC tree search, ii) approximating this optimal policy distribution via a feed-forward `habitual' network, iii) predicting future parameter belief updates using MC dropouts and, finally, iv) optimizing state transition precision (a high-end form of attention). Our approach enables agents to learn environmental dynamics efficiently, while maintaining task performance, in relation to reward-based counterparts. We illustrate this in a new toy environment, based on the dSprites data-set, and demonstrate that active inference agents automatically create disentangled representations that are apt for modeling state transitions. In a more complex Animal-AI environment, our agents (using the same neural architecture) are able to simulate future state transitions and actions (i.e., plan), to evince reward-directed navigation - despite temporary suspension of visual input. These results show that deep active inference - equipped with MC methods - provides a flexible framework to develop biologically-inspired intelligent agents, with applications in both machine learning and cognitive science.", "authors": [{"name": "Z.

{"title": "Sophisticated Inference", "abstract": "Active inference offers a first principle account of sentient behaviour, from which special and important cases can be derived, e.g., reinforcement learning, active learning, Bayes optimal inference, Bayes optimal design, etc. Active inference resolves the exploitation-exploration dilemma in relation to prior preferences, by placing information gain on the same footing as reward or value. In brief, active inference replaces value functions with functionals of (Bayesian) beliefs, in the form of an expected (variational) free energy. In this paper, we consider a sophisticated kind of active inference, using a recursive form of expected free energy. Sophistication describes the degree to which an agent has beliefs about beliefs. We consider agents with beliefs about the counterfactual consequences of action for states of affairs and beliefs about those latent states. In other words, we move from simply considering beliefs about 'what would happen if I did that' to 'what would I believe about what would happen if I did that'. The recursive form of the free energy functional effectively implements a deep tree search over actions and outcomes in the future. Crucially, this search is over sequences of belief states, as opposed to states per se. We illustrate the competence of this scheme, using numerical simulations of deep decision problems.", "authors": [{"name": "Karl Friston", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Lancelot Da Costa", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Danijar Hafner", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Casper Hesp", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Thomas Parr", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2020, "doi": null, "arxiv_id": "2006.04120", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2020-06-07"}
{"title": "Goal-Directed Planning for Habituated Agents by Active Inference Using a Variational Recurrent Neural Network", "abstract": "It is crucial to ask how agents can achieve goals by generating action plans using only partial models of the world acquired through habituated sensory-motor experiences. Although many existing robotics studies use a forward model framework, there are generalization issues with high degrees of freedom. The current study shows that the predictive coding (PC) and active inference (AIF) frameworks, which employ a generative model, can develop better generalization by learning a prior distribution in a low dimensional latent state space representing probabilistic structures extracted from well habituated sensory-motor trajectories. In our proposed model, learning is carried out by inferring optimal latent variables as well as synaptic weights for maximizing the evidence lower bound, while goal-directed planning is accomplished by inferring latent variables for maximizing the estimated lower bound. Our proposed model was evaluated with both simple and complex robotic tasks in simulation, which demonstrated sufficient generalization in learning with limited training data by setting an intermediate value for a regularization coefficient. Furthermore, comparative simulation results show that the proposed model outperforms a conventional forward model in goal-directed planning, due to the learned prior confining the search of motor plans within the range of habituated trajectories.", "authors": [{"name": "Takazumi Matsumoto", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Jun Tani", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.3390/e22050564", "arxiv_id": "2005.14656", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2020-05-27"}
{"title": "On Kalman-Bucy filters, linear quadratic control and active inference", "abstract": "Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control is a framework first introduced in control theory that provides an optimal solution to linear problems of regulation in the presence of uncertainty. This framework combines Kalman-Bucy filters for the estimation of hidden states with Linear Quadratic Regulators for the control of their dynamics. Nowadays, LQG is also a common paradigm in neuroscience, where it is used to characterise different approaches to sensorimotor control based on state estimators, forward and inverse models. According to this paradigm, perception can be seen as a process of Bayesian inference and action as a process of optimal control. Recently, active inference has been introduced as a process theory derived from a variational approximation of Bayesian inference problems that describes, among others, perception and action in terms of (variational and expected) free energy minimisation. Active inference relies on a mathematical formalism similar to LQG, but offers a rather different perspective on problems of sensorimotor control in biological systems based on a process of biased perception. In this note we compare the mathematical treatments of these two frameworks for linear systems, focusing on their respective assumptions and highlighting their commonalities and technical differences.", "authors": [{"name": "Manuel Baltieri", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "C.

{"title": "Active Inference for Integrated State-Estimation, Control, and Learning", "abstract": "This work presents an approach for control, state-estimation and learning model (hyper)parameters for robotic manipulators. It is based on the active inference framework, prominent in computational neuroscience as a theory of the brain, where behaviour arises from minimizing variational free-energy. The robotic manipulator shows adaptive and robust behaviour compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we show the exact relationship to classic methods such as PID control. Finally, we show that by learning a temporal parameter and model variances, our approach can deal with unmodelled dynamics, damps oscillations, and is robust against disturbances and poor initial parameters. The approach is validated on the `Franka Emika Panda' 7 DoF manipulator.", "authors": [{"name": "Mohamed Baioumy", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Paul Duckworth", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Bruno Lacerda", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Nick Hawes", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2020, "doi": null, "arxiv_id": "2005.05894", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2020-05-12"}
{"title": "The two kinds of free energy and the Bayesian revolution", "abstract": "The concept of free energy has its origins in 19th century thermodynamics, but has recently found its way into the behavioral and neural sciences, where it has been promoted for its wide applicability and has even been suggested as a fundamental principle of understanding intelligent behavior and brain function. We argue that there are essentially two different notions of free energy in current models of intelligent agency, that can both be considered as applications of Bayesian inference to the problem of action selection: one that appears when trading off accuracy and uncertainty based on a general maximum entropy principle, and one that formulates action selection in terms of minimizing an error measure that quantifies deviations of beliefs and policies from given reference models. The first approach provides a normative rule for action selection in the face of model uncertainty or when information processing capabilities are limited. The second approach directly aims to formulate the action selection problem as an inference problem in the context of Bayesian brain theories, also known as Active Inference in the literature. We elucidate the main ideas and discuss critical technical and conceptual issues revolving around these two notions of free energy that both claim to apply at all levels of decision-making, from the high-level deliberation of reasoning down to the low-level information processing of perception.", "authors": [{"name": "Sebastian Gottwald", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Daniel A.

{"title": "A Bayesian perspective on classical control", "abstract": "The connections between optimal control and Bayesian inference have long been recognised, with the field of stochastic (optimal) control combining these frameworks for the solution of partially observable control problems. In particular, for the linear case with quadratic functions and Gaussian noise, stochastic control has shown remarkable results in different fields, including robotics, reinforcement learning and neuroscience, especially thanks to the established duality of estimation and control processes. Following this idea we recently introduced a formulation of PID control, one of the most popular methods from classical control, based on active inference, a theory with roots in variational Bayesian methods, and applications in the biological and neural sciences. In this work, we highlight the advantages of our previous formulation and introduce new and more general ways to tackle some existing problems in current controller design procedures. In particular, we consider 1) a gradient-based tuning rule for the parameters (or gains) of a PID controller, 2) an implementation of multiple degrees of freedom for independent responses to different types of signals (e.g., two-degree-of-freedom PID), and 3) a novel time-domain formalisation of the performance-robustness trade-off in terms of tunable constraints (i.e., priors in a Bayesian model) of a single cost functional, variational free energy.", "authors": [{"name": "Manuel Baltieri", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1109/IJCNN48605.2020.9206617", "arxiv_id": "2004.10288", "s2_id": "d1e6c4e0977f0e963bd0cdebc33816766ea1d8f5", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network", "citation_count": 3, "references": ["s2:04f0706eda0b547c3d739d180d1874ce789ecc09", "s2:c378ef9646a7c705d41ee9f77420b5259b797403", "s2:a934a3a7f171d494556a80d31f7bf4b637376c71", "s2:a951a731ef3ab06f3961a6ffabf49249fae32cae", "s2:6c3a9cc00ac7e799866066d84aa9ab4ceceab1fb", "s2:7a79e00724e7e071599a5d46d401188d524106d3", "s2:4aebc0c6dc90f27579b9a781588b13dead81de53", "s2:447adf2c804235bd7361a7e8e91ebb8273752fa1", "s2:850fabb25f3f977b7a33867eb974e0840ffb9e73", "s2:754b657330b1674d3453e8254d3a664db5222b3b", "s2:c65520d5dfa701e68216fa817e180c5f53bd5181", "s2:7fd9310a48c732d987e7bd5e6a9e8687f6ba87a2", "s2:43e810910973b0f46fe7726969193a8ff5616f34", "s2:f7e59546d75b2fe71d1fdda2773f84bb04fcc6d2", "s2:1ed6a4a10589618d4f26350f1a296ee767ceff6b", "s2:2be775f83f445ec8af7fdb4e761afd6cda171b34", "s2:8e5eda285b30216bc5f5ca93d3a93728c15852f8", "s2:1df88f9f0e599b79b1fef6d1bc8dd46271844a0a", "s2:1a014a076cac3c7f5d81a084e296c095f9230437", "s2:c09fb7cfa28cde7ab254f878a5987758b8c5f4d0", "s2:db6fe5751f3736d509a4da9f28dcada265c4e0a6", "s2:9a1227f2fc93d22e13c649e97cfffafc97f3127e", "s2:5c2dd14c18397c27d8d370194bf905c37ed1c42a", "s2:957b308491d07efce5573843d358e3d4a39261e2", "s2:be4405ec46a026a6f602a260765d794a55f0b951", "s2:819e12c46c95add85a4bbfcffa8fe6ba5b1924a4", "s2:c9d93744203db99f3793d5fc78518aad36c1ff3b", "s2:444e943a0ffca465f9cd21b29fe9ef9ffef5560a", "s2:0fc6068b41878056f14028cad5863517ad2128a1", "s2:d1db1fb877f1330e2e9d8890f77b6efa3b351bdb", "s2:72bea1fbe8f7eebffd2f46c46d84ecfd66e755b1", "s2:2fa990eb6747f4e96434e4cc4ddd13a7a13d8246", "s2:705348322eaa7cf29c5d275cbcd3b5377c14315e", "s2:5e3384bd2592c4f8907c3701b76d33c1a278c77b", "s2:bcb15495b263eb3fa4cb34748a67ad571eee382f", "s2:1563447552d60e3f80830d3381603d7632f277f1", "s2:d82829c9fd9cfba8a44efe5ba048d3332a1671fc", "s2:7a61c4971b10c2497076d470ee92df18d96c0535", "s2:a948d4821954132de57542c276ed8b770a7d9a13", "s2:da7a60f2db454fda5a5c412f567edd798f506d80", "s2:ec6b462777a18fee3449617fe3e13a94194050b2", "s2:4a7b9c2b542d656e7c6a7bfe36f6c94237842c72", "s2:5aaf50ca5dd82019664b7f82fb30c334a48f80b9", "s2:f26fd478c98620b32346d6695c102f8ba6f600a0", "s2:ccf78d72e081b401a435b3907eb79beca732b9a6", "s2:a38f35a1e14b3a59b32563f16d5949b63f075baa", "s2:8795823e094bb965ace2bd6d8c17223f72f61a76", "s2:597cf3eb7fbd7c4b231451ec998b8a6ae9996c41", "s2:bff20fb30adad8d1c173963089df5fc9664304f0", "s2:84582f4e37080bc35ff38edea31739e821e76bb0", "s2:0fdd66fcf6b9bc04428e337df66fd510a659eb2f", "s2:adac5f6e4324a9d277242b2e9e86ed671bb7f618", "s2:3283c36cd5c0b4a38237d182516570d7d1f0f550", "s2:4f8d648c52edf74e41b0996128aa536e13cc7e82", "s2:84ac2b27d3f9fc3e1ad845c171efbb9e5fbae739", "s2:68cb640df983627c8ad50a1250042af8ebc8563e", "s2:379a1bfbdfcec49d2992a7e9f72d3dda2e9bbdb5", "s2:f7f15848cd0fbb3d08f351595da833b1627de9c3", "s2:b25a8003a4e62d2db21560c52fb7030547834e87", "s2:255a77422b1da74da05d1714b7875356187385bd", "s2:bb55c1c619c30f939fc792b049172926a4a0c0f7", "s2:7ef50e96eba960fad1878e7754b6266f83a80c6d", "s2:610851562e61cdc7300aaf1008a24966e06aac26", "s2:66e97b3e8c46b8b797cc3d85c151c0bd7ea87339", "s2:4602a97c4965a9f6c41c9a7eeaef5be8333dbaef", "s2:fbe09a5c0dba97cfe38f161cbb34067b23e25aef"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Whence the Expected Free Energy?", "abstract": "The Expected Free Energy (EFE) is a central quantity in the theory of active inference. It is the quantity that all active inference agents are mandated to minimize through action, and its decomposition into extrinsic and intrinsic value terms is key to the balance of exploration and exploitation that active inference agents evince. Despite its importance, the mathematical origins of this quantity and its relation to the Variational Free Energy (VFE) remain unclear. In this paper, we investigate the origins of the EFE in detail and show that it is not simply \"the free energy in the future\". We present a functional that we argue is the natural extension of the VFE, but which actively discourages exploratory behaviour, thus demonstrating that exploration does not directly follow from free energy minimization into the future. We then develop a novel objective, the Free-Energy of the Expected Future (FEEF), which possesses both the epistemic component of the EFE as well as an intuitive mathematical grounding as the divergence between predicted and desired futures.", "authors": [{"name": "Beren Millidge", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Alexander Tschantz", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Christopher L Buckley", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2020, "doi": null, "arxiv_id": "2004.08128", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2020-04-17"}
{"title": "Robot self/other distinction: active inference meets neural networks learning in a mirror", "abstract": "Self/other distinction and self-recognition are important skills for interacting with the world, as it allows humans to differentiate own actions from others and be self-aware. However, only a selected group of animals, mainly high order mammals such as humans, has passed the mirror test, a behavioural experiment proposed to assess self-recognition abilities. In this paper, we describe self-recognition as a process that is built on top of body perception unconscious mechanisms. We present an algorithm that enables a robot to perform non-appearance self-recognition on a mirror and distinguish its simple actions from other entities, by answering the following question: am I generating these sensations? The algorithm combines active inference, a theoretical model of perception and action in the brain, with neural network learning. The robot learns the relation between its actions and its body with the effect produced in the visual field and its body sensors. The prediction error generated between the models and the real observations during the interaction is used to infer the body configuration through free energy minimization and to accumulate evidence for recognizing its body. Experimental results on a humanoid robot show the reliability of the algorithm for different initial conditions, such as mirror recognition in any perspective, robot-robot distinction and human-robot differentiation.", "authors": [{"name": "Pablo Lanillos", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Jordi Pages", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Gordon Cheng", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2020, "doi": null, "arxiv_id": "2004.05473", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2020-04-11"}
{"title": "Deep Active Inference for Autonomous Robot Navigation", "abstract": "Active inference is a theory that underpins the way biological agent's perceive and act in the real world. At its core, active inference is based on the principle that the brain is an approximate Bayesian inference engine, building an internal generative model to drive agents towards minimal surprise. Although this theory has shown interesting results with grounding in cognitive neuroscience, its application remains limited to simulations with small, predefined sensor and state spaces. In this paper, we leverage recent advances in deep learning to build more complex generative models that can work without a predefined states space. State representations are learned end-to-end from real-world, high-dimensional sensory data such as camera frames. We also show that these generative models can be used to engage in active inference.

{"title": "Reinforcement Learning through Active Inference", "abstract": "The central tenet of reinforcement learning (RL) is that agents seek to maximize the sum of cumulative rewards. In contrast, active inference, an emerging framework within cognitive and computational neuroscience, proposes that agents act to maximize the evidence for a biased generative model. Here, we illustrate how ideas from active inference can augment traditional RL approaches by (i) furnishing an inherent balance of exploration and exploitation, and (ii) providing a more flexible conceptualization of reward. Inspired by active inference, we develop and implement a novel objective for decision making, which we term the free energy of the expected future.

{"title": "Investigation of the Sense of Agency in Social Cognition, based on frameworks of Predictive Coding and Active Inference: A simulation study on multimodal imitative interaction", "abstract": "When agents interact socially with different intentions, conflicts are difficult to avoid. Although how agents can resolve such problems autonomously has not been determined, dynamic characteristics of agency may shed light on underlying mechanisms. The current study focused on the sense of agency (SoA), a specific aspect of agency referring to congruence between the agent's intention in acting and the outcome. Employing predictive coding and active inference as theoretical frameworks of perception and action generation, we hypothesize that regulation of complexity in the evidence lower bound of an agent's model should affect the strength of the agent's SoA and should have a critical impact on social interactions. We built a computational model of imitative interaction between a robot and a human via visuo-proprioceptive sensation with a variational Bayes recurrent neural network, and simulated the model in the form of pseudo-imitative interaction using recorded human body movement data. A key feature of the model is that each modality's complexity can be regulated differently with a hyperparameter assigned to each module. We first searched for an optimal setting that endows the model with appropriate coordination of multimodal sensation. This revealed that the vision module's complexity should be more tightly regulated than that of the proprioception module. Using the optimally trained model, we examined how changing the tightness of complexity regulation after training affects the strength of the SoA during interactions. The results showed that with looser regulation, an agent tends to act more egocentrically, without adapting to the other. In contrast, with tighter regulation, the agent tends to follow the other by adjusting its intention. We conclude that the tightness of complexity regulation crucially affects the strength of the SoA and the dynamics of interactions between agents.", "authors": [{"name": "Wataru Ohata", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Jun Tani", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.3389/fnbot.2020.00061", "arxiv_id": "2002.01632", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2020-02-05"}

{"title": "Neural Dynamics under Active Inference: Plausibility and Efficiency of Information Processing", "abstract": "Active inference is a normative framework for explaining behaviour under the free energy principle—a theory of self-organisation originating in neuroscience. It specifies neuronal dynamics for state-estimation in terms of a descent on (variational) free energy—a measure of the fit between an internal (generative) model and sensory observations. The free energy gradient is a prediction error—plausibly encoded in the average membrane potentials of neuronal populations. Conversely, the expected probability of a state can be expressed in terms of neuronal firing rates. We show that this is consistent with current models of neuronal dynamics and establish face validity by synthesising plausible electrophysiological responses. We then show that these neuronal dynamics approximate natural gradient descent, a well-known optimisation algorithm from information geometry that follows the steepest descent of the objective in information space. We compare the information length of belief updating in both schemes, a measure of the distance travelled in information space that has a direct interpretation in terms of metabolic cost. We show that neural dynamics under active inference are metabolically efficient and suggest that neural representations in biological agents may evolve by approximating steepest descent in information space towards the point of optimal inference.", "authors": [{"name": "Lancelot Da Costa", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Thomas Parr", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "B.

{"title": "Active inference on discrete state-spaces: a synthesis", "abstract": "Active inference is a normative principle underwriting perception, action, planning, decision-making and learning in biological or artificial agents. From its inception, its associated process theory has grown to incorporate complex generative models, enabling simulation of a wide range of complex behaviours. Due to successive developments in active inference, it is often difficult to see how its underlying principle relates to process theories and practical implementation. In this paper, we try to bridge this gap by providing a complete mathematical synthesis of active inference on discrete state-space models. This technical summary provides an overview of the theory, derives neuronal dynamics from first principles and relates this dynamics to biological processes. Furthermore, this paper provides a fundamental building block needed to understand active inference for mixed generative models; allowing continuous sensations to inform discrete representations. This paper may be used as follows: to guide research towards outstanding challenges, a practical guide on how to implement active inference to simulate experimental behaviour, or a pointer towards various in-silico neurophysiological responses that may be used to make empirical predictions.", "authors": [{"name": "Lancelot Da Costa", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Thomas Parr", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Noor Sajid", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Sebastijan Veselic", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Victorita Neacsu", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Karl Friston", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1016/j.jmp.2020.102447", "arxiv_id": "2001.07203", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2020-01-20"}

Our algorithm combines the free energy principle from neuroscience, rooted in variational inference, with deep convolutional decoders to scale the algorithm to directly deal with raw visual input and provide online adaptive inference. Our approach is validated by studying body perception and action in a simulated and a real Nao robot. Results show that our approach allows the robot to perform 1) dynamical body estimation of its arm using only monocular camera images and 2) autonomous reaching to “imagined” arm poses in visual space. This suggests that robot and human body perception and action can be efficiently solved by viewing both as an active inference problem guided by ongoing sensory input.", "authors": [{"name": "Cansu Sancaktar", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Pablo Lanillos", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2019, "doi": "10.1109/ICDL-EpiRob48136.2020.9278105", "arxiv_id": "2001.05847", "s2_id": "0f1440184094a1fc3483fbc2d36eae2e1c88851d", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "Joint IEEE International Conference on Development and Learning and on Epigenetic Robotics", "citation_count": 62, "references": ["s2:e5d0bae3642eccdd0ba90c43c4c0ed4a174c2b64", "s2:a951a731ef3ab06f3961a6ffabf49249fae32cae", "s2:02ab91e61deda5e3c5034f828702db2a46d6df99", "s2:40b5e503ca03da59f36bd632b9f5c125f3a14ff2", "s2:def8207fb6457f3c2656bac9f2bbf954de1d7de1", "s2:1dc4001974f99122610964b3731882cca9c228a0", "s2:2d755d605792d01eae81fd51e37424f9226776b9", "s2:3aadab924520c58be81781aafd51e6807e9c4576", "s2:8573a8996903bbaa670ff7634f068d2b083a1542", "s2:5870d0edaaa0f28bbe657238febaaf1181e81378", "s2:af6f5f8ed8c901f8d1298155c6275242b4a4e7c0", "s2:754b657330b1674d3453e8254d3a664db5222b3b", "s2:0928a500ce143ee135ad04709c58feaf8bd536fd", "s2:d9dab7574d56ae81efe6c90c213c6509b36cf950", "s2:474b5dd4c0a92939a3dede3cb989bed930971b3d", "s2:1fecf3574536c1606051ec796ca7c9f4fce77834", "s2:f19284f6ab802c8a1fcde076fcb3fba195a71723", "s2:f1e9f30d360f4493e17e72637c34ea2d6508f7b1", "s2:b6b8a1b80891c96c28cc6340267b58186157e536", "s2:1c3d7d5a9a9eafa084913b8c83a013c81d50479f", "s2:5f5dc5b9a2ba710937e2c413b37b053cd673df02", "s2:ebba6d8eb60a0b591167f4f8ede4398df42de50a", "s2:02420e6f7abe8a13eb951a1bdce7658098b3f888", "s2:1ed6a4a10589618d4f26350f1a296ee767ceff6b", "s2:7a7a23f2c39f9b1526bc8853c6c71a5b7f89e68c", "s2:d98d0d1900b13b87aa4ffd6b69c046beb63f0434", "s2:4d7149f94a42158c92e29cdf6a512d6082841841", "s2:15bd9a5bb8c0419221e8bfd178de3c33876a0de5", "s2:4676d81d6a2477f6ea1de5723fc81e431fbaa96f", "s2:605402e235bd62437baf3c9ebefe77fb4d92ee95", "s2:3dc3a0efe58eaf8564ca1965c0ffd23ec495b83f", "s2:329705a255360c8f86a10d909a92794ed8a0857a", "s2:a424ec3b8846f57b8ffdb566d272e28d5a525909"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Text as Environment: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Text Readability Assessment Model", "abstract": "Evaluating the readability of a text can significantly facilitate the precise expression of information in written form. The formulation of text readability assessment involves the identification of meaningful properties of the text regardless of its length. Sophisticated features and models are used to evaluate the comprehensibility of texts accurately. Despite this, the problem of assessing texts' readability efficiently remains relatively untouched. The efficiency of state-of-the-art text readability assessment models can be further improved using deep reinforcement learning models. Using a hard attention-based active inference technique, the proposed approach makes efficient use of input text and computational resources. Through the use of semi-supervised signals, the reinforcement learning model uses the minimum amount of text in order to determine text's readability. A comparison of the model on Weebit and Cambridge Exams with state-of-the-art models, such as the BERT text readability model, shows that it is capable of achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with a significantly smaller amount of input text than other models.", "authors": [{"name": "Hamid Mohammadi", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Seyed Hossein Khasteh", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Tahereh Firoozi", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Taha Samavati", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2019, "doi": null, "arxiv_id": "1912.05957", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2019-12-12"}
{"title": "Scaling active inference", "abstract": "In reinforcement learning (RL), agents often operate in partially observed and uncertain environments. Model-based RL suggests that this is best achieved by learning and exploiting a probabilistic model of the world. 'Active inference' is an emerging normative framework in cognitive and computational neuroscience that offers a unifying account of how biological agents achieve this. On this framework, inference, learning and action emerge from a single imperative to maximize the Bayesian evidence for a niched model of the world. However, implementations of this process have thus far been restricted to low-dimensional and idealized situations. Here, we present a working implementation of active inference that applies to high-dimensional tasks, with proof-of-principle results demonstrating efficient exploration and an order of magnitude increase in sample efficiency over strong model-free baselines. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of applying active inference at scale and highlight the operational homologies between active inference and current model-based approaches to RL.", "authors": [{"name": "Alexander Tschantz", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Manuel Baltieri", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Anil.

From the perspective of neurorobotics, we investigate the relation between intentionality, motor compliance, cognitive compliance, and behavior emergence. We propose a variational model inspired by the principles of predictive coding and active inference to study intentionality and cognitive compliance, and an intermittent control concept for motor deliberation and compliance based on torque feed-back.

{"title": "Bayesian Analogical Cybernetics", "abstract": "It has been argued that all of cognition can be understood in terms of Bayesian inference. It has also been argued that analogy is the core of cognition. Here I will propose that these perspectives are fully compatible, in that analogical reasoning can be described in terms of Bayesian inference and vice versa, and that both of these positions require a thorough cybernetic grounding in order to fulfill their promise as unifying frameworks for understanding minds. From the Bayesian perspective of the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference framework, thought is constituted by dynamics of cascading belief propagation through the nodes of probabilistic generative models specified by a cortical heterarchy \"rooted\" in action-perception cycles that ground the mind as an embodied control system for an autonomous agent. From the analogical structure mapping perspective, thought is constituted by the alignment and comparison of heterogeneous structural representations. Here I will propose that this core cognitive process for analogical reasoning is naturally implemented by predictive coding mechanisms. However, both Bayesian cognitive science and models of cognitive development via analogical reasoning require rich base domains and priors (or reliably learnable posteriors) from which they can commence the process of bootstrapping minds.

{"title": "Application of the Free Energy Principle to Estimation and Control", "abstract": "Based on a generative model (GM) and beliefs over hidden states, the free energy principle (FEP) enables an agent to sense and act by minimizing a free energy bound on Bayesian surprise, i.e., the negative logarithm of the marginal likelihood. Inclusion of desired states in the form of prior beliefs in the GM leads to active inference (ActInf). In this work, we aim to reveal connections between ActInf and stochastic optimal control. We reveal that, in contrast to standard cost and constraint-based solutions, ActInf gives rise to a minimization problem that includes both an information-theoretic surprise term and a model-predictive control cost term. We further show under which conditions both methodologies yield the same solution for estimation and control. For a case with linear Gaussian dynamics and a quadratic cost, we illustrate the performance of ActInf under varying system parameters and compare to classical solutions for estimation and control.", "authors": [{"name": "Thijs van de Laar", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Ayça Özçelikkale", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "H.

{"title": "A Novel Adaptive Controller for Robot Manipulators based on Active Inference", "abstract": "More adaptive controllers for robot manipulators are needed, which can deal with large model uncertainties. This paper presents a novel active inference controller (AIC) as an adaptive control scheme for industrial robots. This scheme is easily scalable to high degrees-of-freedom, and it maintains high performance even in the presence of large unmodeled dynamics. The proposed method is based on active inference, a promising neuroscientific theory of the brain, which describes a biologically plausible algorithm for perception and action. In this work, we formulate active inference from a control perspective, deriving a model-free control law which is less sensitive to unmodeled dynamics. The performance and the adaptive properties of the algorithm are compared to a state-of-the-art model reference adaptive controller (MRAC) in an experimental setup with a real 7-DOF robot arm. The results showed that the AIC outperformed the MRAC in terms of adaptability, providing a more general control law. This confirmed the relevance of active inference for robot control.", "authors": [{"name": "Corrado Pezzato", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Riccardo Ferrari", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Carlos Hernandez", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2019, "doi": "10.1109/LRA.2020.2974451", "arxiv_id": "1909.12768", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2019-09-27"}
{"title": "Active Inference: Demystified and Compared", "abstract": "Active inference is a first principle account of how autonomous agents operate in dynamic, nonstationary environments. This problem is also considered in reinforcement learning, but limited work exists on comparing the two approaches on the same discrete-state environments. In this letter, we provide (1) an accessible overview of the discrete-state formulation of active inference, highlighting natural behaviors in active inference that are generally engineered in reinforcement learning, and (2) an explicit discrete-state comparison between active inference and reinforcement learning on an OpenAI gym baseline. We begin by providing a condensed overview of the active inference literature, in particular viewing the various natural behaviors of active inference agents through the lens of reinforcement learning. We show that by operating in a pure belief-based setting, active inference agents can carry out epistemic exploration—and account for uncertainty about their environment—in a Bayes-optimal fashion. Furthermore, we show that the reliance on an explicit reward signal in reinforcement learning is removed in active inference, where reward can simply be treated as another observation we have a preference over; even in the total absence of rewards, agent behaviors are learned through preference learning. We make these properties explicit by showing two scenarios in which active inference agents can infer behaviors in reward-free environments compared to both Q-learning and Bayesian model-based reinforcement learning agents and by placing zero prior preferences over rewards and learning the prior preferences over the observations corresponding to reward. We conclude by noting that this formalism can be applied to more complex settings (e.g., robotic arm movement, Atari games) if appropriate generative models can be formulated. In short, we aim to demystify the behavior of active inference agents by presenting an accessible discrete state-space and time formulation and demonstrate these behaviors in a OpenAI gym environment, alongside reinforcement learning agents.", "authors": [{"name": "Noor Sajid", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Philip J.

{"title": "Deep Active Inference as Variational Policy Gradients", "abstract": "Active Inference is a theory of action arising from neuroscience which casts action and planning as a bayesian inference problem to be solved by minimizing a single quantity - the variational free energy. Active Inference promises a unifying account of action and perception coupled with a biologically plausible process theory. Despite these potential advantages, current implementations of Active Inference can only handle small, discrete policy and state-spaces and typically require the environmental dynamics to be known. In this paper we propose a novel deep Active Inference algorithm which approximates key densities using deep neural networks as flexible function approximators, which enables Active Inference to scale to significantly larger and more complex tasks. We demonstrate our approach on a suite of OpenAIGym benchmark tasks and obtain performance comparable with common reinforcement learning baselines. Moreover, our algorithm shows similarities with maximum entropy reinforcement learning and the policy gradients algorithm, which reveals interesting connections between the Active Inference framework and reinforcement learning.", "authors": [{"name": "Beren Millidge", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2019, "doi": null, "arxiv_id": "1907.03876", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2019-07-08"}
{"title": "A World unto Itself: Human Communication as Active Inference", "abstract": "Work in developmental psychology suggests that humans are predisposed to align their mental states with other individuals. This manifests principally in cooperative communication, that is, intentional communication geared towards aligning mental states. This viewpoint has received ample empirical support. However, this view lacks a formal grounding, and provides no precise neuroscientific hypotheses. To remedy this, we suggest an active inference approach to cooperative communication. We suggest that humans appear to possess an evolved adaptive prior belief that their mental states are aligned with those of conspecifics.

{"title": "An Empirical Study of Active Inference on a Humanoid Robot", "abstract": "One of the biggest challenges in robotics is interacting under uncertainty. Unlike robots, humans learn, adapt, and perceive their body as a unity when interacting with the world. Here, we investigate the suitability of active inference, a computational model proposed for the brain and governed by the free-energy principle, for robotic body perception and action in a nonsimulated environment. We designed and deployed the algorithm on the humanoid iCub showing how our proposed model enabled the robot to have adaptive body perception and to perform robust upper body reaching and head object tracking behaviors even under high levels of sensor noise and discrepancies between the model and the real robot. Estimation and control are formalized as an inference problem where the body posterior state distribution is approximated by means of the variational free-energy bound, yielding to a minimization of the prediction error. Besides, our study forecasts reactive actions in the presence of sensorimotor conflicts, a mechanism that may be relevant in human body adaptation to uncertain situations.", "authors": [{"name": "G.

{"title": "Nonmodular architectures of cognitive systems based on active inference", "abstract": "In psychology and neuroscience it is common to describe cognitive systems as input/output devices where perceptual and motor functions are implemented in a purely feedforward, open-loop fashion. On this view, perception and action are often seen as encapsulated modules with limited interaction between them. While embodied and enactive approaches to cognitive science have challenged the idealisation of the brain as an input/output device, we argue that even the more recent attempts to model systems using closed-loop architectures still heavily rely on a strong separation between motor and perceptual functions. Previously, we have suggested that the mainstream notion of modularity strongly resonates with the separation principle of control theory. In this work we present a minimal model of a sensorimotor loop implementing an architecture based on the separation principle. We link this to popular formulations of perception and action in the cognitive sciences, and show its limitations when, for instance, external forces are not modelled by an agent. These forces can be seen as variables that an agent cannot directly control, i.e., a perturbation from the environment or an interference caused by other agents. As an alternative approach inspired by embodied cognitive science, we then propose a nonmodular architecture based on the active inference framework. We demonstrate the robustness of this architecture to unknown external inputs and show that the mechanism with which this is achieved in linear models is equivalent to integral control.", "authors": [{"name": "Manuel Baltieri", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Christopher L.

We design white-box inference attacks to perform a comprehensive privacy analysis of deep learning models. We measure the privacy leakage through parameters of fully trained models as well as the parameter updates of models during training. We design inference algorithms for both centralized and federated learning, with respect to passive and active inference attackers, and assuming different adversary prior knowledge. We evaluate our novel white-box membership inference attacks against deep learning algorithms to trace their training data records. We show that a straightforward extension of the known black-box attacks to the white-box setting (through analyzing the outputs of activation functions) is ineffective. We therefore design new algorithms tailored to the white-box setting by exploiting the privacy vulnerabilities of the stochastic gradient descent algorithm, which is the algorithm used to train deep neural networks. We investigate the reasons why deep learning models may leak information about their training data. We then show that even well-generalized models are significantly susceptible to white-box membership inference attacks, by analyzing state-of-the-art pre-trained and publicly available models for the CIFAR dataset.

Under a constraint on the number of processes that can be probed simultaneously, the decision maker should decide which processes to probe at each time and when to terminate the probing. Compared with previous work considering only the observation costs, the switching costs of switchings across processes also need to be taken into account in many practical scenarios. The objective is an active inference strategy that minimizes the Bayesian risk taking into account of the sample complexity, switching cost, as well as detection errors. Based on the framework of sequential design of experiments, we propose a low-complexity, low-switching deterministic policy for two scenarios where the total switching cost is negligible and the total switching cost is comparable to the total observation cost.

{"title": "Hybrid Active Inference", "abstract": "We describe a framework of hybrid cognition by formulating a hybrid cognitive agent that performs hierarchical active inference across a human and a machine part. We suggest that, in addition to enhancing human cognitive functions with an intelligent and adaptive interface, integrated cognitive processing could accelerate emergent properties within artificial intelligence. To establish this, a machine learning part learns to integrate into human cognition by explaining away multi-modal sensory measurements from the environment and physiology simultaneously with the brain signal. With ongoing training, the amount of predictable brain signal increases. This lends the agent the ability to self-supervise on increasingly high levels of cognitive processing in order to further minimize surprise in predicting the brain signal. Furthermore, with increasing level of integration, the access to sensory information about environment and physiology is substituted with access to their representation in the brain. While integrating into a joint embodiment of human and machine, human action and perception are treated as the machine's own. The framework can be implemented with invasive as well as non-invasive sensors for environment, body and brain interfacing. Online and offline training with different machine learning approaches are thinkable. Building on previous research on shared representation learning, we suggest a first implementation leading towards hybrid active inference with non-invasive brain interfacing and state of the art probabilistic deep learning methods. We further discuss how implementation might have effect on the meta-cognitive abilities of the described agent and suggest that with adequate implementation the machine part can continue to execute and build upon the learned cognitive processes autonomously.", "authors": [{"name": "André Ofner", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Sebastian Stober", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2018, "doi": null, "arxiv_id": "1810.02647", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2018-10-05"}
{"title": "Active image restoration", "abstract": "We study active restoration of noise-corrupted images generated via the Gibbs probability of an Ising ferromagnet in external magnetic field. Ferromagnetism accounts for the prior expectation of data smoothness, i.e. a positive correlation between neighbouring pixels (Ising spins), while the magnetic field refers to the bias. The restoration is actively supervised by requesting the true values of certain pixels after a noisy observation. This additional information improves restoration of other pixels. The optimal strategy of active inference is not known for realistic (two-dimensional) images. We determine this strategy for the mean-field version of the model and show that it amounts to supervising the values of spins (pixels) that do not agree with the sign of the average magnetization. The strategy leads to a transparent analytical expression for the minimal Bayesian risk, and shows that there is a maximal number of pixels beyond of which the supervision is useless. We show numerically that this strategy applies for two-dimensional images away from the critical regime. Within this regime the strategy is outperformed by its local (adaptive) version, which supervises pixels that do not agree with their Bayesian estimate.

REPRISE infers the unobservable contextual event state and accompanying temporal predictive models that best explain the recently encountered sensorimotor experiences retrospectively. Meanwhile, it optimizes upcoming motor activities prospectively in a goal-directed manner. Here, REPRISE is implemented by a recurrent neural network (RNN), which learns temporal forward models of the sensorimotor contingencies generated by different simulated dynamic vehicles. The RNN is augmented with contextual neurons, which enable the encoding of distinct, but related, sensorimotor dynamics as compact event codes. We show that REPRISE concurrently learns to separate and approximate the encountered sensorimotor dynamics: it analyzes sensorimotor error signals adapting both internal contextual neural activities and connection weight values. Moreover, we show that REPRISE can exploit the learned model to induce goal-directed, model-predictive control, that is, approximate active inference: Given a goal state, the system imagines a motor command sequence optimizing it with the prospective objective to minimize the distance to the goal. The RNN activities thus continuously imagine the upcoming future and reflect on the recent past, optimizing the predictive model, the hidden neural state activities, and the upcoming motor activities.

{"title": "Expanding the Active Inference Landscape: More Intrinsic Motivations in the Perception-Action Loop", "abstract": "Active inference is an ambitious theory that treats perception, inference and action selection of autonomous agents under the heading of a single principle. It suggests biologically plausible explanations for many cognitive phenomena, including consciousness. In active inference, action selection is driven by an objective function that evaluates possible future actions with respect to current, inferred beliefs about the world. Active inference at its core is independent from extrinsic rewards, resulting in a high level of robustness across e.g.\\ different environments or agent morphologies. In the literature, paradigms that share this independence have been summarised under the notion of intrinsic motivations. In general and in contrast to active inference, these models of motivation come without a commitment to particular inference and action selection mechanisms. In this article, we study if the inference and action selection machinery of active inference can also be used by alternatives to the originally included intrinsic motivation. The perception-action loop explicitly relates inference and action selection to the environment and agent memory, and is consequently used as foundation for our analysis. We reconstruct the active inference approach, locate the original formulation within, and show how alternative intrinsic motivations can be used while keeping many of the original features intact. Furthermore, we illustrate the connection to universal reinforcement learning by means of our formalism. Active inference research may profit from comparisons of the dynamics induced by alternative intrinsic motivations. Research on intrinsic motivations may profit from an additional way to implement intrinsically motivated agents that also share the biological plausibility of active inference.", "authors": [{"name": "Martin Biehl", "affiliation": "Araya Inc., Tokyo, Japan", "orcid": null}, {"name": "Christian Guckelsberger", "affiliation": "Computational Creativity Group, Department of Computing, Goldsmiths, University of London, London, UK", "orcid": null}, {"name": "Christoph Salge", "affiliation": "Game Innovation Lab, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, New York University, New York City, NY, USA", "orcid": null}, {"name": "Simón C.

Therefore, this predictive stream in the sensorimotor loop is generated in a top-down manner. Specifically, it is constantly modulated by the motor actions and is updated by the bottom-up prediction error signals. In this way, the top-down prediction originally comes from the prior experience from both perception and action representing the higher levels of this hierarchical cognition.

{"title": "Deep active inference", "abstract": "This work combines the free energy principle and the ensuing active inference dynamics with recent advances in variational inference in deep generative models, and evolution strategies to introduce the “deep active inference” agent. This agent minimises a variational free energy bound on the average surprise of its sensations, which is motivated by a homeostatic argument. It does so by optimising the parameters of a generative latent variable model of its sensory inputs, together with a variational density approximating the posterior distribution over the latent variables, given its observations, and by acting on its environment to actively sample input that is likely under this generative model. The internal dynamics of the agent are implemented using deep and recurrent neural networks, as used in machine learning, making the deep active inference agent a scalable and very flexible class of active inference agent. Using the mountain car problem, we show how goal-directed behaviour can be implemented by defining appropriate priors on the latent states in the agent’s model. Furthermore, we show that the deep active inference agent can learn a generative model of the environment, which can be sampled from to understand the agent’s beliefs about the environment and its interaction therewith.", "authors": [{"name": "K.

{"title": "An active inference implementation of phototaxis", "abstract": "Active inference is emerging as a possible unifying theory of perception and action in cognitive and computational neuroscience. On this theory, perception is a process of inferring the causes of sensory data by minimising the error between actual sensations and those predicted by an inner \\emph{generative} (probabilistic) model. Action on the other hand is drawn as a process that modifies the world such that the consequent sensory input meets expectations encoded in the same internal model. These two processes, inferring properties of the world and inferring actions needed to meet expectations, close the sensory/motor loop and suggest a deep symmetry between action and perception. In this work we present a simple agent-based model inspired by this new theory that offers insights on some of its central ideas. Previous implementations of active inference have typically examined a \"perception-oriented\" view of this theory, assuming that agents are endowed with a detailed generative model of their surrounding environment. In contrast, we present an \"action-oriented\" solution showing how adaptive behaviour can emerge even when agents operate with a simple model which bears little resemblance to their environment. We examine how various parameters of this formulation allow phototaxis and present an example of a different, \"pathological\" behaviour.", "authors": [{"name": "Manuel Baltieri", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Christopher L.

At each time, a subset of processes can be probed. The objective is to design a sequential probing strategy that dynamically determines which processes to observe at each time and when to terminate the search so that the expected detection time is minimized under a constraint on the probability of misclassifying any process. This problem falls into the general setting of sequential design of experiments pioneered by Chernoff in 1959, in which a randomized strategy, referred to as the Chernoff test, was proposed and shown to be asymptotically optimal as the error probability approaches zero. For the problem considered in this paper, a low-complexity deterministic test is shown to enjoy the same asymptotic optimality while offering significantly better performance in the finite regime and faster convergence to the optimal rate function, especially when the number of processes is large.

{"title": "Active inference, eye movements and oculomotor delays", "abstract": "This paper considers the problem of sensorimotor delays in the optimal control of (smooth) eye movements under uncertainty. Specifically, we consider delays in the visuo-oculomotor loop and their implications for active inference. Active inference uses a generalisation of Kalman filtering to provide Bayes optimal estimates of hidden states and action in generalized coordinates of motion. Representing hidden states in generalized coordinates provides a simple way of compensating for both sensory and oculomotor delays. The efficacy of this scheme is illustrated using neuronal simulations of pursuit initiation responses, with and without compensation. We then consider an extension of the gener-ative model to simulate smooth pursuit eye movements - in which the visuo-oculomotor system believes both the target and its centre of gaze are attracted to a (hidden) point moving in the visual field. Finally, the generative model is equipped with a hierarchical structure, so that it can recognise and remember unseen (occluded) trajectories and emit anticipatory responses. These simulations speak to a straightforward and neurobiologically plausible solution to the generic problem of integrating information from different sources with different temporal delays and the particular difficulties encountered when a system - like the oculomotor system - tries to control its environment with delayed signals.", "authors": [{"name": "Laurent Perrinet", "affiliation": "INT", "orcid": null}, {"name": "Rick Adams", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Karl Friston", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2016, "doi": "10.1007/s00422-014-0620-8", "arxiv_id": "1610.05564", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2016-10-18"}

Here, we present a field-theoretic framework in which sensory adaptation emerges from a variational free-energy principle, formulated as a stochastic differential game between an organism and its environment. Using an Onsager--Machlup path-integral formalism, we show that the resulting adaptive dynamics are mathematically equivalent to a class of model reference adaptive control schemes and can be interpreted as a dynamic renormalization of the system's Green's function. Within this framework, the phasic overshoot commonly observed in sensory responses arises naturally from an effective inertia ($m^* \\approx τγ$) generated by memory-dissipation coupling, rather than from biochemical fine-tuning.

{"title": "Don't Break the Boundary: Continual Unlearning for OOD Detection Based on Free Energy Repulsion", "abstract": "Deploying trustworthy AI in open-world environments faces a dual challenge: the necessity for robust Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection to ensure system safety, and the demand for flexible machine unlearning to satisfy privacy compliance and model rectification. However, this objective encounters a fundamental geometric contradiction: current OOD detectors rely on a static and compact data manifold, whereas traditional classification-oriented unlearning methods disrupt this delicate structure, leading to a catastrophic loss of the model's capability to discriminate anomalies while erasing target classes. To resolve this dilemma, we first define the problem of boundary-preserving class unlearning and propose a pivotal conceptual shift: in the context of OOD detection, effective unlearning is mathematically equivalent to transforming the target class into OOD samples. Based on this, we propose the TFER (Total Free Energy Repulsion) framework. Inspired by the free energy principle, TFER constructs a novel Push-Pull game mechanism: it anchors retained classes within a low-energy ID manifold through a pull mechanism, while actively expelling forgotten classes to high-energy OOD regions using a free energy repulsion force. This approach is implemented via parameter-efficient fine-tuning, circumventing the prohibitive cost of full retraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TFER achieves precise unlearning while maximally preserving the model's discriminative performance on remaining classes and external OOD data. More importantly, our study reveals that the unique Push-Pull equilibrium of TFER endows the model with inherent structural stability, allowing it to effectively resist catastrophic forgetting without complex additional constraints, thereby demonstrating exceptional potential in continual unlearning tasks.", "authors": [{"name": "Ningkang Peng", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Kun Shao", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Jingyang Mao", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Linjin Qian", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Xiaoqian Peng", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Xichen Yang", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Yanhui Gu", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2026, "doi": null, "arxiv_id": "2602.06331", "s2_id": "dd53a5f80fae37fa0d58fa081d9745986b66ae84", "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": ["s2:fc6fb33dcb275aed9f6f9b995b6fa4b2d6cbb1d0", "s2:62a63607647b48e1da0f8bac0c24d06ce15f2ef8", "s2:ac4787b4dbba7a1e7c9e8237993ec89e466e9039", "s2:0cba64a3454f9a3093b6a6fa7dc9a306b971c212", "s2:d2726daa50c4dba55913d11f63f122700f0a033a", "s2:200330d1bf6047d658aa9c2328e282f1654787dd", "s2:59027b574cd02905cbdcb1fd8feefb878cc49c8d", "s2:5ebe70ad23f2300f24d2dce4fb0eb5306faba348", "s2:431860f783a8e5d4da8038748b1708232b67e856", "s2:7b2180d7fa0d65e8756401cb077bf3dea3f9b575", "s2:0fe615dc0a422100e85cfb7e26c9306c481f6c75", "s2:169983a72aced7faac5536de2a0b12b7975e2dd0", "s2:35b966347dae2f0d496ea713edf03a68211838a5", "s2:e1bb329621de73d08c47beae9b5439a1c244eb1a", "s2:617dad3ccbbf9e93c4faf54e19e449649433a10d", "s2:c2eff53cc9db9eaca8d9ffe06f2d618b0e360c9d", "s2:4ebdc89a4dac0d05d8a2567e3b7849be198cb0ba", "s2:8e58dc63817a2a26e5a2ddad38d8b1d19d1c3795", "s2:97cd86d8d8c0f27cd3e64c6ca5cfdeb957ee39f4", "s2:c956d133b78e0d9b20885593809f0b636ce34093", "s2:b9bd435b65d8214f1bcab9268ac2fce509cfffe6", "s2:925182b91f51f8f2b747f7829e9d25ffc2729e5d", "s2:6507909a8f77c88144c3a67b9336bd1c85e84cac", "s2:d03ca175e2b2745126e792fdc31dfadae4c63afa", "s2:547c854985629cfa9404a5ba8ca29367b5f8c25f", "s2:6ff2a434578ff2746b9283e45abf296887f48a2d", "s2:e90ec61e867579bc8bff26e686a59f70129e612c"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "How Intrinsic Motivation Underlies Embodied Open-Ended Behavior", "abstract": "Although most theories posit that natural behavior can be explained as maximizing some form of extrinsic reward, often called utility, some behaviors appear to be reward independent. For instance, spontaneous motor babbling in human newborns and curiosity in little kids and other animals seem to elude a simple explanation in terms of extrinsic reward maximization. Rooted in these observations, intrinsic motivation has emerged as a potentially major driver of behavior. However, only recently have several quantitative and foundational theories of intrinsic motivation been put forward. We first provide a general framework to understand behavior as being organized hierarchically: objective--intrinsic reward, or motivation--drives, goals and extrinsic reward. We next review the main formalizations of intrinsic motivation, including empowerment, the free energy principle, information-gain maximization, and the maximum occupancy principle. These theories produce complex behavior by promoting, in various ways, entropic action-state paths. The presence of a single intrinsic motivation objective breaks infinite regress, as drives and goals act only temporarily to serve the objective. Extrinsic rewards, such as sugar or protein, are just a means to achieve the objective. Bounded cognition and embodiment impose constraints and boundary conditions for the intrinsic motivation objective. By virtue of their capability to generate complex behavior in a task-agnostic manner, theories of intrinsic motivation promise to become successful generative models of open-ended, embodied behavior.", "authors": [{"name": "Rubén Moreno-Bote", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Ralf Haefner", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Jordi Galiano-Landeira", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Tianming Yang", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Pedro Maldonado", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2026, "doi": null, "arxiv_id": "2601.10276", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2026-01-15"}

A prime example is the attractive three-color Hubbard model, in which trion states emerge at strong coupling. Nevertheless, much of its trion ordering on two-dimensional lattices remains uncertain. Here, we employ the determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) method to simulate the attractive three-color Hubbard model on a $π$-flux square lattice at half filling. We show that color-dependent attractive interaction can induce coexisting charge density wave (CDW) and Néel ordered states in the three-color $π$-flux Hubbard model. In particular, enhanced charge fluctuations (cf. honeycomb lattice) cause much stronger Néel ordering on the $π$-flux square lattice. The coexisting charge and Néel orders survive up to a melting temperature, at which they vanish simultaneously.

A prevailing theory in cognitive neuroscience proposes that the human brain operates through hierarchical predictive processing, which underlies flexible cognition and behavior by integrating multimodal sensory signals. Inspired by this principle, we introduce a hierarchical multimodal recurrent neural network grounded in predictive processing under the free-energy principle, capable of directly integrating over 30,000-dimensional visuo-proprioceptive inputs without dimensionality reduction. The model was able to learn two representative caregiving tasks, rigid-body repositioning and flexible-towel wiping, without task-specific feature engineering. We demonstrate three key properties: (i) self-organization of hierarchical latent dynamics that regulate task transitions, capture variability in uncertainty, and infer occluded states; (ii) robustness to degraded vision through visuo-proprioceptive integration; and (iii) asymmetric interference in multitask learning, where the more variable wiping task had little influence on repositioning, whereas learning the repositioning task led to a modest reduction in wiping performance, while the model maintained overall robustness.

{"title": "Bridging integrated information theory and the free-energy principle in living neuronal networks", "abstract": "The relationship between Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and the Free-Energy Principle (FEP) remains unresolved, particularly with respect to how integrated information, proposed as the intrinsic substrate of consciousness, behaves within variational Bayesian inference. We investigated this issue using dissociated neuronal cultures, previously shown to perform perceptual inference consistent with the FEP. Repeated stimulation from hidden sources induced robust source selectivity: variational free energy (VFE) decreased across sessions, whereas accuracy and Bayesian surprise (complexity) increased. Network-level analyses revealed that a proxy measure of integrated information and the size of the main complex followed a hill-shaped trajectory, with informational cores organizing diverse neuronal activity. Across experiments, integrated information correlated strongly and positively with Bayesian surprise, modestly and heterogeneously with accuracy, and showed no significant relationship with VFE. The positive coupling between {\\Phi} and Bayesian surprise likely reflects the diversity of activity observed in critical dynamics. These findings suggest that integrated information increases specifically during belief updating, when sensory inputs are most informative, rather than tracking model efficiency. The hill-shaped trajectory of {\\Phi} during inference can be functionally interpreted as a transition from exploration to exploitation.

{"title": "Bio-Inspired Artificial Neural Networks based on Predictive Coding", "abstract": "Backpropagation (BP) of errors is the backbone training algorithm for artificial neural networks (ANNs). It updates network weights through gradient descent to minimize a loss function representing the mismatch between predictions and desired outputs. BP uses the chain rule to propagate the loss gradient backward through the network hierarchy, allowing efficient weight updates. However, this process requires weight updates at every layer to rely on a global error signal generated at the network's output. In contrast, the Hebbian model of synaptic plasticity states that weight updates are local, depending only on the activity of pre- and post-synaptic neurons. This suggests biological brains likely do not implement BP directly. Recently, Predictive Coding (PC) has gained interest as a biologically plausible alternative that updates weights using only local information. Originating from 1950s work on signal compression, PC was later proposed as a model of the visual cortex and formalized under the free energy principle, linking it to Bayesian inference and dynamical systems. PC weight updates rely solely on local information and provide theoretical advantages such as automatic scaling of gradients based on uncertainty. This lecture notes column offers a novel, tutorial-style introduction to PC, focusing on its formulation, derivation, and connections to well-known optimization and signal processing algorithms such as BP and the Kalman Filter (KF).

{"title": "Free Energy-Inspired Cognitive Risk Integration for AV Navigation in Pedestrian-Rich Environments", "abstract": "Recent advances in autonomous vehicle (AV) behavior planning have shown impressive social interaction capabilities when interacting with other road users. However, achieving human-like prediction and decision-making in interactions with vulnerable road users remains a key challenge in complex multi-agent interactive environments. Existing research focuses primarily on crowd navigation for small mobile robots, which cannot be directly applied to AVs due to inherent differences in their decision-making strategies and dynamic boundaries. Moreover, pedestrians in these multi-agent simulations follow fixed behavior patterns that cannot dynamically respond to AV actions. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework for modeling interactions between the AV and multiple pedestrians. In this framework, a cognitive process modeling approach inspired by the Free Energy Principle is integrated into both the AV and pedestrian models to simulate more realistic interaction dynamics. Specifically, the proposed pedestrian Cognitive-Risk Social Force Model adjusts goal-directed and repulsive forces using a fused measure of cognitive uncertainty and physical risk to produce human-like trajectories. Meanwhile, the AV leverages this fused risk to construct a dynamic, risk-aware adjacency matrix for a Graph Convolutional Network within a Soft Actor-Critic architecture, allowing it to make more reasonable and informed decisions.

{"title": "Cognitive Silicon: An Architectural Blueprint for Post-Industrial Computing Systems", "abstract": "Autonomous AI systems reveal foundational limitations in deterministic, human-authored computing architectures. This paper presents Cognitive Silicon: a hypothetical full-stack architectural framework projected toward 2035, exploring a possible trajectory for cognitive computing system design. The proposed architecture would integrate symbolic scaffolding, governed memory, runtime moral coherence, and alignment-aware execution across silicon-to-semantics layers. Our design grammar has emerged from dialectical co-design with LLMs under asymmetric epistemic conditions--creating structured friction to expose blind spots and trade-offs. The envisioned framework would establish mortality as a natural consequence of physical constraints, non-copyable tacit knowledge, and non-cloneable identity keys as cognitive-embodiment primitives. Core tensions (trust/agency, scaffolding/emergence, execution/governance) would function as central architectural pressures rather than edge cases. The architecture theoretically converges with the Free Energy Principle, potentially offering a formal account of how cognitive systems could maintain identity through prediction error minimization across physical and computational boundaries.

{"title": "The Work Capacity of Channels with Memory: Maximum Extractable Work in Percept-Action Loops", "abstract": "Predicting future observations plays a central role in machine learning, biology, economics, and many other fields. It lies at the heart of organizational principles such as the variational free energy principle and has even been shown -- based on the second law of thermodynamics -- to be necessary for reaching the fundamental energetic limits of sequential information processing. While the usefulness of the predictive paradigm is undisputed, complex adaptive systems that interact with their environment are more than just predictive machines: they have the power to act upon their environment and cause change. In this work, we develop a framework to analyze the thermodynamics of information processing in percept-action loops -- a model of agent-environment interaction -- allowing us to investigate the thermodynamic implications of actions and percepts on equal footing. To this end, we introduce the concept of work capacity -- the maximum rate at which an agent can expect to extract work from its environment. Our results reveal that neither of two previously established design principles for work-efficient agents -- maximizing predictive power and forgetting past actions -- remains optimal in environments where actions have observable consequences. Instead, a trade-off emerges: work-efficient agents must balance prediction and forgetting, as remembering past actions can reduce the available free energy. This highlights a fundamental departure from the thermodynamics of passive observation, suggesting that prediction and energy efficiency may be at odds in active learning systems.", "authors": [{"name": "Lukas J.

Yet some have questioned if the term still has meaning. AGI has been subject to so much hype and speculation it has become something of a Rorschach test. Melanie Mitchell argues the debate will only be settled through long term, scientific investigation. To that end here is a short, accessible and provocative overview of AGI. I compare definitions of intelligence, settling on intelligence in terms of adaptation and AGI as an artificial scientist. Taking my cue from Sutton's Bitter Lesson I describe two foundational tools used to build adaptive systems: search and approximation. I compare pros, cons, hybrids and architectures like o3, AlphaGo, AERA, NARS and Hyperon. I then discuss overall meta-approaches to making systems behave more intelligently. I divide them into scale-maxing, simp-maxing, w-maxing based on the Bitter Lesson, Ockham's and Bennett's Razors. These maximise resources, simplicity of form, and the weakness of constraints on functionality. I discuss examples including AIXI, the free energy principle and The Embiggening of language models. I conclude that though scale-maxed approximation dominates, AGI will be a fusion of tools and meta-approaches. The Embiggening was enabled by improvements in hardware.

Robustness towards these training-environment ambiguities is a core requirement for intelligent agents and its fulfillment is a long-standing challenge towards their real-world deployments. Here, we introduce a Distributionally Robust Free Energy model (DR-FREE) that instills this core property by design. Combining a robust extension of the free energy principle with a resolution engine, DR-FREE wires robustness into the agent decision-making mechanisms. Across benchmark experiments, DR-FREE enables the agents to complete the task even when, in contrast, state-of-the-art models fail.

{"title": "Dynamic Markov Blanket Detection for Macroscopic Physics Discovery", "abstract": "The free energy principle (FEP), along with the associated constructs of Markov blankets and ontological potentials, have recently been presented as the core components of a generalized modeling method capable of mathematically describing arbitrary objects that persist in random dynamical systems; that is, a mathematical theory of ``every'' ``thing''. Here, we leverage the FEP to develop a mathematical physics approach to the identification of objects, object types, and the macroscopic, object-type-specific rules that govern their behavior. We take a generative modeling approach and use variational Bayesian expectation maximization to develop a dynamic Markov blanket detection algorithm that is capable of identifying and classifying macroscopic objects, given partial observation of microscopic dynamics. This unsupervised algorithm uses Bayesian attention to explicitly label observable microscopic elements according to their current role in a given system, as either the internal or boundary elements of a given macroscopic object; and it identifies macroscopic physical laws that govern how the object interacts with its environment. Because these labels are dynamic or evolve over time, the algorithm is capable of identifying complex objects that travel through fixed media or exchange matter with their environment. This approach leads directly to a flexible class of structured, unsupervised algorithms that sensibly partition complex many-particle or many-component systems into collections of interacting macroscopic subsystems, namely, ``objects'' or ``things''. We derive a few examples of this kind of macroscopic physics discovery algorithm and demonstrate its utility with simple numerical experiments, in which the algorithm correctly labels the components of Newton's cradle, a burning fuse, the Lorenz attractor, and a simulated cell.", "authors": [{"name": "Jeff Beck", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Maxwell J.

We propose a minimal FEP model for node behaviour reveals three distinct regimes: when detection noise dominates, agents seek better information, reducing isolated agents compared to expectations from classical preferential attachment. In the optimal detection regime, super-linear growth emerges from compounded improvements in detection, belief, and action, which produce a preferred cluster scale. Finally, saturation effects occur as limits on the agent's information processing capabilities prevent indefinite cluster growth. These regimes produce the knee-shaped degree distributions observed in real networks, explaining them as signatures of agents with optimal information processing under constraints.

This framework naturally accounts for uncertainty in both world model and preference model, allowing for decision-making that is epistemically and axiologically humble, parsimonious, and future-proof. We demonstrate this novel approach in a simplified autonomous vehicle environment with multi-agent vehicles whose driving policies are mediated by gatekeepers that evaluate, in an online fashion, the risk to the collective safety in their neighborhood, and intervene through each vehicle's policy when appropriate.

Currently, many theories have attempted to explain the most essential difference between living systems and general systems, such as the self-organization theory and the free energy principle, but there is a lack of a reasonable indicator that can measure to what extent a system can be regarded as a system with life characteristics, especially the lack of attention to the dynamic characteristics of life systems. In this article, we propose a new indicator at the level of dynamic mechanisms to measure the ability of a system to flexibly respond to the environment. We proved that this indicator satisfies the axiom system of multivariate information decomposition in the partial information decomposition (PID) framework. Through further disassembly and analysis of this indicator, we found that it is determined by the degree of entanglement between system and environmental variables in the dynamics and the magnitude of noise. We conducted measurements on cellular automata (CA), random Boolean networks, and real gene regulatory networks (GRN), verified its relationship with the type of CA and the Langton parameter, and identified that the feedback loops have high abilities to flexibly respond to the environment on the GRN.

{"title": "Balancing Exploration and Cybersickness: Investigating Curiosity-Driven Behavior in Virtual Environments", "abstract": "During virtual navigation, users exhibit varied interaction and navigation behaviors influenced by several factors. Existing theories and models have been developed to explain and predict these diverse patterns. While users often experience uncomfortable sensations, such as cybersickness, during virtual reality (VR) use, they do not always make optimal decisions to mitigate these effects. Although methods like reinforcement learning have been used to model decision-making processes, they typically rely on random selection to simulate actions, failing to capture the complexities of real navigation behavior. In this study, we propose curiosity as a key factor driving irrational decision-making, suggesting that users continuously balance exploration and cybersickness according to the free energy principle during virtual navigation. Our findings show that VR users generally adopt conservative strategies when navigating, with most participants displaying negative curiosity across trials. However, curiosity levels tend to rise when the virtual environment changes, illustrating the dynamic interplay between exploration and discomfort. This study provides a quantitative approach to decoding curiosity-driven behavior during virtual navigation, offering insights into how users balance exploration and the avoidance of cybersickness.

{"title": "Learning by Surprise: Surplexity for Mitigating Model Collapse in Generative AI", "abstract": "As synthetic content increasingly infiltrates the web, generative AI models may be retrained on their own outputs: a process termed \"autophagy\". This leads to model collapse: a progressive loss of performance and diversity across generations. Recent studies have examined the emergence of model collapse across various generative AI models and data types, and have proposed mitigation strategies that rely on incorporating human-authored content. However, current characterizations of model collapse remain limited, and existing mitigation methods assume reliable knowledge of whether training data is human-authored or AI-generated. In this paper, we address these gaps by introducing new measures that characterise collapse directly from a model's next-token probability distributions, rather than from properties of AI-generated text. Using these measures, we show that the degree of collapse depends on the complexity of the initial training set, as well as on the extent of autophagy. Our experiments prompt a new suggestion: that model collapse occurs when a model trains on data that does not \"surprise\" it. We express this hypothesis in terms of the well-known Free Energy Principle in cognitive science. Building on this insight, we propose a practical mitigation strategy: filtering training items by high surplexity, maximising the surprise of the model. Unlike existing methods, this approach does not require distinguishing between human- and AI-generated data. Experiments across datasets and models demonstrate that our strategy is at least as effective as human-data baselines, and even more effective in reducing distributional skewedness.

The contributions are threefold: 1) We compute the entropy production for a greater class of systems than before, including almost any stationary diffusion process, such as degenerate diffusions where the driving noise does not act on all coordinates of the system. Importantly, this class of systems encompasses Markovian approximations of stochastic differential equations driven by colored noise, which is significant since biological systems at the macro- and meso-scale are generally subject to colored fluctuations. 2) We develop a Bayesian mechanics for biological and physical entities that interact with their environment in which we give sufficient and necessary conditions for the internal states of something to infer its external states, consistently with variational Bayesian inference in statistics and theoretical neuroscience. 3) We refine the constraints on Bayesian mechanics to obtain a description that is more specific to biological systems, called the free-energy principle. This says that active and internal states of biological systems unfold as minimising a quantity known as free energy.

The resulting Lagrangian (Hamiltonian) produces a variation of the classic DeGroot dynamics.

These dynamics produce trajectories that resemble flows on tori but are shown numerically to produce chaos near the boundary of the space.

{"title": "A framework for the use of generative modelling in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics", "abstract": "\n We discuss an approach to mathematically modelling systems made of objects that are coupled together, using generative models of the dependence relationships between states (or trajectories) of the things comprising such systems. This broad class includes open or non-equilibrium systems and is especially relevant to self-organizing systems. The ensuing variational free-energy principle (FEP) has certain advantages over using random dynamical systems explicitly, notably, by being more tractable and offering a parsimonious explanation of why the joint system evolves in the way that it does, based on the properties of the coupling between system components. The FEP is a method whose use allows us to build a model of the dynamics of an object as if it were a process of variational inference, because variational free energy (or surprisal) is a Lyapunov function for its dynamics. In short, we argue that using generative models to represent and track relations among subsystems leads us to a particular statistical theory of interacting systems. Conversely, this theory enables us to construct nested models that respect the known relations among subsystems.

{"title": "Intrinsic Rewards for Exploration without Harm from Observational Noise: A Simulation Study Based on the Free Energy Principle", "abstract": "In Reinforcement Learning (RL), artificial agents are trained to maximize numerical rewards by performing tasks. Exploration is essential in RL because agents must discover information before exploiting it. Two rewards encouraging efficient exploration are the entropy of action policy and curiosity for information gain. Entropy is well-established in literature, promoting randomized action selection. Curiosity is defined in a broad variety of ways in literature, promoting discovery of novel experiences. One example, prediction error curiosity, rewards agents for discovering observations they cannot accurately predict. However, such agents may be distracted by unpredictable observational noises known as curiosity traps. Based on the Free Energy Principle (FEP), this paper proposes hidden state curiosity, which rewards agents by the KL divergence between the predictive prior and posterior probabilities of latent variables. We trained six types of agents to navigate mazes: baseline agents without rewards for entropy or curiosity, and agents rewarded for entropy and/or either prediction error curiosity or hidden state curiosity. We find entropy and curiosity result in efficient exploration, especially both employed together. Notably, agents with hidden state curiosity demonstrate resilience against curiosity traps, which hinder agents with prediction error curiosity. This suggests implementing the FEP may enhance the robustness and generalization of RL models, potentially aligning the learning processes of artificial and biological agents.", "authors": [{"name": "Theodore Jerome Tinker", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Kenji Doya", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Jun Tani", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2024, "doi": null, "arxiv_id": "2405.07473", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2024-05-13"}

The current target article represents an important iteration of this research paradigm in formally describing emergent dynamics rather than merely (quasi-)steady states. This affords more in-depth considerations of the spatio-temporal complexities of cross-scale causality - as we have encouraged and built towards in previous publications (e.g., [4-9]).

{"title": "Modeling arousal potential of epistemic emotions using Bayesian information gain: Inquiry cycle driven by free energy fluctuations", "abstract": "Epistemic emotions, such as curiosity and interest, drive the inquiry process. This study proposes a novel formulation of epistemic emotions such as curiosity and interest using two types of information gain generated by the principle of free energy minimization: Kullback-Leibler divergence(KLD) from Bayesian posterior to prior, which represents free energy reduction in recognition, and Bayesian surprise (BS), which represents the expected information gain by Bayesian prior update. By applying a Gaussian generative model with an additional uniform likelihood, we found that KLD and BS form an upward-convex function of surprise (minimized free energy and prediction error), similar to Berlyne's arousal potential functions, or the Wundt curve. We consider that the alternate maximization of BS and KLD generates an ideal inquiry cycle to approach the optimal arousal level with fluctuations in surprise, and that curiosity and interest drive to facilitate the cyclic process. We exhaustively analyzed the effects of prediction uncertainty (prior variance) and observation uncertainty (likelihood variance) on the peaks of the information gain function as optimal surprises. The results show that greater prediction uncertainty, meaning an open-minded attitude, and less observational uncertainty, meaning precise observation with attention, are expected to provide greater information gains through a greater range of exploration. The proposed mathematical framework unifies the free energy principle of the brain and the arousal potential theory to explain the Wundt curve as an information gain function and suggests an ideal inquiry process driven by epistemic emotions.", "authors": [{"name": "Hideyoshi Yanagisawa", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Shimon Honda", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2023, "doi": "10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1438080", "arxiv_id": "2401.00007", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2023-12-14"}

This can be generalized to provide examples of higher forms of metacognition: i.e. particles having beliefs about beliefs about beliefs and so forth.

{"title": "Approximate information maximization for bandit games", "abstract": "Entropy maximization and free energy minimization are general physical principles for modeling the dynamics of various physical systems. Notable examples include modeling decision-making within the brain using the free-energy principle, optimizing the accuracy-complexity trade-off when accessing hidden variables with the information bottleneck principle (Tishby et al., 2000), and navigation in random environments using information maximization (Vergassola et al., 2007). Built on this principle, we propose a new class of bandit algorithms that maximize an approximation to the information of a key variable within the system. To this end, we develop an approximated analytical physics-based representation of an entropy to forecast the information gain of each action and greedily choose the one with the largest information gain. This method yields strong performances in classical bandit settings. Motivated by its empirical success, we prove its asymptotic optimality for the two-armed bandit problem with Gaussian rewards. Owing to its ability to encompass the system's properties in a global physical functional, this approach can be efficiently adapted to more complex bandit settings, calling for further investigation of information maximization approaches for multi-armed bandit problems.", "authors": [{"name": "Alex Barbier-Chebbah", "affiliation": "CELESTE", "orcid": null}, {"name": "Christian L.

{"title": "Local Max-Entropy and Free Energy Principles, Belief Diffusions and their Singularities", "abstract": "A comprehensive picture of three Bethe-Kikuchi variational principles including their relationship to belief propagation (BP) algorithms on hypergraphs is given. The structure of BP equations is generalized to define continuous-time diffusions, solving localized versions of the max-entropy principle (A), the variational free energy principle (B), and a less usual equilibrium free energy principle (C), Legendre dual to A. Both critical points of Bethe-Kikuchi functionals and stationary beliefs are shown to lie at the non-linear intersection of two constraint surfaces, enforcing energy conservation and marginal consistency respectively. The hypersurface of singular beliefs, accross which equilibria become unstable as the constraint surfaces meet tangentially, is described by polynomial equations in the convex polytope of consistent beliefs. This polynomial is expressed by a loop series expansion for graphs of binary variables.", "authors": [{"name": "Olivier Peltre", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2023, "doi": null, "arxiv_id": "2310.02946", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2023-10-04"}
{"title": "Return to Lacan: an approach to digital twin mind with free energy principle", "abstract": "Free energy principle (FEP) is a burgeoning theory in theoretical neuroscience that provides a universal law for modelling living systems of any scale. Expecting a digital twin mind from this first principle, we propose a macro-level interpretation that bridge neuroscience and psychoanalysis through the lens of computational Lacanian psychoanalysis. In this article, we claim three fundamental parallels between FEP and Lacanian psychoanalysis, and suggest a FEP approach to formalizing Lacan's theory. Sharing the non-linear temporal structure that combines prediction and retrospection (logical time), both of two theories focus on epistemological questions that how systems represented themselves and external world, and those elements failed to be represented (lacks and free energy) significantly influence the systems' subsequent states. Additionally, the fundamental hypothesis of FEP that the precise state of environment is always concealed, accounts for object petit a, the core concept in Lacan's theory. With neuropsychoanalytic mapping from three orders (the Real, the Symbolic, and the Imaginary, RSI) onto brain regions, we propose a brain-wide FEP model for a minimal definition of Lacanian mind - composite state of RSI that is perturbated by desire running over the logical time. The FEP-RSI model involves three FEP units connected by respective free energy with a natural compliance with logical time, mimicking core dynamics of Lacanian mind. The biological plausibility of current model is considered from perspectives of cognitive neuroscience. In conclusion, the FEP-RSI model encapsulates a unified framework for digital twin modeling at the macro level.", "authors": [{"name": "Lingyu Li", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Chunbo Li", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2023, "doi": "10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1574650", "arxiv_id": "2309.06707", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2023-09-13"}

Our prior robotic studies using PV-RNN showed that the nature of interactions between top-down expectation and bottom-up inference is strongly affected by a parameter, called the meta-prior, which regulates the complexity term in free energy.The study also compares the counter force generated when trained transitions are induced by a human experimenter and when untrained transitions are induced. Our experimental results indicated that (1) the human experimenter needs more/less force to induce trained transitions when $w$ is set with larger/smaller values, (2) the human experimenter needs more force to act on the robot when he attempts to induce untrained as opposed to trained movement pattern transitions. Our analysis of time development of essential variables and values in PV-RNN during bodily interaction clarified the mechanism by which gaps in actional intentions between the human experimenter and the robot can be manifested as reaction forces between them.", "authors": [{"name": "Hiroki Sawada", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Wataru Ohata", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Jun Tani", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2023, "doi": null, "arxiv_id": "2303.15213", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2023-03-27"}

{"title": "Stochastic Surprisal: An inferential measurement of Free Energy in Neural Networks", "abstract": "This paper conjectures and validates a framework that allows for action during inference in supervised neural networks. Supervised neural networks are constructed with the objective to maximize their performance metric in any given task. This is done by reducing free energy and its associated surprisal during training. However, the bottom-up inference nature of supervised networks is a passive process that renders them fallible to noise. In this paper, we provide a thorough background of supervised neural networks, both generative and discriminative, and discuss their functionality from the perspective of free energy principle. We then provide a framework for introducing action during inference. We introduce a new measurement called stochastic surprisal that is a function of the network, the input, and any possible action. This action can be any one of the outputs that the neural network has learnt, thereby lending stochasticity to the measurement. Stochastic surprisal is validated on two applications: Image Quality Assessment and Recognition under noisy conditions. We show that, while noise characteristics are ignored to make robust recognition, they are analyzed to estimate image quality scores. We apply stochastic surprisal on two applications, three datasets, and as a plug-in on twelve networks. In all, it provides a statistically significant increase among all measures. We conclude by discussing the implications of the proposed stochastic surprisal in other areas of cognitive psychology including expectancy-mismatch and abductive reasoning.", "authors": [{"name": "Mohit Prabhushankar", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Ghassan AlRegib", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2023, "doi": null, "arxiv_id": "2302.05776", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2023-02-11"}

The ensuing account expresses the paths or trajectories that a particle takes as it evolves over time. The main results are a method or principle of least action that can be used to emulate the behaviour of particles in open exchange with their external milieu. Particles are defined by a particular partition, in which internal states are individuated from external states by active and sensory blanket states. The variational principle at hand allows one to interpret internal dynamics-of certain kinds of particles-as inferring external states that are hidden behind blanket states. We consider different kinds of particles, and to what extent they can be imbued with an elementary form of inference or sentience. Specifically, we consider the distinction between dissipative and conservative particles, inert and active particles and, finally, ordinary and strange particles. Strange particles can be described as inferring their own actions, endowing them with apparent autonomy or agency.

{"title": "On the map-territory fallacy fallacy", "abstract": "This paper presents a meta-theory of the usage of the free energy principle (FEP) and examines its scope in the modelling of physical systems. We consider the so-called `map-territory fallacy'and the fallacious reification of model properties. By showing that the FEP is a consistent, physics-inspired theory of inferences of inferences, we disprove the assertion that the map-territory fallacy contradicts the principled usage of the FEP. As such, we argue that deploying the map-territory fallacy to criticise the use of the FEP and Bayesian mechanics itself constitutes a fallacy: what we call the {\\it map-territory fallacy fallacy}. In so doing, we emphasise a few key points: the uniqueness of the FEP as a model of particles or agents that model their environments; the restoration of convention to the FEP via its relation to the principle of constrained maximum entropy; the `Jaynes optimality'of the FEP under this relation; and finally, the way that this meta-theoretical approach to the FEP clarifies its utility and scope as a formal modelling tool. Taken together, these features make the FEP, uniquely, {\\it the} ideal model of generic systems in statistical physics.", "authors": [{"name": "M.

{"title": "The Free Energy Principle drives neuromorphic development", "abstract": "We show how any system with morphological degrees of freedom and locally limited free energy will, under the constraints of the free energy principle, evolve toward a neuromorphic morphology that supports hierarchical computations in which each level of the hierarchy enacts a coarse-graining of its inputs, and dually a fine-graining of its outputs. Such hierarchies occur throughout biology, from the architectures of intracellular signal transduction pathways to the large-scale organization of perception and action cycles in the mammalian brain. Formally, the close formal connections between cone-cocone diagrams (CCCD) as models of quantum reference frames on the one hand, and between CCCDs and topological quantum field theories on the other, allow the representation of such computations in the fully-general quantum-computational framework of topological quantum neural networks.", "authors": [{"name": "Chris Fields", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Karl Friston", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "James F.

{"title": "Local Max-Entropy and Free Energy Principles Solved by Belief Propagation", "abstract": "A statistical system is classically defined on a set of microstates $E$ by a global energy function $H : E \\to \\mathbb{R}$, yielding Gibbs probability measures (softmins) $ρ^β(H)$ for every inverse temperature $β= T^{-1}$. Gibbs states are simultaneously characterized by free energy principles and the max-entropy principle, with dual constraints on inverse temperature $β$ and mean energy ${\\cal U}(β) = \\mathbb{E}_{ρ^β}[H]$ respectively. The Legendre transform relates these diverse variational principles which are unfortunately not tractable in high dimension. The global energy is generally given as a sum $H(x) = \\sum_{\\rm a \\subset Ω} h_{\\rm a}(x_{|\\rm a})$ of local short-range interactions $h_{\\rm a} : E_{\\rm a} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ indexed by bounded subregions ${\\rm a} \\subset Ω$, and this local structure can be used to design good approximation schemes on thermodynamic functionals. We show that the generalized belief propagation (GBP) algorithm solves a collection of local variational principles, by converging to critical points of Bethe-Kikuchi approximations of the free energy $F(β)$, the Shannon entropy $S(\\cal U)$, and the variational free energy ${\\cal F}(β) = {\\cal U} - β^{-1} S(\\cal U)$, extending an initial correspondence by Yedidia et al.

By giving an example about the journey of a person, we believe to show some simple, obvious but mathematically encoded philosophical implications about how we could think, learn and memorize. In this basic model we will separate how we learn from Ignorance, and how we anticipate the world using Bayes formula, both should however be more entangled to best reflect reality. In fact, as we have seen after achieving this work, applying Ignorance on the system constituting a person finally turns out to be the global approach of its local counterpart on systems like neurons, cells and other complex probabilistic systems, described using the free energy principle, a much more complex and detailed approach. The aim of this article is therefore to show, as seen from a person, another aspect of the application of the free energy principle which represents the constrained Shannon's entropy, and leads to Bayes'formula. We show that, using only ignorance as a single quantity, and its minimization as the main process, we can take into account his understandings, assertions, doubts and assumptions about how he perceives the world, by describing them mathematically.", "authors": [{"name": "Cailleteau Thomas", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2022, "doi": null, "arxiv_id": "2206.05684", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2022-06-12"}
{"title": "On Bayesian Mechanics: A Physics of and by Beliefs", "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to introduce a field of study that has emerged over the last decade called Bayesian mechanics. Bayesian mechanics is a probabilistic mechanics, comprising tools that enable us to model systems endowed with a particular partition (i.e., into particles), where the internal states (or the trajectories of internal states) of a particular system encode the parameters of beliefs about external states (or their trajectories). These tools allow us to write down mechanical theories for systems that look as if they are estimating posterior probability distributions over the causes of their sensory states. This provides a formal language for modelling the constraints, forces, potentials, and other quantities determining the dynamics of such systems, especially as they entail dynamics on a space of beliefs (i.e., on a statistical manifold). Here, we will review the state of the art in the literature on the free energy principle, distinguishing between three ways in which Bayesian mechanics has been applied to particular systems (i.e., path-tracking, mode-tracking, and mode-matching). We go on to examine a duality between the free energy principle and the constrained maximum entropy principle, both of which lie at the heart of Bayesian mechanics, and discuss its implications.", "authors": [{"name": "Maxwell J.

In the target article, the authors analyzed certain sparsely coupled stochastic differential equations whose non-equilibrium steady-state densities are claimed--in previous FEP literature--to have a Markov blanket. The authors demonstrate that in general, Markov blankets are not guaranteed to follow from sparse coupling. The current commentary explains the relationship between sparse coupling and Markov blankets in the case of Gaussian steady-state densities. We precisely derive conditions under which causal coupling leads--or does not lead--to Markov blankets. Importantly, our derivations hold for both linear and non-linear stochastic differential equations. This result may shed light on the sorts of systems which we expect to have Markov blankets.

{"title": "Particular flows and attracting sets: A comment on \"How particular is the physics of the Free Energy Principle?\" by Aguilera, Millidge, Tschantz and Buckley", "abstract": "In this commentary, I expand on the analysis of the recent article \"How particular is the physics of the Free Energy Principle?\" by Aguilera et al. by studying the flow fields of linear diffusions, and particularly the rotation of their attracting sets in the presence of different types of solenoidal coupling. This analysis sheds new light on previous claims made in the FEP literature (and contested in the target article) that the internal dynamics of stochastic systems can be cast performing a gradient flow on variational free energy, and thus endowed with an inferential interpretation, i.e., as if internal states are performing inference about states external to the system. I express general agreement with the target article's statement that the marginal flow of internal states does not point along variational free energy gradients evaluated at the most likely internal state (i.e., the conditional mode). However, in this commentary I focus on the flow of particular states (internal and blanket states) and their variational free energy gradients, and show that for a wide but restricted class of solenoidal couplings, the average flow of these systems point along variational free energy gradients. This licenses a different but perhaps stronger re-description of the flow of particular states as performing inference, which importantly holds at arbitrary points in state space, not just at the conditional modes.", "authors": [{"name": "Conor Heins", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2022, "doi": "10.1016/j.plrev.2022.06.003", "arxiv_id": "2205.09595", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2022-05-19"}

{"title": "Towards a Geometry and Analysis for Bayesian Mechanics", "abstract": ". In this paper, a simple case of Bayesian mechanics under the free energy principle is formulated in axiomatic terms. We argue that any dynamical system with constraints on its dynamics necessarily looks as though it is performing inference against these constraints, and that in a non-isolated system, such constraints imply external environmental variables embedding the system. Using aspects of classical dynamical systems theory in statistical mechanics, we show that this inference is equivalent to a gradient ascent on the Shannon entropy functional, recovering an approximate Bayesian inference under a locally ergodic probability measure on the state space. We also use some geometric notions from dynamical systems theory—namely, that the constraints constitute a gauge degree of freedom—to elaborate on how the desire to stay self-organised can be read as a gauge force acting on the system. In doing so, a number of results of independent interest are given. Overall, we provide a related, but alternative, formalism to those driven purely by descriptions of random dynamical systems, and take a further step towards a comprehensive statement of the physics of self-organisation in formal mathematical language.", "authors": [{"name": "D.

Here, our simulation study using a multimodal hierarchical recurrent neural network model, based on variational free-energy minimization, shows that a mechanism for sensory attenuation can develop through learning of two distinct types of sensorimotor experience, involving self-produced or externally produced exteroceptions. For each sensorimotor context, a particular free-energy state emerged through interaction between top-down prediction with precision and bottom-up sensory prediction error from each sensory area. The executive area in the network served as an information hub. Consequently, shifts between the two sensorimotor contexts triggered transitions from one free-energy state to another in the network via executive control, which caused shifts between attenuating and amplifying prediction-error-induced responses in the sensory areas.

{"title": "A Mathematical Walkthrough and Discussion of the Free Energy Principle", "abstract": "The Free-Energy-Principle (FEP) is an influential and controversial theory which postulates a deep connection between the stochastic thermodynamics of self-organization and learning through variational inference. Specifically, it claims that any self-organizing system which can be statistically separated from its environment, and which maintains itself at a non-equilibrium steady state, can be construed as minimizing an information-theoretic functional – the variational free energy – and thus performing variational Bayesian inference to infer the hidden state of its environment. This principle has also been applied extensively in neuroscience, and is beginning to make inroads in machine learning by spurring the construction of novel algorithms by which action, perception, and learning can all be unified under a single objective. While its expansive and often grandiose claims have spurred significant debates in both philosophy and theoretical neuroscience, the mathematical depth and lack of accessible introductions and tutorials for the core claims of the theory have often made productive discussion challenging. Here, we aim to provide a mathematically detailed, yet intuitive walk-through of the formulation and central claims of the FEP while also providing a discussion of the assumptions necessary and potential limitations of the theory. Additionally, since the FEP is a living theory, subject to internal controversy, change, and revision, we also present a detailed appendix highlighting and condensing current perspectives as well as controversies about the nature, applicability, and the mathematical assumptions and formalisms underlying the FEP. ar X iv :2 10 8. 13 34 3v 2 [ cs .A I] 1 O ct 2 02 1 A PREPRINT 5TH OCTOBER, 2021", "authors": [{"name": "Beren Millidge", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "A.

{"title": "Reinforced Imitation Learning by Free Energy Principle", "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) requires a large amount of exploration especially in sparse-reward settings. Imitation Learning (IL) can learn from expert demonstrations without exploration, but it never exceeds the expert's performance and is also vulnerable to distributional shift between demonstration and execution. In this paper, we radically unify RL and IL based on Free Energy Principle (FEP). FEP is a unified Bayesian theory of the brain that explains perception, action and model learning by a common fundamental principle. We present a theoretical extension of FEP and derive an algorithm in which an agent learns the world model that internalizes expert demonstrations and at the same time uses the model to infer the current and future states and actions that maximize rewards. The algorithm thus reduces exploration costs by partially imitating experts as well as maximizing its return in a seamless way, resulting in a higher performance than the suboptimal expert. Our experimental results show that this approach is promising in visual control tasks especially in sparse-reward environments.", "authors": [{"name": "Ryoya Ogishima", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Izumi Karino", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Yasuo Kuniyoshi", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2021, "doi": null, "arxiv_id": "2107.11811", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2021-07-25"}
{"title": "Bounded rationality for relaxing best response and mutual consistency: The Quantal Hierarchy model of decision-making", "abstract": "While game theory has been transformative for decision-making, the assumptions made can be overly restrictive in certain instances. In this work, we investigate some of the underlying assumptions of rationality, such as mutual consistency and best response, and consider ways to relax these assumptions using concepts from level-$k$ reasoning and quantal response equilibrium (QRE) respectively. Specifically, we propose an information-theoretic two-parameter model called the Quantal Hierarchy model, which can relax both mutual consistency and best response while still approximating level-$k$, QRE, or typical Nash equilibrium behaviour in the limiting cases. The model is based on a recursive form of the variational free energy principle, representing higher-order reasoning as (pseudo) sequential decision-making in extensive-form game tree. This representation enables us to treat simultaneous games in a similar manner to sequential games, where reasoning resources deplete throughout the game-tree. Bounds in player processing abilities are captured as information costs, where future branches of reasoning are discounted, implying a hierarchy of players where lower-level players have fewer processing resources. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the Quantal Hierarchy model in several canonical economic games, {both simultaneous and sequential}, using out-of-sample modelling.", "authors": [{"name": "Benjamin Patrick Evans", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Mikhail Prokopenko", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2021, "doi": null, "arxiv_id": "2106.15844", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2021-06-30"}
{"title": "How particular is the physics of the free energy principle?", "abstract": "The free energy principle (FEP) states that any dynamical system can be interpreted as performing Bayesian inference upon its surrounding environment. Although, in theory, the FEP applies to a wide variety of systems, there has been almost no direct exploration or demonstration of the principle in concrete systems. In this work, we examine in depth the assumptions required to derive the FEP in the simplest possible set of systems – weakly-coupled non-equilibrium linear stochastic systems. Specifically, we explore (i) how general the requirements imposed on the statistical structure of a system are and (ii) how informative the FEP is about the behaviour of such systems. We discover that two requirements of the FEP – the Markov blanket condition (i.e. a statistical boundary precluding direct coupling between internal and external states) and stringent restrictions on its solenoidal flows (i.e. tendencies driving a system out of equilibrium) – are only valid for a very narrow space of parameters. Suitable systems require an absence of perception-action asymmetries that is highly unusual for living systems interacting with an environment. More importantly, we observe that a mathematically central step in the argument, connecting the behaviour of a system to variational inference, relies on an implicit equivalence between the dynamics of the average states of a system with the average of the dynamics of those states. This equivalence does not hold in general even for linear stochastic systems, since it requires an effective decoupling from the system's history of interactions. These observations are critical for evaluating the generality and applicability of the FEP and indicate the existence of significant problems of the theory in its current form.

{"title": "A synapse-centric account of the free energy principle", "abstract": "The free energy principle (FEP) is a mathematical framework that describes how biological systems self-organize and survive in their environment. This principle provides insights on multiple scales, from high-level behavioral and cognitive functions such as attention or foraging, down to the dynamics of specialized cortical microcircuits, suggesting that the FEP manifests on several levels of brain function. Here, we apply the FEP to one of the smallest functional units of the brain: single excitatory synaptic connections. By focusing on an experimentally well understood biological system we are able to derive learning rules from first principles while keeping assumptions minimal. This synapse-centric account of the FEP predicts that synapses interact with the soma of the post-synaptic neuron through stochastic synaptic releases to probe their behavior and use back-propagating action potentials as feedback to update the synaptic weights. The emergent learning rules are regulated triplet STDP rules that depend only on the timing of the pre- and post-synaptic spikes and the internal states of the synapse. The parameters of the learning rules are fully determined by the parameters of the post-synaptic neuron model, suggesting a close interplay between the synaptic and somatic compartment and making precise predictions about the synaptic dynamics. The synapse-level uncertainties automatically lead to representations of uncertainty on the network level that manifest in ambiguous situations. We show that the FEP learning rules can be applied to spiking neural networks for supervised and unsupervised learning and for a closed loop learning task where a behaving agent interacts with an environment.", "authors": [{"name": "David Kappel", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Christian Tetzlaff", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2021, "doi": null, "arxiv_id": "2103.12649", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2021-03-23"}
{"title": "Rethinking Neural Networks With Benford's Law", "abstract": "Benford's Law (BL) or the Significant Digit Law defines the probability distribution of the first digit of numerical values in a data sample. This Law is observed in many naturally occurring datasets. It can be seen as a measure of naturalness of a given distribution and finds its application in areas like anomaly and fraud detection. In this work, we address the following question: Is the distribution of the Neural Network parameters related to the network's generalization capability? To that end, we first define a metric, MLH (Model Enthalpy), that measures the closeness of a set of numbers to Benford's Law and we show empirically that it is a strong predictor of Validation Accuracy. Second, we use MLH as an alternative to Validation Accuracy for Early Stopping, removing the need for a Validation set. We provide experimental evidence that even if the optimal size of the validation set is known before-hand, the peak test accuracy attained is lower than not using a validation set at all. Finally, we investigate the connection of BL to Free Energy Principle and First Law of Thermodynamics, showing that MLH is a component of the internal energy of the learning system and optimization as an analogy to minimizing the total energy to attain equilibrium.", "authors": [{"name": "Surya Kant Sahu", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Abhinav Java", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Arshad Shaikh", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Yannic Kilcher", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2021, "doi": null, "arxiv_id": "2102.03313", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2021-02-05"}

{"title": "Sensorimotor Visual Perception on Embodied System Using Free Energy Principle", "abstract": "We propose an embodied system based on the free energy principle (FEP) for sensorimotor visual perception. We evaluated it in a character-recognition task using the MNIST dataset. Although the FEP has successfully described a rule that living things obey mathematically and claims that a biological system continues to change its internal models and behaviors to minimize the difference in predicting sensory input, it is not enough to model sensorimotor visual perception. An embodiment of the system is the key to achieving sensorimotor visual perception. The proposed embodied system is configured by a body and memory. The body has an ocular motor system controlling the direction of eye gaze, which means that the eye can only observe a small focused area of the environment. The memory is not photographic, but is a generative model implemented with a variational autoencoder that contains prior knowledge about the environment, and that knowledge is classified. By limiting body and memory abilities and operating according to the FEP, the embodied system repeatedly takes action to obtain the next sensory input based on various potentials of future sensory inputs. In the evaluation, the inference of the environment was represented as an approximate posterior distribution of characters (0 - 9). As the number of repetitions increased, the attention area moved continuously, gradually reducing the uncertainty of characters. Finally, the probability of the correct character became the highest among the characters. Changing the initial attention position provides a different final distribution, suggesting that the proposed system has a confirmation bias.", "authors": [{"name": "Kanako Esaki", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Tadayuki Matsumura", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Kiyoto Ito", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "H.

{"title": "DynamicEmbedding: Extending TensorFlow for Colossal-Scale Applications", "abstract": "One of the limitations of deep learning models with sparse features today stems from the predefined nature of their input, which requires a dictionary be defined prior to the training. With this paper we propose both a theory and a working system design which remove this limitation, and show that the resulting models are able to perform better and efficiently run at a much larger scale. Specifically, we achieve this by decoupling a model's content from its form to tackle architecture evolution and memory growth separately. To efficiently handle model growth, we propose a new neuron model, called DynamicCell, drawing inspiration from from the free energy principle [15] to introduce the concept of reaction to discharge non-digestive energy, which also subsumes gradient descent based approaches as its special cases. We implement DynamicCell by introducing a new server into TensorFlow to take over most of the work involving model growth. Consequently, it enables any existing deep learning models to efficiently handle arbitrary number of distinct sparse features (e.g., search queries), and grow incessantly without redefining the model. Most notably, one of our models, which has been reliably running in production for over a year, is capable of suggesting high quality keywords for advertisers of Google Smart Campaigns and achieved significant accuracy gains based on a challenging metric -- evidence that data-driven, self-evolving systems can potentially exceed the performance of traditional rule-based approaches.", "authors": [{"name": "Yun Zeng", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Siqi Zuo", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Dongcai Shen", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2020, "doi": null, "arxiv_id": "2004.08366", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2020-04-17"}

{"title": "A technical critique of the free energy principle as presented in \"Life as we know it\" and related works", "abstract": "We summarize the argument in Friston (2013, this https URL) and highlight some technical errors. We also discuss how these errors affect the very similar Friston (2014, this https URL) and, where appropriate, mention consequences for the newer proposals in Friston (2019, arXiv:1906.10184v1 ) and Parr et al. (2019, this https URL). The errors call into question the purported interpretation that the internal coordinates of every system with a Markov blanket will appear to engage in Bayesian inference. In particular, in addition to highlighting the implicit restriction to linear models, we identify three formal errors in the main argument of Friston (2013): The first concerns the rewriting of the equations of motion of systems with Markov blankets which turns out not to be generally correct. We prove the non-equivalence with a counterexample that exhibits a Markov blanket but does not satisfy the rewritten equations. Our counterexample also invalidates the corresponding (but more general) rewritten equations in the more recent Friston (2019). The second error concerns the Free Energy Lemma itself, which we prove, by counterexample, to be wrong in general. The third is the claim that the Free Energy Lemma, when it does hold, implies equality of variational density and ergodic conditional density. The interpretation in terms of Bayesian inference hinges on this point, and we hence conclude that it is unjustified. Additionally, we highlight that the definitions of the Markov blanket in Friston (2013) and Parr et al. (2019) are not equivalent and that the assumptions in Parr et al. (2019) may be too strong to allow for meaningful interpretation.", "authors": [{"name": "Martin Biehl", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "F. A.

{"title": "The Poincaré-Boltzmann Machine: from Statistical Physics to Machine Learning and back", "abstract": "This paper presents the computational methods of information cohomology applied to genetic expression in and in the companion paper and proposes its interpretations in terms of statistical physics and machine learning. In order to further underline the Hochschild cohomological nature af information functions and chain rules, following, the computation of the cohomology in low degrees is detailed to show more directly that the $k$ multivariate mutual-informations (I_k) are k-coboundaries. The k-cocycles condition corresponds to I_k=0, generalizing statistical independence. Hence the cohomology quantifies the statistical dependences and the obstruction to factorization. The topological approach allows to investigate information in the multivariate case without the assumptions of independent identically distributed variables and without mean field approximations. We develop the computationally tractable subcase of simplicial information cohomology represented by entropy H_k and information I_k landscapes and their respective paths. The I_1 component defines a self-internal energy U_k, and I_k,k>1 components define the contribution to a free energy G_k (the total correlation) of the k-body interactions. The set of information paths in simplicial structures is in bijection with the symmetric group and random processes, provides a trivial topological expression of the 2nd law of thermodynamic. The local minima of free-energy, related to conditional information negativity, and conditional independence, characterize a minimum free energy complex. This complex formalizes the minimum free-energy principle in topology, provides a definition of a complex system, and characterizes a multiplicity of local minima that quantifies the diversity observed in biology. I give an interpretation of this complex in terms of frustration in glass and of Van Der Walls k-body interactions for data points.", "authors": [{"name": "Pierre Baudot", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2019, "doi": null, "arxiv_id": "1907.06486", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2019-07-06"}
{"title": "A free energy principle for a particular physics", "abstract": "This monograph attempts a theory of every 'thing' that can be distinguished from other things in a statistical sense. The ensuing statistical independencies, mediated by Markov blankets, speak to a recursive composition of ensembles (of things) at increasingly higher spatiotemporal scales. This decomposition provides a description of small things; e.g., quantum mechanics - via the Schrodinger equation, ensembles of small things - via statistical mechanics and related fluctuation theorems, through to big things - via classical mechanics. These descriptions are complemented with a Bayesian mechanics for autonomous or active things. Although this work provides a formulation of every thing, its main contribution is to examine the implications of Markov blankets for self-organisation to nonequilibrium steady-state. In brief, we recover an information geometry and accompanying free energy principle that allows one to interpret the internal states of something as representing or making inferences about its external states. The ensuing Bayesian mechanics is compatible with quantum, statistical and classical mechanics and may offer a formal description of lifelike particles.", "authors": [{"name": "Karl J.

{"title": "The principles of adaptation in organisms and machines I: machine learning, information theory, and thermodynamics", "abstract": "How do organisms recognize their environment by acquiring knowledge about the world, and what actions do they take based on this knowledge? This article examines hypotheses about organisms' adaptation to the environment from machine learning, information-theoretic, and thermodynamic perspectives. We start with constructing a hierarchical model of the world as an internal model in the brain, and review standard machine learning methods to infer causes by approximately learning the model under the maximum likelihood principle. This in turn provides an overview of the free energy principle for an organism, a hypothesis to explain perception and action from the principle of least surprise. Treating this statistical learning as communication between the world and brain, learning is interpreted as a process to maximize information about the world. We investigate how the classical theories of perception such as the infomax principle relates to learning the hierarchical model. We then present an approach to the recognition and learning based on thermodynamics, showing that adaptation by causal learning results in the second law of thermodynamics whereas inference dynamics that fuses observation with prior knowledge forms a thermodynamic process. These provide a unified view on the adaptation of organisms to the environment.", "authors": [{"name": "Hideaki Shimazaki", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2019, "doi": null, "arxiv_id": "1902.11233", "s2_id": "3221970526419086994ce34b41e3a1a4a840b9e2", "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 6, "references": ["s2:b3647d075a58874082933fc61c11b8b2643f7ed4", "s2:94b1e47db9853934f450b386111d651e934e8319", "s2:666f5c76ecbe9a955c147fd064359f5de3b9f8ad", "s2:9884d18f265f9178ff9862d53cacbbc9957ddc4c", "s2:7ce2d5677d3c7477a84e8df213ff7bbd80e7e530", "s2:754b657330b1674d3453e8254d3a664db5222b3b", "s2:68385eefed6e869ccc4a6bc490175b6c8c5951b3", "s2:57070167d647bfa23bc5c5895623af13576db66b", "s2:60b7cb1e5bd0c699c5cb7c0568238f8507a4f4fe", "s2:4b32db3236bd1d20b7f4cddd63af385abb00c88c", "s2:70082ac7f3a15874f8f83a0bf8289084dc3e5f44", "s2:7fd488db5a9882cba16cb7e810fe1bbdf5494d7c", "s2:6f24d7a6e1c88828e18d16c6db20f5329f6a6827", "s2:5551a35588ae56ad96590fb1bbf2dacaf05d79e3", "s2:092fec9be78eebca936aaa6f1f5ebf0ec6fb9c81", "s2:666326d42eed3a332ed58e7e34d0989a8e46ecec", "s2:85e4b633642956d74c05d726c2b77a4c3697be83", "s2:df0a65404628f933293c4296c07f585f17743ed6", "s2:7f8e93066a454cf8b6d2919a9dc58a895371abea", "s2:32440dc71cbd9030089ce1b5c291871d6c4cfa6b", "s2:bbab6293783b741729f4f1636b9267e085aa329f", "s2:2a3203324d21a1c8eac20b7b5579f0cf4fb768b3", "s2:988c60e6ced1aa380e140057eacb1e866d21a1e3", "s2:693811976c6dfb7ef9a0ab801ab9f1944d1ec87a", "s2:50d548af47e5003e96bafb4ce4119a75c0a6d403", "s2:42998f6a0ef243ffb5555ced81319ea5e8bba788", "s2:0bbba72496c1390dbb6cb2d4eba661f182971fe7", "s2:04bc5da3f1e62a68f03692182ac4fededf9d1518", "s2:ebc69073614f68836121d1504d0725f5469ece95", "s2:026337ea8a250ea4fae21fe18ed03e4d9ace7d83", "s2:5e6f29a85cce83f6b7cb87edd6a4f5a2f6b81cfd", "s2:e21a4f0cd158136ad396df00d859373e8542490b", "s2:407bb3034daac0fb4fba3d4c09ef3a26dfbfcf5f", "s2:1ed6a4a10589618d4f26350f1a296ee767ceff6b", "s2:5e07da2914783a21980ecc1cea688d1333e6b6e4", "s2:28d6b2370d930efd4c48f74bb28026b311b4777c", "s2:1a014a076cac3c7f5d81a084e296c095f9230437", "s2:5c2dd14c18397c27d8d370194bf905c37ed1c42a", "s2:462ebec7d0865d79a74e2b61b5758a4d51b96fbf", "s2:668b1277fbece28c4841eeab1c97e4ebd0079700", "s2:641a9d87b9636d4ef2e353a569ddede68bd29131", "s2:aebd8bab5cff769fed204dba35112e364a47e504", "s2:2af18c7b3495955d1ffa4f1b4c4ae5ea786cdedb", "s2:0ea24ffe3bee9faeeead947c6c7ab00c99f5ccf2", "s2:5042cb5efad30f443adef472b8748e1b7bb0452f", "s2:5127759530ce213f488af2859190697770f557f3", "s2:66f881a623662f52bb1f84297a098da6b4fa125b", "s2:561b6f0ea628a70e5170b4fef920ebc3f6f63907", "s2:48f4c6eef3626aeec4d5d7cc48f8800933d2c4c3", "s2:418d4bfd63a55555e18a5ad3ad8ef6036ee3c667", "s2:45b7e3d601c072b9f3930542b0c3b953d8666a26", "s2:2805537bec87a6177037b18f9a3a9d3f1038867b", "s2:3f3527ffc3de56afefb0747877ed0179986809a8", "s2:8012c4a1e2ca663f1a04e80cbb19631a00cbab27", "s2:605402e235bd62437baf3c9ebefe77fb4d92ee95", "s2:3dc3a0efe58eaf8564ca1965c0ffd23ec495b83f", "s2:841cd4a6cac86fa0cfb0e8542eac5ed164f23f50", "s2:effea397115304d32b954ac3e7fe69ed8c3fe3c3", "s2:9661ec3cbf05946a569d5920f697cd5dd2ee2c58", "s2:16d70e8af45ca0ae2c1bb73f3be6628518d40b8f", "s2:aeb37769d72999bcbfb0582b73607fd8d23f4545", "s2:26576b057da71ce154739c1353e6df94803c9b23", "s2:420c02bdc487338dbda64feb7491dcf9fb412f17", "s2:31563f05a426debb54a2f2d51335cb90d8920124", "s2:d36efb9ad91e00faa334b549ce989bfae7e2907a", "s2:16a4b9d3bdd0fdd9703bf787f6c17ca7aed55c3b", "s2:a6a1f2d274ab009113a275fa57858535179a7845", "s2:6d0198460198fdb49b89d1646049712b3a0683df", "s2:3c3371817c9c4bc486cef49e5b4c54559886ac01", "s2:bd6230a24b522e9cdd917131966d634cb7db7ba1", "s2:6a8366fb07e43d098d00b3ae8d1bf882b85135b0", "s2:c025b4dc216e83a897d36975a94f890552bd5c2d", "s2:76e0272c24e0feef1601df1b83df71f8e7a3da37", "s2:4f1e3cb24351903d936624417383b5049de24169", "s2:f7f15848cd0fbb3d08f351595da833b1627de9c3", "s2:81b30773d4d404649cebdbb2581d0fdbed941d2a", "s2:d5ad1fdd277219257c38df86770c9fd68f4c74f0", "s2:e1815e539a87ffa558c15be8d3aefd7704c00f73", "s2:a424ec3b8846f57b8ffdb566d272e28d5a525909", "s2:46909441dd40badf6f2f1a815dcdfb295bb194ef", "s2:698aedd44c51da829228e2c7d243960345efeb94", "s2:65df0a46ca89aceb0be201b45da2af2c7618ab32", "s2:c71392148643ef0cb0b9e047e8056422d458fdd9", "s2:16d7bf89304a45f349e9e55ff6fb6a4239d1e66d", "s2:06cb198e97883a7d396e805231a794e4e65276b1", "s2:9c422194b1c7cc8b6c001929305ecf98ee4e4360"], "publication_date": null}

We find that specialization allows to focus on fewer tasks, thus leading to a more efficient execution, but in turn requires coordination in hierarchical structures of specialized experts and coordinating units.

The free energy principle is accordingly rephrased as that for autopoietic reasons all viable organisms attempt to minimize the sensory uncertainty about the unpredictable environment over a temporal horizon. By varying the informational action, we derive the brain's recognition dynamics which conducts the adaptive inference of the external causes of sensory data with addressing only canonical positions and momenta of the brain's representations of the dynamical world. To manifest the utility of our theory, we provide how the neural computation may be implemented biophysically at a single-cell level and subsequently be scaled up to a large-scale functional architecture of the brain.

We derive generalized sequential optimality equations that not only include the Bellman optimality equations as a limit case, but also lead to well-known decision-rules such as Expectimax, Minimax and Expectiminimax. We show how these decision-rules can be derived from a single free energy principle that assigns a resource parameter to each node in the decision tree. These resource parameters express a concrete computational cost that can be measured as the amount of samples that are needed from the distribution that belongs to each node. The free energy principle therefore provides the normative basis for generalized optimality equations that account for both adversarial and stochastic environments.", "authors": [{"name": "Pedro A.

{"title": "Learning in embodied action-perception loops through exploration", "abstract": "Although exploratory behaviors are ubiquitous in the animal kingdom, their computational underpinnings are still largely unknown. Behavioral Psychology has identified learning as a primary drive underlying many exploratory behaviors. Exploration is seen as a means for an animal to gather sensory data useful for reducing its ignorance about the environment. While related problems have been addressed in Data Mining and Reinforcement Learning, the computational modeling of learning-driven exploration by embodied agents is largely unrepresented. \nHere, we propose a computational theory for learning-driven exploration based on the concept of missing information that allows an agent to identify informative actions using Bayesian inference. We demonstrate that when embodiment constraints are high, agents must actively coordinate their actions to learn efficiently. Compared to earlier approaches, our exploration policy yields more efficient learning across a range of worlds with diverse structures. The improved learning in turn affords greater success in general tasks including navigation and reward gathering.

The characteristics of a Darwinian process are developed including the consequences of accumulated adaptations resulting in adaptive systems operating in accordance with Friston's free energy principle and employing environmental simulations. Quantum theory, as developed in Zurek's research program and encapsulated by his theory of Quantum Darwinism is discussed from the view that Zurek's derivation of the measurement axioms implies that the evolution of a quantum system entangled with environmental entities is determined solely by the nature of the entangled system. There need be no further logical foundation. Quantum Darwinism is found to conform to the Darwinian paradigm in unexpected detail and is thus may be considered a theory within the framework of Universal Darwinism. With the inclusion of Quantum Darwinism within Universal Darwinism and the explanatory power of Darwinian processes extended beyond biology and the social sciences to include the creation and evolution of scientific subject matter within particle physics, atomic physics and chemistry, it is suggested that Universal Darwinism may be considered a candidate 'Theory of Everything' as anticipated by David Deutsch.", "authors": [{"name": "John Campbell", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2010, "doi": null, "arxiv_id": "1001.0745", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2010-01-05"}

Inspired by cognitive theories of event perception and predictive coding, we propose EASE, a self-supervised framework that unifies spatiotemporal representation learning and embodied control through free energy minimization. EASE leverages prediction errors and entropy as intrinsic signals to segment events, summarize observations, and actively track salient actors, operating without explicit annotations or external rewards. By coupling a generative perception model with an action-driven control policy, EASE dynamically aligns predictions with observations, enabling emergent behaviors such as implicit memory, target continuity, and adaptability to novel environments.

In this work, we investigate a Bayesian extension to PC that estimates a posterior distribution over network parameters. This approach, termed Bayesian Predictive coding (BPC), preserves the locality of PC and results in closed-form Hebbian weight updates. Compared to PC, our BPC algorithm converges in fewer epochs in the full-batch setting and remains competitive in the mini-batch setting. Additionally, we demonstrate that BPC offers uncertainty quantification comparable to existing methods in Bayesian deep learning, while also improving convergence properties.

We study the emergence of feature detection function from the perspective of tradeoff between energetic cost $E$ and information robustness, and implement this tradeoff by a thermodynamic free energy. We define $E$ as the mean $L_1$-norm of the internal state vectors, and quantify the level of information robustness by an entropy measure $S$. There are at least three types of optimal LPC matrices, one type with very weak synaptic weights and $S \\approx 0$, and two functional types either with low energy $E$ or with high entropy $S$ in which one single unit selectively responds to the non-Gaussian input feature.

Here, we introduce FOND (Free energy Online Natural-gradient Dynamics), a framework that derives neural inference dynamics from three principles: (1) natural gradients on F, (2) online belief updating, and (3) iterative refinement. We apply FOND to derive iP-VAE (iterative Poisson variational autoencoder), a recurrent spiking neural network that performs variational inference through membrane potential dynamics, replacing amortized encoders with iterative inference updates. Theoretically, iP-VAE yields several desirable features such as emergent normalization via lateral competition, and hardware-efficient integer spike count representations. Empirically, iP-VAE outperforms both standard VAEs and Gaussian-based predictive coding models in sparsity, reconstruction, and biological plausibility, and scales to complex color image datasets such as CelebA. iP-VAE also exhibits strong generalization to out-of-distribution inputs, exceeding hybrid iterative-amortized VAEs.

{"title": "Adaptive robot body learning and estimation through predictive coding", "abstract": "The predictive functions that permit humans to infer their body state by sensorimotor integration are critical to perform safe interaction in complex environments. These functions are adaptive and robust to non-linear actuators and noisy sensory information. This paper introduces a computational perceptual model based on predictive processing that enables any multisensory robot to learn, infer and update its body configuration when using arbitrary sensors with Gaussian additive noise. The proposed method integrates different sources of information (tactile, visual and proprioceptive) to drive the robot belief to its current body configuration. The motivation is to enable robots with the embodied perception needed for self-calibration and safe physical human-robot interaction. We formulate body learning as obtaining the forward model that encodes the sensor values depending on the body variables, and we solve it by Gaussian process regression. We model body estimation as minimizing the discrepancy between the robot body configuration belief and the observed posterior. We minimize the variational free energy using the sensory prediction errors (sensed vs expected). In order to evaluate the model we test it on a real multisensory robotic arm. We show how different sensor modalities contributions, included as additive errors, improve the refinement of the body estimation and how the system adapts itself to provide the most plausible solution even when injecting strong sensory visuo-tactile perturbations. We further analyse the reliability of the model when different sensor modalities are disabled.

{"title": "Dream to Explore: Adaptive Simulations for Autonomous Systems", "abstract": "One's ability to learn a generative model of the world without supervision depends on the extent to which one can construct abstract knowledge representations that generalize across experiences. To this end, capturing an accurate statistical structure from observational data provides useful inductive biases that can be transferred to novel environments. Here, we tackle the problem of learning to control dynamical systems by applying Bayesian nonparametric methods, which is applied to solve visual servoing tasks. This is accomplished by first learning a state space representation, then inferring environmental dynamics and improving the policies through imagined future trajectories. Bayesian nonparametric models provide automatic model adaptation, which not only combats underfitting and overfitting, but also allows the model's unbounded dimension to be both flexible and computationally tractable. By employing Gaussian processes to discover latent world dynamics, we mitigate common data efficiency issues observed in reinforcement learning and avoid introducing explicit model bias by describing the system's dynamics. Our algorithm jointly learns a world model and policy by optimizing a variational lower bound of a log-likelihood with respect to the expected free energy minimization objective function.

{"title": "Exploration and preference satisfaction trade-off in reward-free learning", "abstract": "Biological agents have meaningful interactions with their environment despite the absence of immediate reward signals. In such instances, the agent can learn preferred modes of behaviour that lead to predictable states -- necessary for survival. In this paper, we pursue the notion that this learnt behaviour can be a consequence of reward-free preference learning that ensures an appropriate trade-off between exploration and preference satisfaction. For this, we introduce a model-based Bayesian agent equipped with a preference learning mechanism (pepper) using conjugate priors. These conjugate priors are used to augment the expected free energy planner for learning preferences over states (or outcomes) across time. Importantly, our approach enables the agent to learn preferences that encourage adaptive behaviour at test time. We illustrate this in the OpenAI Gym FrozenLake and the 3D mini-world environments -- with and without volatility. Given a constant environment, these agents learn confident (i.e., precise) preferences and act to satisfy them. Conversely, in a volatile setting, perpetual preference uncertainty maintains exploratory behaviour. Our experiments suggest that learnable (reward-free) preferences entail a trade-off between exploration and preference satisfaction.

Self-reproduction may be considered the definition of life [5], and the dynamics it induces are of interest to those concerned with living systems from biology to economics. Trajectories of GBM are distributed according to the well-known log-normal density, broadening with time. However, in many applications, what's of interest is not a single trajectory but the sum, or average, of several trajectories. The distribution of these objects is more complicated. Here we show two different ways of finding their typical trajectories. We make use of an intriguing connection to spin glasses: the expected free energy of the random energy model is an average of log-normal variates. We make the mapping to GBM explicit and find that the free energy result gives qualitatively correct behavior for GBM trajectories. We then also compute the typical sum of lognormal variates using Ito calculus.

{"title": "LGQ: Learning Discretization Geometry for Scalable and Stable Image Tokenization", "abstract": "Discrete image tokenization is a key bottleneck for scalable visual generation: a tokenizer must remain compact for efficient latent-space priors while preserving semantic structure and using discrete capacity effectively. Existing quantizers face a trade-off: vector-quantized tokenizers learn flexible geometries but often suffer from biased straight-through optimization, codebook under-utilization, and representation collapse at large vocabularies. Structured scalar or implicit tokenizers ensure stable, near-complete utilization by design, yet rely on fixed discretization geometries that may allocate capacity inefficiently under heterogeneous latent statistics. We introduce Learnable Geometric Quantization (LGQ), a discrete image tokenizer that learns discretization geometry end-to-end. LGQ replaces hard nearest-neighbor lookup with temperature-controlled soft assignments, enabling fully differentiable training while recovering hard assignments at inference. The assignments correspond to posterior responsibilities of an isotropic Gaussian mixture and minimize a variational free-energy objective, provably converging to nearest-neighbor quantization in the low-temperature limit. LGQ combines a token-level peakedness regularizer with a global usage regularizer to encourage confident yet balanced code utilization without imposing rigid grids. Under a controlled VQGAN-style backbone on ImageNet across multiple vocabulary sizes, LGQ achieves stable optimization and balanced utilization. At 16K codebook size, LGQ improves rFID by 11.88% over FSQ while using 49.96% fewer active codes, and improves rFID by 6.06% over SimVQ with 49.45% lower effective representation rate, achieving comparable fidelity with substantially fewer active entries.

{"title": "Metabolic cost of information processing in Poisson variational autoencoders", "abstract": "Computation in biological systems is fundamentally energy-constrained, yet standard theories of computation treat energy as freely available. Here, we argue that variational free energy minimization under a Poisson assumption offers a principled path toward an energy-aware theory of computation. Our key observation is that the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence term in the Poisson free energy objective becomes proportional to the prior firing rates of model neurons, yielding an emergent metabolic cost term that penalizes high baseline activity. This structure couples an abstract information-theoretic quantity -- the *coding rate* -- to a concrete biophysical variable -- the *firing rate* -- which enables a trade-off between coding fidelity and energy expenditure. Such a coupling arises naturally in the Poisson variational autoencoder (P-VAE) -- a brain-inspired generative model that encodes inputs as discrete spike counts and recovers a spiking form of *sparse coding* as a special case -- but is absent from standard Gaussian VAEs. To demonstrate that this metabolic cost structure is unique to the Poisson formulation, we compare the P-VAE against Grelu-VAE, a Gaussian VAE with ReLU rectification applied to latent samples, which controls for the non-negativity constraint. Across a systematic sweep of the KL term weighting coefficient $β$ and latent dimensionality, we find that increasing $β$ monotonically increases sparsity and reduces average spiking activity in the P-VAE. In contrast, Grelu-VAE representations remain unchanged, confirming that the effect is specific to Poisson statistics rather than a byproduct of non-negative representations. These results establish Poisson variational inference as a promising foundation for a resource-constrained theory of computation.", "authors": [{"name": "Hadi Vafaii", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Jacob L.

The variational inference (VI) is one of the most widely adopted approximate inference methods.

Although there have been quite a few score-based variational inference methods proposed in the community, most are not adequate for large-scale BNNs for various computational and technical reasons. We propose a novel scalable VI method where the learning objective combines the score matching loss and the proximal penalty term in iterations, which helps our method avoid the reparametrized sampling, and allows for noisy unbiased mini-batch scores through stochastic gradients. This in turn makes our method scalable to large-scale neural networks including Vision Transformers, and allows for richer variational density families.

{"title": "A Tensor-Structured Approach to Dynamic Channel Prediction for Massive MIMO Systems with Temporal Non-Stationarity", "abstract": "In moderate- to high-mobility scenarios, CSI varies rapidly and becomes temporally non-stationary, leading to severe performance degradation in the massive MIMO transmissions. To address this issue, we propose a tensor-structured approach to dynamic channel prediction (TS-DCP) for massive MIMO systems with temporal non-stationarity, exploiting both dual-timescale and cross-domain correlations. Specifically, due to inherent spatial consistency, non-stationary channels over long-timescales can be approximated as stationary on short-timescales, decoupling complicated temporal correlations into more tractable dual-timescale ones. To exploit such property, we propose the sliding frame structure composed of multiple pilot OFDM symbols, which capture short-timescale correlations within frames by Doppler domain modeling and long-timescale correlations across frames by Markov/autoregressive processes. Building on this, we develop the Tucker-based spatial-frequency-temporal domain channel model, incorporating angle-delay-Doppler (ADD) domain channels and factor matrices parameterized by ADD domain grids. Furthermore, we model cross-domain correlations of ADD domain channels within each frame, induced by clustered scattering, through the Markov random field and tensor-coupled Gaussian distribution that incorporates high-order neighboring structures. Following these probabilistic models, we formulate the TS-DCP problem as variational free energy (VFE) minimization, and unify different inference rules through the structure design of trial beliefs. This formulation results in the dual-layer VFE optimization process and yields the online TS-DCP algorithm, where the computational complexity is reduced by exploiting tensor-structured operations.

This is the essence of learning, as Bayesian updating. It will be illustrated via a physical model involving (adapted) water flows through pipes with different diameters. Bayesian updating makes us wiser, in the sense that the posterior distribution makes the evidence more likely than the prior, since it incorporates the evidence. Things are less clear when one wishes to learn from multiple pieces of evidence / data. It turns out that there are (at least) two forms of updating for this, associated with Jeffrey and Pearl. The difference is not always clearly recognised. This paper provides an introduction and an overview in the setting of discrete probability theory. It starts from an elementary question, involving multiple pieces of evidence, that has been sent to a small group academic specialists. Their answers show considerable differences. This is used as motivation and starting point to introduce the two forms of updating, of Jeffrey and Pearl, for multiple inputs and to elaborate their properties.

This work shows that the Hamiltonian of generic dynamical systems constitutes a class of generative models, thus rendering their Helmholtz energy equivalent to variational free energy under the identified generative model. The self-organisation that minimises the Helmholtz energy entails matching the system's Hamiltonian with that of the environment, leading to the ensuing emergence of their generalised synchrony. In essence, these self-organising systems can be read as performing variational Bayesian inference of their interacting environment. These properties have been demonstrated using coupled oscillators, simulated and living neural networks, and quantum computers.

Until now, Bayesian model reduction has been applied mainly in the computational neuroscience community on simple models. In this paper, we formulate and apply Bayesian model reduction to perform principled pruning of Bayesian neural networks, based on variational free energy minimization. Direct application of Bayesian model reduction, however, gives rise to approximation errors. Therefore, a novel iterative pruning algorithm is presented to alleviate the problems arising with naive Bayesian model reduction, as supported experimentally on the publicly available UCI datasets for different inference algorithms. This novel parameter pruning scheme solves the shortcomings of current state-of-the-art pruning methods that are used by the signal processing community.

The algorithm -- inspired by variational methods used in computational physics -- is iterative and can get easily stuck in local minima, even when classical techniques, such as deterministic annealing (DA), are used. We study a variational Bayes (VB) inference algorithm based on a non-traditional quantum annealing approach -- referred to as quantum annealing variational Bayes (QAVB) inference -- and show that there is indeed a quantum advantage to QAVB over its classical counterparts. In particular, we show that such better performance is rooted in key concepts from quantum mechanics: (i) the ground state of the Hamiltonian of a quantum system -- defined from the given variational Bayes (VB) problem -- corresponds to an optimal solution for the minimization problem of the variational free energy at very low temperatures; (ii) such a ground state can be achieved by a technique paralleling the quantum annealing process; and (iii) starting from this ground state, the optimal solution to the VB problem can be achieved by increasing the heat bath temperature to unity, and thereby avoiding local minima introduced by spontaneous symmetry breaking observed in classical physics based VB algorithms.

{"title": "Bayesian brains and the Rényi divergence", "abstract": "Under the Bayesian brain hypothesis, behavioural variations can be attributed to different priors over generative model parameters. This provides a formal explanation for why individuals exhibit inconsistent behavioural preferences when confronted with similar choices. For example, greedy preferences are a consequence of confident (or precise) beliefs over certain outcomes. Here, we offer an alternative account of behavioural variability using Rényi divergences and their associated variational bounds. Rényi bounds are analogous to the variational free energy (or evidence lower bound) and can be derived under the same assumptions. Importantly, these bounds provide a formal way to establish behavioural differences through an $α$ parameter, given fixed priors. This rests on changes in $α$ that alter the bound (on a continuous scale), inducing different posterior estimates and consequent variations in behaviour. Thus, it looks as if individuals have different priors, and have reached different conclusions. More specifically, $α\\to 0^{+}$ optimisation leads to mass-covering variational estimates and increased variability in choice behaviour. Furthermore, $α\\to + \\infty$ optimisation leads to mass-seeking variational posteriors and greedy preferences. We exemplify this formulation through simulations of the multi-armed bandit task. We note that these $α$ parameterisations may be especially relevant, i.e., shape preferences, when the true posterior is not in the same family of distributions as the assumed (simpler) approximate density, which may be the case in many real-world scenarios.

{"title": "Bayesian Population Receptive Field Modelling", "abstract": "We introduce a probabilistic (Bayesian) framework and associated software toolbox for mapping population receptive fields (pRFs) based on fMRI data. This generic approach is intended to work with stimuli of any dimension and is demonstrated and validated in the context of 2D retinotopic mapping. The framework enables the experimenter to specify generative (encoding) models of fMRI timeseries, in which experimental manipulations enter a pRF model of neural activity, which in turns drives a nonlinear model of neurovascular coupling and Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) response. The neuronal and haemodynamic parameters are estimated together on a voxel-by-voxel or region-of-interest basis using a Bayesian estimation algorithm (variational Laplace). This offers several novel contributions to receptive field modelling. The variance / covariance of parameters are estimated, enabling receptive fields to be plotted while properly representing uncertainty about pRF size and location. Variability in the haemodynamic response across the brain is accounted for. Furthermore, the framework introduces formal hypothesis testing to pRF analysis, enabling competing models to be evaluated based on their model evidence (approximated by the variational free energy), which represents the optimal tradeoff between accuracy and complexity. Using simulations and empirical data, we found that parameters typically used to represent pRF size and neuronal scaling are strongly correlated, which should be taken into account when making inferences. We used the framework to compare the evidence for six variants of pRF model using 7T functional MRI data and we found a circular Difference of Gaussians (DoG) model to be the best explanation for our data overall.

{"title": "Universal Darwinism As a Process of Bayesian Inference", "abstract": "Many of the mathematical frameworks describing natural selection are equivalent to Bayes' Theorem, also known as Bayesian updating. By definition, a process of Bayesian Inference is one which involves a Bayesian update, so we may conclude that these frameworks describe natural selection as a process of Bayesian inference. Thus, natural selection serves as a counter example to a widely-held interpretation that restricts Bayesian Inference to human mental processes (including the endeavors of statisticians). As Bayesian inference can always be cast in terms of (variational) free energy minimization, natural selection can be viewed as comprising two components: a generative model of an “experiment” in the external world environment, and the results of that “experiment” or the “surprise” entailed by predicted and actual outcomes of the “experiment.” Minimization of free energy implies that the implicit measure of “surprise” experienced serves to update the generative model in a Bayesian manner. This description closely accords with the mechanisms of generalized Darwinian process proposed both by Dawkins, in terms of replicators and vehicles, and Campbell, in terms of inferential systems. Bayesian inference is an algorithm for the accumulation of evidence-based knowledge. This algorithm is now seen to operate over a wide range of evolutionary processes, including natural selection, the evolution of mental models and cultural evolutionary processes, notably including science itself. The variational principle of free energy minimization may thus serve as a unifying mathematical framework for universal Darwinism, the study of evolutionary processes operating throughout nature.", "authors": [{"name": "John O.

{"title": "Simplifying Generalized Belief Propagation on Redundant Region Graphs", "abstract": "The cluster variation method has been developed into a general theoretical framework for treating short-range correlations in many-body systems after it was first proposed by Kikuchi in 1951. On the numerical side, a message-passing approach called generalized belief propagation (GBP) was proposed by Yedidia, Freeman and Weiss about a decade ago as a way of computing the minimal value of the cluster variational free energy and the marginal distributions of clusters of variables. However the GBP equations are often redundant, and it is quite a non-trivial task to make the GBP iteration converges to a fixed point. These drawbacks hinder the application of the GBP approach to finite-dimensional frustrated and disordered systems. In this work we report an alternative and simple derivation of the GBP equations starting from the partition function expression. Based on this derivation we propose a natural and systematic way of removing the redundance of the GBP equations. We apply the simplified generalized belief propagation (SGBP) equations to the two-dimensional and the three-dimensional ferromagnetic Ising model and Edwards-Anderson spin glass model. The numerical results confirm that the SGBP message-passing approach is able to achieve satisfactory performance on these model systems. We also suggest that a subset of the SGBP equations can be neglected in the numerical iteration process without affecting the final results.", "authors": [{"name": "Chuang Wang", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Hai-Jun Zhou", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2013, "doi": "10.1088/1742-6596/473/1/012004", "arxiv_id": "1304.5112", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2013-04-18"}

{"title": "A Variational Inference Framework for Soft-In-Soft-Out Detection in Multiple Access Channels", "abstract": "We propose a unified framework for deriving and studying soft-in-soft-out (SISO) detection in interference channels using the concept of variational inference. The proposed framework may be used in multiple-access interference (MAI), inter-symbol interference (ISI), and multiple-input multiple-outpu (MIMO) channels. Without loss of generality, we will focus our attention on turbo multiuser detection, to facilitate a more concrete discussion. It is shown that, with some loss of optimality, variational inference avoids the exponential complexity of a posteriori probability (APP) detection by optimizing a closely-related, but much more manageable, objective function called variational free energy. In addition to its systematic appeal, there are several other advantages to this viewpoint. First of all, it provides unified and rigorous justifications for numerous detectors that were proposed on radically different grounds, and facilitates convenient joint detection and decoding (utilizing the turbo principle) when error-control codes are incorporated. Secondly, efficient joint parameter estimation and data detection is possible via the variational expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, such that the detrimental effect of inaccurate channel knowledge at the receiver may be dealt with systematically. We are also able to extend BPSK-based SISO detection schemes to arbitrary square QAM constellations in a rigorous manner using a variational argument.", "authors": [{"name": "D. D.

{"title": "Cluster Variation Method in Statistical Physics and Probabilistic Graphical Models", "abstract": "The cluster variation method (CVM) is a hierarchy of approximate variational techniques for discrete (Ising--like) models in equilibrium statistical mechanics, improving on the mean--field approximation and the Bethe--Peierls approximation, which can be regarded as the lowest level of the CVM. In recent years it has been applied both in statistical physics and to inference and optimization problems formulated in terms of probabilistic graphical models. The foundations of the CVM are briefly reviewed, and the relations with similar techniques are discussed. The main properties of the method are considered, with emphasis on its exactness for particular models and on its asymptotic properties. The problem of the minimization of the variational free energy, which arises in the CVM, is also addressed, and recent results about both provably convergent and message-passing algorithms are discussed.", "authors": [{"name": "Alessandro Pelizzola", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2005, "doi": "10.1088/0305-4470/38/33/R01", "arxiv_id": "cond-mat/0508216", "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": "2005-08-09"}
{"title": "The Markov blankets of life: autonomy, active inference and the free energy principle", "abstract": "This work addresses the autonomous organization of biological systems. It does so by considering the boundaries of biological systems, from individual cells to Home sapiens , in terms of the presence of Markov blankets under the active inference scheme—a corollary of the free energy principle. A Markov blanket defines the boundaries of a system in a statistical sense. Here we consider how a collective of Markov blankets can self-assemble into a global system that itself has a Markov blanket; thereby providing an illustration of how autonomous systems can be understood as having layers of nested and self-sustaining boundaries. This allows us to show that: (i) any living system is a Markov blanketed system and (ii) the boundaries of such systems need not be co-extensive with the biophysical boundaries of a living organism. In other words, autonomous systems are hierarchically composed of Markov blankets of Markov blankets—all the way down to individual cells, all the way up to you and me, and all the way out to include elements of the local environment.", "authors": [{"name": "Michael D.

{"title": "An Integrated World Modeling Theory (IWMT) of Consciousness: Combining Integrated Information and Global Neuronal Workspace Theories With the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference Framework; Toward Solving the Hard Problem and Characterizing Agentic Causation", "abstract": "The Free Energy Principle and Active Inference Framework (FEP-AI) begins with the understanding that persisting systems must regulate environmental exchanges and prevent entropic accumulation. In FEP-AI, minds and brains are predictive controllers for autonomous systems, where action-driven perception is realized as probabilistic inference. Integrated Information Theory (IIT) begins with considering the preconditions for a system to intrinsically exist, as well as axioms regarding the nature of consciousness. IIT has produced controversy because of its surprising entailments: quasi-panpsychism; subjectivity without referents or dynamics; and the possibility of fully-intelligent-yet-unconscious brain simulations. Here, I describe how these controversies might be resolved by integrating IIT with FEP-AI, where integrated information only entails consciousness for systems with perspectival reference frames capable of generating models with spatial, temporal, and causal coherence for self and world. Without that connection with external reality, systems could have arbitrarily high amounts of integrated information, but nonetheless would not entail subjective experience. I further describe how an integration of these frameworks may contribute to their evolution as unified systems theories and models of emergent causation. Then, inspired by both Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT) and the Harmonic Brain Modes framework, I describe how streams of consciousness may emerge as an evolving generation of sensorimotor predictions, with the precise composition of experiences depending on the integration abilities of synchronous complexes as self-organizing harmonic modes (SOHMs). These integrating dynamics may be particularly likely to occur via richly connected subnetworks affording body-centric sources of phenomenal binding and executive control. Along these connectivity backbones, SOHMs are proposed to implement turbo coding via loopy message-passing over predictive (autoencoding) networks, thus generating maximum a posteriori estimates as coherent vectors governing neural evolution, with alpha frequencies generating basic awareness, and cross-frequency phase-coupling within theta frequencies for access consciousness and volitional control. These dynamic cores of integrated information also function as global workspaces, centered on posterior cortices, but capable of being entrained with frontal cortices and interoceptive hierarchies, thus affording agentic causation. Integrated World Modeling Theory (IWMT) represents a synthetic approach to understanding minds that reveals compatibility between leading theories of consciousness, thus enabling inferential

{"title": "Active Inference: A Process Theory", "abstract": "This article describes a process theory based on active inference and belief propagation. Starting from the premise that all neuronal processing (and action selection) can be explained by maximizing Bayesian model evidence—or minimizing variational free energy—we ask whether neuronal responses can be described as a gradient descent on variational free energy. Using a standard (Markov decision process) generative model, we derive the neuronal dynamics implicit in this description and reproduce a remarkable range of well-characterized neuronal phenomena. These include repetition suppression, mismatch negativity, violation responses, place-cell activity, phase precession, theta sequences, theta-gamma coupling, evidence accumulation, race-to-bound dynamics, and transfer of dopamine responses. Furthermore, the (approximately Bayes’ optimal) behavior prescribed by these dynamics has a degree of face validity, providing a formal explanation for reward seeking, context learning, and epistemic foraging. Technically, the fact that a gradient descent appears to be a valid description of neuronal activity means that variational free energy is a Lyapunov function for neuronal dynamics, which therefore conform to Hamilton’s principle of least action.", "authors": [{"name": "Karl Friston", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0001-7984-8909"}, {"name": "Thomas H.

{"title": "Active Inference", "abstract": "The first comprehensive treatment of active inference, an integrative perspective on brain, cognition, and behavior used across multiple disciplines. Active inference is a way of understanding sentient behavior—a theory that characterizes perception, planning, and action in terms of probabilistic inference. Developed by theoretical neuroscientist Karl Friston over years of groundbreaking research, active inference provides an integrated perspective on brain, cognition, and behavior that is increasingly used across multiple disciplines including neuroscience, psychology, and philosophy. Active inference puts the action into perception. This book offers the first comprehensive treatment of active inference, covering theory, applications, and cognitive domains. Active inference is a “first principles” approach to understanding behavior and the brain, framed in terms of a single imperative to minimize free energy. The book emphasizes the implications of the free energy principle for understanding how the brain works. It first introduces active inference both conceptually and formally, contextualizing it within current theories of cognition. It then provides specific examples of computational models that use active inference to explain such cognitive phenomena as perception, attention, memory, and planning.", "authors": [{"name": "Thomas Parr", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0001-5108-5743"}, {"name": "Giovanni Pezzulo", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0001-6813-8282"}, {"name": "Karl Friston", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0001-7984-8909"}], "year": 2022, "doi": "10.7551/mitpress/12441.001.0001", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W4226400653", "venue": "The MIT Press eBooks", "citation_count": 472, "references": [], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Integrated World Modeling Theory (IWMT) Implemented: Towards Reverse Engineering Consciousness with the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference", "abstract": "Integrated World Modeling Theory (IWMT) is a synthetic model that attempts to unify theories of consciousness within the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference framework, with particular emphasis on Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT). IWMT further suggests predictive processing in sensory hierarchies may be well-modeled as (folded, sparse, partially disentangled) variational autoencoders, with beliefs discretely-updated via the formation of synchronous complexes—as self-organizing harmonic modes (SOHMs)—potentially entailing maximal a posteriori (MAP) estimation via turbo coding. In this account, alpha-synchronized SOHMs across posterior cortices may constitute the kinds of maximal complexes described by IIT, as well as samples (or MAP estimates) from multimodal shared latent space, organized according to egocentric reference frames, entailing phenomenal consciousness as mid-level perceptual inference. When these posterior SOHMs couple with frontal complexes, this may enable various forms of conscious access as a kind of mental act(ive inference), affording higher order cognition/control, including the kinds of attentional/intentional processing and reportability described by GNWT. Across this autoencoding heterarchy, intermediate-level beliefs may be organized into spatiotemporal trajectories by the entorhinal/hippocampal system, so affording episodic memory, counterfactual imaginings, and planning.", "authors": [{"name": "Adam Safron", "affiliation": "Indiana University Bloomington", "orcid": "0000-0002-3102-7623"}], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.31234/osf.io/paz5j", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W4239633104", "venue": null, "citation_count": 14, "references": ["openalex:W1509953508", "openalex:W1524895715", "openalex:W1549639195", "openalex:W1902335101", "openalex:W1959608418", "openalex:W1978389345", "openalex:W1989672532", "openalex:W1991362484", "openalex:W2047407444", "openalex:W2048701323", "openalex:W2066771173", "openalex:W2086815053", "openalex:W2095705004", "openalex:W2100015356", "openalex:W2114766444", "openalex:W2116386744", "openalex:W2119885245", "openalex:W2120079537", "openalex:W2121606987", "openalex:W2123213117", "openalex:W2129031807", "openalex:W2148764920", "openalex:W2155051738", "openalex:W2159210250", "openalex:W2165106227", "openalex:W2248869969", "openalex:W2259576239", "openalex:W2326588846", "openalex:W2394834952", "openalex:W2514120153", "openalex:W2537240939", "openalex:W2552810632", "openalex:W2577983519", "openalex:W2586591890", "openalex:W2612300711", "openalex:W2620332686", "openalex:W2751258126", "openalex:W2751471435", "openalex:W2775143585", "openalex:W2781668895", "openalex:W2785331752", "openalex:W2789062658", "openalex:W2792526813", "openalex:W2794561120", "openalex:W2805516822", "openalex:W2814803617", "openalex:W2888840253", "openalex:W2890840786", "openalex:W2893325263", "openalex:W2905334783", "openalex:W2911637930", "openalex:W2912908978", "openalex:W2918957485", "openalex:W2922783569", "openalex:W2945067895", "openalex:W2949369413", "openalex:W2951595529", "openalex:W2952447148", "openalex:W2952687353", "openalex:W2953201006", "openalex:W2954216039", "openalex:W2956607501", "openalex:W2956728914", "openalex:W2960216878", "openalex:W2962681511", "openalex:W2964167449", "openalex:W2965098480", "openalex:W2970982053", "openalex:W2972967522", "openalex:W2980587554", "openalex:W2988523110", "openalex:W2989880046", "openalex:W2990775060", "openalex:W2996546981", "openalex:W2997574889", "openalex:W2999778183", "openalex:W3002974041", "openalex:W3005155573", "openalex:W3005621022", "openalex:W3006412608", "openalex:W3009555114", "openalex:W3014178136", "openalex:W3014227508", "openalex:W3015680038", "openalex:W3016391357", "openalex:W3023671316", "openalex:W3035420228", "openalex:W3036548566", "openalex:W3043137967", "openalex:W3046452378", "openalex:W3048465007", "openalex:W3048948412", "openalex:W3071138943", "openalex:W3104162526", "openalex:W3104525895", "openalex:W3123185716", "openalex:W3132064850", "openalex:W3152893301", "openalex:W3164665868", "openalex:W3210699874", "openalex:W3212378668", "openalex:W4230608319", "openalex:W4237718205", "openalex:W4240023801", "openalex:W4240402997", "openalex:W4243180883", "openalex:W4287812714", "openalex:W4288325991", "openalex:W4300246344", "openalex:W4394656990"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Active inference and epistemic value", "abstract": "We offer a formal treatment of choice behavior based on the premise that agents minimize the expected free energy of future outcomes. Crucially, the negative free energy or quality of a policy can be decomposed into extrinsic and epistemic (or intrinsic) value. Minimizing expected free energy is therefore equivalent to maximizing extrinsic value or expected utility (defined in terms of prior preferences or goals), while maximizing information gain or intrinsic value (or reducing uncertainty about the causes of valuable outcomes). The resulting scheme resolves the exploration-exploitation dilemma: Epistemic value is maximized until there is no further information gain, after which exploitation is assured through maximization of extrinsic value. This is formally consistent with the Infomax principle, generalizing formulations of active vision based upon salience (Bayesian surprise) and optimal decisions based on expected utility and risk-sensitive (Kullback-Leibler) control. Furthermore, as with previous active inference formulations of discrete (Markovian) problems, ad hoc softmax parameters become the expected (Bayes-optimal) precision of beliefs about, or confidence in, policies. This article focuses on the basic theory, illustrating the ideas with simulations.

{"title": "Reinforcement Learning or Active Inference?", "abstract": "This paper questions the need for reinforcement learning or control theory when optimising behaviour. We show that it is fairly simple to teach an agent complicated and adaptive behaviours using a free-energy formulation of perception. In this formulation, agents adjust their internal states and sampling of the environment to minimize their free-energy. Such agents learn causal structure in the environment and sample it in an adaptive and self-supervised fashion. This results in behavioural policies that reproduce those optimised by reinforcement learning and dynamic programming. Critically, we do not need to invoke the notion of reward, value or utility. We illustrate these points by solving a benchmark problem in dynamic programming; namely the mountain-car problem, using active perception or inference under the free-energy principle. The ensuing proof-of-concept may be important because the free-energy formulation furnishes a unified account of both action and perception and may speak to a reappraisal of the role of dopamine in the brain.", "authors": [{"name": "Karl Friston", "affiliation": "University College London", "orcid": "0000-0001-7984-8909"}, {"name": "Jean Daunizeau", "affiliation": "University College London", "orcid": "0000-0001-9142-1270"}, {"name": "Stefan J.

{"title": "The police hunch: the Bayesian brain, active inference, and the free energy principle in action", "abstract": "In the realm of law enforcement, the “police hunch” has long been a mysterious but crucial aspect of decision-making. Drawing on the developing framework of Active Inference from cognitive science, this theoretical article examines the genesis, mechanics, and implications of the police hunch. It argues that hunches – often vital in high-stakes situations – should not be described as mere intuitions, but as intricate products of our mind’s generative models. These models, shaped by observations of the social world and assimilated and enacted through active inference, seek to reduce surprise and make hunches an indispensable tool for officers, in exactly the same way that hypotheses are indispensable for scientists. However, the predictive validity of hunches is influenced by a range of factors, including experience and bias, thus warranting critical examination of their reliability. This article not only explores the formation of police hunches but also provides practical insights for officers and researchers on how to harness the power of active inference to fully understand policing decisions and subsequently explore new avenues for future research.", "authors": [{"name": "Gareth Stubbs", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0002-7631-2823"}, {"name": "Karl Friston", "affiliation": "University College London", "orcid": "0000-0001-7984-8909"}], "year": 2024, "doi": "10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1368265", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W4392515830", "venue": "Frontiers in Psychology", "citation_count": 4, "references": ["openalex:W109845194", "openalex:W131493662", "openalex:W163181514", "openalex:W1071562686", "openalex:W1418557530", "openalex:W1524895715", "openalex:W1620203002", "openalex:W1929834889", "openalex:W1988520084", "openalex:W1996282969", "openalex:W1999235597", "openalex:W2005347883", "openalex:W2009315052", "openalex:W2017392705", "openalex:W2050390135", "openalex:W2052320224", "openalex:W2052685640", "openalex:W2069951541", "openalex:W2073733705", "openalex:W2076580309", "openalex:W2078474764", "openalex:W2083806321", "openalex:W2088277324", "openalex:W2088595143", "openalex:W2091566893", "openalex:W2095278873", "openalex:W2111947800", "openalex:W2115979064", "openalex:W2122458046", "openalex:W2130195834", "openalex:W2132003317", "openalex:W2147565549", "openalex:W2148544865", "openalex:W2148764920", "openalex:W2156358825", "openalex:W2463330366", "openalex:W2530226740", "openalex:W2531083186", "openalex:W2568418580", "openalex:W2606006569", "openalex:W2606069935", "openalex:W2609141456", "openalex:W2678181971", "openalex:W2751749598", "openalex:W2771975435", "openalex:W2797051230", "openalex:W2802947734", "openalex:W2804968036", "openalex:W2886956600", "openalex:W2889373600", "openalex:W2933899145", "openalex:W2947609478", "openalex:W2952112843", "openalex:W3012959192", "openalex:W3031979903", "openalex:W3162663886", "openalex:W3184661562", "openalex:W4200551561", "openalex:W4206924735", "openalex:W4224236192", "openalex:W4226400653", "openalex:W4232286724", "openalex:W4237315766", "openalex:W4237674828", "openalex:W4238051713", "openalex:W4249258521", "openalex:W4281401161", "openalex:W4310746673", "openalex:W4316036190", "openalex:W4365515296", "openalex:W4384281905", "openalex:W4385954291", "openalex:W4386819758", "openalex:W6658624169", "openalex:W6682671827", "openalex:W6736156619", "openalex:W6739563408", "openalex:W6764656272", "openalex:W6811252332", "openalex:W6839035660", "openalex:W6847230206"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Minimal self-models and the free energy principle", "abstract": "The term “minimal phenomenal selfhood” (MPS) describes the basic, pre- reflective experience of being a self (Blanke and Metzinger, 2009). Theoretical accounts of the minimal self have long recognized the importance and the ambivalence of the body as both part of the physical world, and the enabling condition for being in this world (Gallagher, 2005a; Grafton, 2009). A recent account of MPS (Metzinger, 2004a) centers on the consideration that minimal selfhood emerges as the result of basic self-modeling mechanisms, thereby being founded on pre-reflective bodily processes. The free energy principle (FEP; Friston, 2010) is a novel unified theory of cortical function built upon the imperative that self-organizing systems entail hierarchical generative models of the causes of their sensory input, which are optimized by minimizing free energy as an approximation of the log-likelihood of the model. The implementation of the FEP via predictive coding mechanisms and in particular the active inference principle emphasizes the role of embodiment for predictive self-modeling, which has been appreciated in recent publications. In this review, we provide an overview of these conceptions and illustrate thereby the potential power of the FEP in explaining the mechanisms underlying minimal selfhood and its key constituents, multisensory integration, interoception, agency, perspective, and the experience of mineness. We conclude that the conceptualization of MPS can be well mapped onto a hierarchical generative model furnished by the FEP and may constitute the basis for higher-level, cognitive forms of self-referral, as well as the understanding of other minds.", "authors": [{"name": "Jakub Limanowski", "affiliation": "Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin", "orcid": "0000-0001-9673-5500"}, {"name": "Felix Blankenburg", "affiliation": "Freie Universität Berlin", "orcid": null}], "year": 2013, "doi": "10.3389/fnhum.2013.00547", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W2148544865", "venue": "Frontiers in Human Neuroscience", "citation_count": 275, "references": ["openalex:W49499802", "openalex:W1277353702", "openalex:W1494456132", "openalex:W1502378244", "openalex:W1507573241", "openalex:W1577335042", "openalex:W1580236838", "openalex:W1580568969", "openalex:W1608940843", "openalex:W1950864686", "openalex:W1963949534", "openalex:W1964648551", "openalex:W1964761116", "openalex:W1967003847", "openalex:W1967826667", "openalex:W1969139884", "openalex:W1971404739", "openalex:W1972242725", "openalex:W1972713878", "openalex:W1972961786", "openalex:W1977628053", "openalex:W1979311208", "openalex:W1979930175", "openalex:W1981698940", "openalex:W1984383922", "openalex:W1984675555", "openalex:W1989308633", "openalex:W1991362484", "openalex:W1994259251", "openalex:W1994892978", "openalex:W1995296289", "openalex:W1996992760", "openalex:W1998575772", "openalex:W2001292537", "openalex:W2008213467", "openalex:W2009794136", "openalex:W2011459890", "openalex:W2017142040", "openalex:W2017424427", "openalex:W2017522310", "openalex:W2022169873", "openalex:W2023043173", "openalex:W2025575849", "openalex:W2032250656", "openalex:W2033613103", "openalex:W2037141354", "openalex:W2039306175", "openalex:W2040471739", "openalex:W2040737786", "openalex:W2041769154", "openalex:W2044032680", "openalex:W2044508350", "openalex:W2049107249", "openalex:W2049166294", "openalex:W2051060617", "openalex:W2053155900", "openalex:W2053841739", "openalex:W2055789905", "openalex:W2056448794", "openalex:W2059705785", "openalex:W2060992353", "openalex:W2061131717", "openalex:W2061340574", "openalex:W2070461647", "openalex:W2077733326", "openalex:W2078088844", "openalex:W2078653473", "openalex:W2079763587", "openalex:W2080156516", "openalex:W2095087224", "openalex:W2095398263", "openalex:W2095596789", "openalex:W2095648136", "openalex:W2096375888", "openalex:W2101744684", "openalex:W2103176783", "openalex:W2104977601", "openalex:W2105558714", "openalex:W2106360908", "openalex:W2106775387", "openalex:W2106980598", "openalex:W2108340315", "openalex:W2108605629", "openalex:W2109378968", "openalex:W2111947800", "openalex:W2112560726", "openalex:W2116146623", "openalex:W2116533103", "openalex:W2119885245", "openalex:W2120079537", "openalex:W2120475259", "openalex:W2123856966", "openalex:W2126233790", "openalex:W2127770168", "openalex:W2127958135", "openalex:W2128666650", "openalex:W2132960888", "openalex:W2137194669", "openalex:W2139749000", "openalex:W2140916178", "openalex:W2142672241", "openalex:W2144908831", "openalex:W2145945667", "openalex:W2146576217", "openalex:W2147008239", "openalex:W2147093380", "openalex:W2148722741", "openalex:W2148764920", "openalex:W2148970177", "openalex:W2150266668", "openalex:W2150667231", "openalex:W2150931036", "openalex:W2151496011", "openalex:W2151582777", "openalex:W2153480757", "openalex:W2153791616", "openalex:W2154634136", "openalex:W2157376352", "openalex:W2160195521", "openalex:W2163530817", "openalex:W2163686172", "openalex:W2170100837", "openalex:W2171627550", "openalex:W2180885911", "openalex:W2287100580", "openalex:W2401848349", "openalex:W2483978650", "openalex:W2571600439", "openalex:W2587573685", "openalex:W2591458607", "openalex:W2751379301", "openalex:W3022532439", "openalex:W3128374220", "openalex:W3171389120", "openalex:W4230700920", "openalex:W4232948727", "openalex:W4237718205", "openalex:W4242455153", "openalex:W4249609777", "openalex:W4255049371", "openalex:W4288400169", "openalex:W4293115660", "openalex:W4299563156", "openalex:W4392145873", "openalex:W6609605167", "openalex:W6629455236", "openalex:W6629995486", "openalex:W6634616096", "openalex:W6682058393", "openalex:W6696596962", "openalex:W6713131112", "openalex:W6733251995", "openalex:W6733985108", "openalex:W6743412012", "openalex:W6959429459"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "A tale of two densities: active inference is enactive inference", "abstract": "The aim of this article is to clarify how best to interpret some of the central constructs that underwrite the free-energy principle (FEP) – and its corollary, active inference – in theoretical neuroscience and biology: namely, the role that generative models and variational densities play in this theory. We argue that these constructs have been systematically misrepresented in the literature, because of the conflation between the FEP and active inference, on the one hand, and distinct (albeit closely related) Bayesian formulations, centred on the brain – variously known as predictive processing, predictive coding or the prediction error minimisation framework. More specifically, we examine two contrasting interpretations of these models: a structural representationalist interpretation and an enactive interpretation. We argue that the structural representationalist interpretation of generative and recognition models does not do justice to the role that these constructs play in active inference under the FEP. We propose an enactive interpretation of active inference – what might be called enactive inference. In active inference under the FEP, the generative and recognition models are best cast as realising inference and control – the self-organising, belief-guided selection of action policies – and do not have the properties ascribed by structural representationalists.", "authors": [{"name": "Maxwell J.

{"title": "Exploration, novelty, surprise, and free energy minimization", "abstract": "This paper reviews recent developments under the free energy principle that introduce a normative perspective on classical economic (utilitarian) decision-making based on (active) Bayesian inference. It has been suggested that the free energy principle precludes novelty and complexity, because it assumes that biological systems-like ourselves-try to minimize the long-term average of surprise to maintain their homeostasis. However, recent formulations show that minimizing surprise leads naturally to concepts such as exploration and novelty bonuses. In this approach, agents infer a policy that minimizes surprise by minimizing the difference (or relative entropy) between likely and desired outcomes, which involves both pursuing the goal-state that has the highest expected utility (often termed \"exploitation\") and visiting a number of different goal-states (\"exploration\"). Crucially, the opportunity to visit new states increases the value of the current state. Casting decision-making problems within a variational framework, therefore, predicts that our behavior is governed by both the entropy and expected utility of future states. This dissolves any dialectic between minimizing surprise and exploration or novelty seeking.", "authors": [{"name": "Philipp Schwartenbeck", "affiliation": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging", "orcid": "0000-0001-8943-9965"}, {"name": "Thomas H.

{"title": "A Psychovisual Quality Metric in Free-Energy Principle", "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new psychovisual quality metric of images based on recent developments in brain theory and neuroscience, particularly the free-energy principle. The perception and understanding of an image is modeled as an active inference process, in which the brain tries to explain the scene using an internal generative model. The psychovisual quality is thus closely related to how accurately visual sensory data can be explained by the generative model, and the upper bound of the discrepancy between the image signal and its best internal description is given by the free energy of the cognition process. Therefore, the perceptual quality of an image can be quantified using the free energy. Constructively, we develop a reduced-reference free-energy-based distortion metric (FEDM) and a no-reference free-energy-based quality metric (NFEQM). The FEDM and the NFEQM are nearly invariant to many global systematic deviations in geometry and illumination that hardly affect visual quality, for which existing image quality metrics wrongly predict severe quality degradation. Although with very limited or even without information on the reference image, the FEDM and the NFEQM are highly competitive compared with the full-reference SSIM image quality metric on images in the popular LIVE database.

{"title": "What is mood? A computational perspective", "abstract": "Abstract The neurobiological understanding of mood, and by extension mood disorders, remains elusive despite decades of research implicating several neuromodulator systems. This review considers a new approach based on existing theories of functional brain organisation. The free energy principle (a.k.a. active inference), and its instantiation in the Bayesian brain, offers a complete and simple formulation of mood. It has been proposed that emotions reflect the precision of – or certainty about – the predicted sensorimotor/interoceptive consequences of action. By extending this reasoning, in a hierarchical setting, we suggest mood states act as (hyper) priors over uncertainty (i.e. emotions). Here, we consider the same computational pathology in the proprioceptive and interoceptive (behavioural and autonomic) domain in order to furnish an explanation for mood disorders. This formulation reconciles several strands of research at multiple levels of enquiry.", "authors": [{"name": "James E.

{"title": "The Cybernetic Bayesian Brain", "abstract": "Is there a single principle by which neural operations can account for perception, cognition, action, and even consciousness? A strong candidate is now taking shape in the form of “predictive processing”. On this theory, brains engage in predictive inference on the causes of sensory inputs by continuous minimization of prediction errors or informational “free energy”. Predictive processing can account, supposedly, not only for perception, but also for action and for the essential contribution of the body and environment in structuring sensorimotor interactions. In this paper I draw together some recent developments within predictive processing that involve predictive modelling of internal physiological states (interoceptive inference), and integration with “enactive” and “embodied” approaches to cognitive science (predictive perception of sensorimotor contingencies). The upshot is a development of predictive processing that originates, not in Helmholtzian perception-as-inference, but rather in 20th-century cybernetic principles that emphasized homeostasis and predictive control. This way of thinking leads to (i) a new view of emotion as active interoceptive inference; (ii) a common predictive framework linking experiences of body ownership, emotion, and exteroceptive perception; (iii) distinct interpretations of active inference as involving disruptive and disambiguatory—not just confirmatory—actions to test perceptual hypotheses; (iv) a neurocognitive operationalization of the “mastery of sensorimotor contingencies” (where sensorimotor contingencies reflect the rules governing sensory changes produced by various actions); and (v) an account of the sense of subjective reality of perceptual contents (“perceptual presence”) in terms of the extent to which predictive models encode potential sensorimotor relations (this being “counterfactual richness”). This is rich and varied territory, and surveying its landmarks emphasizes the need for experimental tests of its key contributions.", "authors": [{"name": "Anil K.

{"title": "Predicting green: really radical (plant) predictive processing", "abstract": "In this article we account for the way plants respond to salient features of their environment under the free-energy principle for biological systems. Biological self-organization amounts to the minimization of surprise over time. We posit that any self-organizing system must embody a generative model whose predictions ensure that (expected) free energy is minimized through action. Plants respond in a fast, and yet coordinated manner, to environmental contingencies. They pro-actively sample their local environment to elicit information with an adaptive value. Our main thesis is that plant behaviour takes place by way of a process (active inference) that predicts the environmental sources of sensory stimulation. This principle, we argue, endows plants with a form of perception that underwrites purposeful, anticipatory behaviour. The aim of the article is to assess the prospects of a radical predictive processing story that would follow naturally from the free-energy principle for biological systems; an approach that may ultimately bear upon our understanding of life and cognition more broadly.", "authors": [{"name": "Paco Calvo", "affiliation": "Universidad de Murcia", "orcid": "0000-0002-6196-7560"}, {"name": "Karl Friston", "affiliation": "National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery", "orcid": "0000-0001-7984-8909"}], "year": 2017, "doi": "10.1098/rsif.2017.0096", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W2664609681", "venue": "Journal of The Royal Society Interface", "citation_count": 113, "references": ["openalex:W81409850", "openalex:W256776660", "openalex:W332268481", "openalex:W379488513", "openalex:W567258528", "openalex:W585228377", "openalex:W653081992", "openalex:W1524895715", "openalex:W1769347018", "openalex:W1904091956", "openalex:W1965630974", "openalex:W1973981788", "openalex:W1975268337", "openalex:W1979452977", "openalex:W1981905332", "openalex:W1985742657", "openalex:W1993900316", "openalex:W2020290788", "openalex:W2025148441", "openalex:W2026284346", "openalex:W2026799324", "openalex:W2030625477", "openalex:W2045317472", "openalex:W2046122648", "openalex:W2047608445", "openalex:W2050373104", "openalex:W2052568503", "openalex:W2055789905", "openalex:W2059156134", "openalex:W2059156212", "openalex:W2059320470", "openalex:W2063453660", "openalex:W2067127243", "openalex:W2087426415", "openalex:W2090248291", "openalex:W2095087224", "openalex:W2095202635", "openalex:W2101944335", "openalex:W2103489224", "openalex:W2105209710", "openalex:W2115052140", "openalex:W2119885245", "openalex:W2122249653", "openalex:W2122458046", "openalex:W2123832578", "openalex:W2124365954", "openalex:W2125682417", "openalex:W2127958135", "openalex:W2128666650", "openalex:W2132003317", "openalex:W2136440184", "openalex:W2139064489", "openalex:W2141359678", "openalex:W2147008239", "openalex:W2147336195", "openalex:W2148764920", "openalex:W2151254767", "openalex:W2157376352", "openalex:W2168283452", "openalex:W2171056452", "openalex:W2227972880", "openalex:W2261395643", "openalex:W2283030830", "openalex:W2293942407", "openalex:W2320983896", "openalex:W2329452519", "openalex:W2410837675", "openalex:W2486533162", "openalex:W2503270140", "openalex:W2505900825", "openalex:W2528204983", "openalex:W2559171350", "openalex:W2604729532", "openalex:W2606002576", "openalex:W2753014128", "openalex:W2767770412", "openalex:W2772695228", "openalex:W2801226628", "openalex:W2904954238", "openalex:W4211019471", "openalex:W4213348475", "openalex:W4229558676", "openalex:W4237718205", "openalex:W4241976975", "openalex:W4245728778", "openalex:W4247883378", "openalex:W4248121176", "openalex:W4248787962", "openalex:W4249210107", "openalex:W6655557675"], "publication_date": null}

{"title": "Sophisticated Inference", "abstract": "Active inference offers a first principle account of sentient behavior, from which special and important cases—for example, reinforcement learning, active learning, Bayes optimal inference, Bayes optimal design—can be derived. Active inference finesses the exploitation-exploration dilemma in relation to prior preferences by placing information gain on the same footing as reward or value. In brief, active inference replaces value functions with functionals of (Bayesian) beliefs, in the form of an expected (variational) free energy. In this letter, we consider a sophisticated kind of active inference using a recursive form of expected free energy. Sophistication describes the degree to which an agent has beliefs about beliefs. We consider agents with beliefs about the counterfactual consequences of action for states of affairs and beliefs about those latent states. In other words, we move from simply considering beliefs about “what would happen if I did that” to “what I would believe about what would happen if I did that.” The recursive form of the free energy functional effectively implements a deep tree search over actions and outcomes in the future. Crucially, this search is over sequences of belief states as opposed to states per se. We illustrate the competence of this scheme using numerical simulations of deep decision problems.", "authors": [{"name": "Karl J.

{"title": "A free energy principle for a particular physics", "abstract": "This monograph attempts a theory of every 'thing' that can be distinguished from other things in a statistical sense. The ensuing statistical independencies, mediated by Markov blankets, speak to a recursive composition of ensembles (of things) at increasingly higher spatiotemporal scales. This decomposition provides a description of small things; e.g., quantum mechanics - via the Schrodinger equation, ensembles of small things - via statistical mechanics and related fluctuation theorems, through to big things - via classical mechanics. These descriptions are complemented with a Bayesian mechanics for autonomous or active things. Although this work provides a formulation of every thing, its main contribution is to examine the implications of Markov blankets for self-organisation to nonequilibrium steady-state. In brief, we recover an information geometry and accompanying free energy principle that allows one to interpret the internal states of something as representing or making inferences about its external states. The ensuing Bayesian mechanics is compatible with quantum, statistical and classical mechanics and may offer a formal description of lifelike particles.", "authors": [{"name": "Karl Friston",

{"title": "The Emperor's New Markov Blankets", "abstract": "Abstract The free energy principle, an influential framework in computational neuroscience and theoretical neurobiology, starts from the assumption that living systems ensure adaptive exchanges with their environment by minimizing the objective function of variational free energy. Following this premise, it claims to deliver a promising integration of the life sciences. In recent work, Markov blankets, one of the central constructs of the free energy principle, have been applied to resolve debates central to philosophy (such as demarcating the boundaries of the mind). The aim of this paper is twofold. First, we trace the development of Markov blankets starting from their standard application in Bayesian networks, via variational inference, to their use in the literature on active inference. We then identify a persistent confusion in the literature between the formal use of Markov blankets as an epistemic tool for Bayesian inference, and their novel metaphysical use in the free energy framework to demarcate the physical boundary between an agent and its environment. Consequently, we propose to distinguish between “Pearl blankets” to refer to the original epistemic use of Markov blankets and “Friston blankets” to refer to the new metaphysical construct. Second, we use this distinction to critically assess claims resting on the application of Markov blankets to philosophical problems. We suggest that this literature would do well in differentiating between two different research programmes: “inference with a model” and “inference within a model.” Only the latter is capable of doing metaphysical work with Markov blankets, but requires additional philosophical premises and cannot be justified by an appeal to the success of the mathematical framework alone.", "authors": [{"name":

{"title": "Reduced-Reference Image Quality Assessment in Free-Energy Principle and Sparse Representation", "abstract": "The free-energy principle in recent studies of brain theory and neuroscience models the perception and understanding of the outside scene as an active inference process, in which the brain tries to account for the visual scene with an internal generative model. Specifically, with the internal generative model, the brain yields corresponding predictions for its encountered visual scenes. Then, the discrepancy between the visual input and its brain prediction should be closely related to the quality of perceptions. On the other hand, sparse representation has been evidenced to resemble the strategy of the primary visual cortex in the brain for representing natural images. With the strong neurobiological support for sparse representation, in this paper, we approximate the internal generative model with sparse representation and propose an image quality metric accordingly, which is named FSI (free-energy principle and sparse representation-based index for image quality assessment). In FSI, the reference and distorted images are, respectively, predicted by the sparse representation at first. Then, the difference between the entropies of the prediction discrepancies is defined to measure the image quality. Experimental results on four large-scale image databases confirm the effectiveness of the FSI and its superiority over representative image quality assessment methods. The FSI belongs to reduced-reference methods, and it only needs a single number from the reference image for quality estimation.", "authors": [{"name": "Yutao Liu", "affiliation": "Harbin Institute of Technology", "orcid": "0009-0009-8562-4026"}, {"name": "Guangtao Zhai", "affiliation": "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "orcid": "0000-0001-8165-9322"}, {"name": "Ke Gu", "affiliation": "Beijing University of Technology", "orcid": "0000-0001-5540-3235"}, {"name": "Xianming Liu", "affiliation": "Harbin Institute of Technology", "orcid": "0000-0002-8857-1785"}, {"name": "Debin Zhao", "affiliation": "Harbin Institute of Technology", "orcid": "0000-0003-3434-9967"}, {"name": "Wen Gao", "affiliation": "Peking University", "orcid": "0000-0001-8894-1806"}], "year": 2017, "doi": "10.1109/tmm.2017.2729020", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W2738692335", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Multimedia", "citation_count": 146, "references": ["openalex:W1490100156", "openalex:W1562683879", "openalex:W1591116419", "openalex:W1971014006", "openalex:W1971155098", "openalex:W1977725648", "openalex:W1982471090", "openalex:W1985560945", "openalex:W1986931325", "openalex:W1988649016", "openalex:W2005001434", "openalex:W2008066834", "openalex:W2009272644", "openalex:W2028349405", "openalex:W2034436892", "openalex:W2037243393", "openalex:W2037328649", "openalex:W2045737896", "openalex:W2046119925", "openalex:W2052245719", "openalex:W2057224480", "openalex:W2063360098", "openalex:W2078204800", "openalex:W2081682760", "openalex:W2102591820", "openalex:W2103997799", "openalex:W2105464873", "openalex:W2107476778", "openalex:W2108364340", "openalex:W2116724443", "openalex:W2121058967", "openalex:W2127271355", "openalex:W2129644086", "openalex:W2131676517", "openalex:W2133251102", "openalex:W2133665775", "openalex:W2135957164", "openalex:W2141983208", "openalex:W2142058898", "openalex:W2142731874", "openalex:W2142884912", "openalex:W2145889472", "openalex:W2152404931", "openalex:W2153663612", "openalex:W2158546915", "openalex:W2160547390", "openalex:W2162692770", "openalex:W2168023013", "openalex:W2182295979", "openalex:W2189165327", "openalex:W2320852756", "openalex:W2342905144", "openalex:W2508691887", "openalex:W2511866412", "openalex:W2533370895", "openalex:W2539781702", "openalex:W2545685597", "openalex:W2579658395", "openalex:W2594112328", "openalex:W2621054742", "openalex:W3004320394", "openalex:W3105198140", "openalex:W3182211633", "openalex:W4235713725", "openalex:W6629341600", "openalex:W6675423221", "openalex:W6680437723", "openalex:W6684791271", "openalex:W6687400851", "openalex:W6798736878"], "publication_date": null}

{"title": "The Active Inference Approach to Ecological Perception: General Information Dynamics for Natural and Artificial Embodied Cognition", "abstract": "The emerging neurocomputational vision of humans as embodied, ecologically embedded, social agents-who shape and are shaped by their environment-offers a golden opportunity to revisit and revise ideas about the physical and information-theoretic underpinnings of life, mind, and consciousness itself. In particular, the active inference framework (AIF) makes it possible to bridge connections from computational neuroscience and robotics/AI to ecological psychology and phenomenology, revealing common underpinnings and overcoming key limitations. AIF opposes the mechanistic to the reductive, while staying fully grounded in a naturalistic and information-theoretic foundation, using the principle of free energy minimization. The latter provides a theoretical basis for a unified treatment of particles, organisms, and interactive machines, spanning from the inorganic to organic, non-life to life, and natural to artificial agents. We provide a brief introduction to AIF, then explore its implications for evolutionary theory, ecological psychology, embodied phenomenology, and robotics/AI research.

{"title": "PID Control as a Process of Active Inference with Linear Generative Models", "abstract": "In the past few decades, probabilistic interpretations of brain functions have become widespread in cognitive science and neuroscience. In particular, the free energy principle and active inference are increasingly popular theories of cognitive functions that claim to offer a unified understanding of life and cognition within a general mathematical framework derived from information and control theory, and statistical mechanics. However, we argue that if the active inference proposal is to be taken as a general process theory for biological systems, it is necessary to understand how it relates to existing control theoretical approaches routinely used to study and explain biological systems. For example, recently, PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control has been shown to be implemented in simple molecular systems and is becoming a popular mechanistic explanation of behaviours such as chemotaxis in bacteria and amoebae, and robust adaptation in biochemical networks. In this work, we will show how PID controllers can fit a more general theory of life and cognition under the principle of (variational) free energy minimisation when using approximate linear generative models of the world. This more general interpretation also provides a new perspective on traditional problems of PID controllers such as parameter tuning as well as the need to balance performances and robustness conditions of a controller. Specifically, we then show how these problems can be understood in terms of the optimisation of the precisions (inverse variances) modulating different prediction errors in the free energy functional.", "authors": [{"name": "Manuel Baltieri", "affiliation": "University of Sussex", "orcid": "0000-0002-6086-4711"}, {"name": "Christopher L.

{"title": "Toward a Unified Sub-symbolic Computational Theory of Cognition", "abstract": "This paper proposes how various disciplinary theories of cognition may be combined into a unifying, sub-symbolic, computational theory of cognition. The following theories are considered for integration: psychological theories, including the theory of event coding, event segmentation theory, the theory of anticipatory behavioral control, and concept development; artificial intelligence and machine learning theories, including reinforcement learning and generative artificial neural networks; and theories from theoretical and computational neuroscience, including predictive coding and free energy-based inference. In the light of such a potential unification, it is discussed how abstract cognitive, conceptualized knowledge and understanding may be learned from actively gathered sensorimotor experiences. The unification rests on the free energy-based inference principle, which essentially implies that the brain builds a predictive, generative model of its environment. Neural activity-oriented inference causes the continuous adaptation of the currently active predictive encodings. Neural structure-oriented inference causes the longer term adaptation of the developing generative model as a whole. Finally, active inference strives for maintaining internal homeostasis, causing goal-directed motor behavior. To learn abstract, hierarchical encodings, however, it is proposed that free energy-based inference needs to be enhanced with structural priors, which bias cognitive development toward the formation of particular, behaviorally suitable encoding structures. As a result, it is hypothesized how abstract concepts can develop from, and thus how they are structured by and grounded in, sensorimotor experiences. Moreover, it is sketched-out how symbol-like thought can be generated by a temporarily active set of predictive encodings, which constitute a distributed neural attractor in the form of an interactive free-energy minimum. The activated, interactive network attractor essentially characterizes the semantics of a concept or a concept composition, such as an actual or imagined situation in our environment. Temporal successions of attractors then encode unfolding semantics, which may be generated by a behavioral or mental interaction with an actual or imagined situation in our environment. Implications, further predictions, possible verification, and falsifications, as well as potential enhancements into a fully spelled-out unified theory of cognition are discussed at the end of the paper.", "authors": [{"name": "Martin V.

{"title": "The feeling of grip: novelty, error dynamics, and the predictive brain", "abstract": "According to the free energy principle biological agents resist a tendency to disorder in their interactions with a dynamically changing environment by keeping themselves in sensory and physiological states that are expected given their embodiment and the niche they inhabit (Friston in Nat Rev Neurosci 11(2):127–138, 2010. doi:10.1038/nrn2787). Why would a biological agent that aims at minimising uncertainty in its encounters with the world ever be motivated to seek out novelty? Novelty for such an agent would arrive in the form of sensory and physiological states that are unexpected. Such an agent ought therefore to avoid novel and surprising interactions with the world one might think. Yet humans and many other animals find play and other forms of novelty-seeking and exploration hugely rewarding. How can this be understood in frameworks for studying the mind that emphasise prediction error minimisation? This problem has been taken up in recent research concerned with epistemic action—actions an agent engages in to reduce uncertainty. However that work leaves two questions unanswered, which it is the aim of our paper to address. First, no account has been given yet of why it should feel good to the agent to engage the world playfully and with curiosity. Second an appeal is made to precision-estimation to explain epistemic action, yet it remains unclear how precision-weighting works in action more generally, or active inference. We argue that an answer to both questions may lie in the bodily states of an agent that track the rate at which free energy is being reduced. The recent literature on the predictive brain has connected the valence of emotional experiences to the rate of change in the reduction of prediction error (Joffily and Coricelli in PLoS Comput Biol 9(6):e1003094, 2013. doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003094; Van de Cruys, in Metzinger and Wiese (eds) Philosophy and predictive processing, vol 24, MIND Group, Frankfurt am Main, 2017. doi:10.15502/9783958573253). In this literature valenced emotional experiences are hypothesised to be identical with changes in the rate at which prediction error is reduced. Experiences are negatively valenced when overall prediction error increases and are positively valenced when the sum of prediction errors decrease. We offer an ecological-enactive interpretation of the concept of valence and its connection to rate of change of prediction error. We show how rate of change should be understood in terms of embodied states of affordance-related action readiness. We then go on to apply this ecological-enactive account of error dynamics to provide an answer to the first question we have raised: It may explain why it should feel good to an agent to be curious and playful. Our ecological-enactive account also allows us to show how error dynamics may provide an answer to the second question we have raised regarding how precision-weighting works in active inference. An agent that is sensitive to rates of error reduction can tune precision on the fly. We show how this ability to tune precision on the go can allow agents to develop skills for adapting better and better to the unexpected, and search out opportunities for resolving uncertainty and progressing in its learning.", "authors": [{"name": "Julian Kiverstein", "affiliation": "University of Amsterdam", "orcid": "0000-0003-3428-8367"}, {"name": "Mark Miller", "affiliation": "University of Edinburgh", "orcid": "0000-0003-1783-889X"}, {"name": "Erik Rietveld", "affiliation": "University of Amsterdam", "orcid": "0000-0001-5197-142X"}], "year": 2017, "doi": "10.1007/s11229-017-1583-9", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W2765412958", "venue": "Synthese", "citation_count": 136, "references": ["openalex:W142157839", "openalex:W160127806", "openalex:W399482815", "openalex:W1456772534", "openalex:W1549066977", "openalex:W1556695557", "openalex:W1581549330", "openalex:W1729777349", "openalex:W1973845142", "openalex:W1977360267", "openalex:W1979732124", "openalex:W1989616852", "openalex:W2002907081", "openalex:W2004303440", "openalex:W2013830186", "openalex:W2014114527", "openalex:W2024462648", "openalex:W2026913377", "openalex:W2032077341", "openalex:W2033613103", "openalex:W2034806191", "openalex:W2040268087", "openalex:W2054875698", "openalex:W2055789905", "openalex:W2057256606", "openalex:W2059320470", "openalex:W2062194069", "openalex:W2091417852", "openalex:W2095648136", "openalex:W2101382642", "openalex:W2101524054", "openalex:W2104615036", "openalex:W2107561084", "openalex:W2115460576", "openalex:W2117726420", "openalex:W2119252679", "openalex:W2121863487", "openalex:W2123611655", "openalex:W2128918015", "openalex:W2132049331", "openalex:W2135869619", "openalex:W2146671902", "openalex:W2148764920", "openalex:W2153791616", "openalex:W2157376352", "openalex:W2160554939", "openalex:W2338194712", "openalex:W2343597701", "openalex:W2469614650", "openalex:W2534098824", "openalex:W2535505326", "openalex:W2552810632", "openalex:W2605929261", "openalex:W2606442355", "openalex:W2607092740", "openalex:W2940166189", "openalex:W3100995110", "openalex:W4214717370", "openalex:W4237408199", "openalex:W4251341133", "openalex:W4283834748", "openalex:W4285719527", "openalex:W6607842524", "openalex:W6647609105", "openalex:W6677916085", "openalex:W7053019303"], "publication_date": null}

One fundamental yet underexplored aspect of brain and body interactions is the link between the respiratory and the nervous systems.

Moreover, we present a perspective linking respiration to the free-energy principle. We frame volitional modulation of the breath as an active inference mechanism in which sensory evidence is recontextualized to alter interoceptive models. We further propose that respiration-entrained gamma oscillations may reflect the propagation of prediction errors from the sensory level up to cortical regions in order to alter higher level predictions.

{"title": "Learning Generative State Space Models for Active Inference", "abstract": "In this paper we investigate the active inference framework as a means to enable autonomous behavior in artificial agents. Active inference is a theoretical framework underpinning the way organisms act and observe in the real world. In active inference, agents act in order to minimize their so called free energy, or prediction error. Besides being biologically plausible, active inference has been shown to solve hard exploration problems in various simulated environments. However, these simulations typically require handcrafting a generative model for the agent. Therefore we propose to use recent advances in deep artificial neural networks to learn generative state space models from scratch, using only observation-action sequences. This way we are able to scale active inference to new and challenging problem domains, whilst still building on the theoretical backing of the free energy principle. We validate our approach on the mountain car problem to illustrate that our learnt models can indeed trade-off instrumental value and ambiguity. Furthermore, we show that generative models can also be learnt using high-dimensional pixel observations, both in the OpenAI Gym car racing environment and a real-world robotic navigation task. Finally we show that active inference based policies are an order of magnitude more sample efficient than Deep Q Networks on RL tasks.", "authors": [{"name": "Ozan Çatal", "affiliation": "Ghent University", "orcid": "0000-0002-0216-7918"}, {"name": "Samuel T.

{"title": "An Investigation of the Free Energy Principle for Emotion Recognition", "abstract": "This paper offers a prospectus of what might be achievable in the development of emotional recognition devices. It provides a conceptual overview of the free energy principle; including Markov blankets, active inference, and-in particular-a discussion of selfhood and theory of mind, followed by a brief explanation of how these concepts can explain both neural and cultural models of emotional inference. The underlying hypothesis is that emotion recognition and inference devices will evolve from state-of-the-art deep learning models into active inference schemes that go beyond marketing applications and become adjunct to psychiatric practice. Specifically, this paper proposes that a second wave of emotion recognition devices will be equipped with an emotional lexicon (or the ability to epistemically search for one), allowing the device to resolve uncertainty about emotional states by actively eliciting responses from the user and learning from these responses. Following this, a third wave of emotional devices will converge upon the user's generative model, resulting in the machine and human engaging in a reciprocal, prosocial emotional interaction, i.e., sharing a generative model of emotional states.", "authors": [{"name": "Daphne Demekas", "affiliation": "University College London", "orcid": "0000-0003-4974-9242"}, {"name": "Thomas Parr", "affiliation": "University College London", "orcid": "0000-0001-5108-5743"}, {"name": "Karl Friston", "affiliation": "University College London", "orcid": "0000-0001-7984-8909"}], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.3389/fncom.2020.00030", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W3019918398", "venue": "Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience", "citation_count": 42, "references": ["openalex:W836721912", "openalex:W1529997575", "openalex:W1584724822", "openalex:W1620203002", "openalex:W1955537554", "openalex:W1968001820", "openalex:W1968799970", "openalex:W1973845142", "openalex:W1978549608", "openalex:W1979732124", "openalex:W1982517234", "openalex:W1986402015", "openalex:W1997607338", "openalex:W2003900693", "openalex:W2004652753", "openalex:W2014114527", "openalex:W2024149692", "openalex:W2026799324", "openalex:W2037346037", "openalex:W2047347093", "openalex:W2052685640", "openalex:W2059320470", "openalex:W2064175235", "openalex:W2067681588", "openalex:W2073548258", "openalex:W2081402846", "openalex:W2084235460", "openalex:W2085754318", "openalex:W2091867346", "openalex:W2096073681", "openalex:W2096962395", "openalex:W2108020239", "openalex:W2108301231", "openalex:W2108579733", "openalex:W2110957653", "openalex:W2115460576", "openalex:W2120079537", "openalex:W2122458046", "openalex:W2128666650", "openalex:W2132960888", "openalex:W2135861595", "openalex:W2137411342", "openalex:W2140487181", "openalex:W2142823391", "openalex:W2148544865", "openalex:W2149636831", "openalex:W2151496011", "openalex:W2153791616", "openalex:W2155986100", "openalex:W2156358825", "openalex:W2157376352", "openalex:W2158553737", "openalex:W2172187797", "openalex:W2280014445", "openalex:W2317030384", "openalex:W2346160145", "openalex:W2414486637", "openalex:W2415954501", "openalex:W2461939826", "openalex:W2463330366", "openalex:W2481263544", "openalex:W2498492890", "openalex:W2516447969", "openalex:W2519649706", "openalex:W2520342164", "openalex:W2530226740", "openalex:W2531760904", "openalex:W2547057105", "openalex:W2552810632", "openalex:W2563109517", "openalex:W2584391386", "openalex:W2601234273", "openalex:W2617660370", "openalex:W2618517468", "openalex:W2623066203", "openalex:W2740651538", "openalex:W2743911451", "openalex:W2744535290", "openalex:W2754844655", "openalex:W2769704218", "openalex:W2783657280", "openalex:W2788661968", "openalex:W2789154098", "openalex:W2789821003", "openalex:W2797051230", "openalex:W2798149936", "openalex:W2802947734", "openalex:W2807844797", "openalex:W2875797025", "openalex:W2890724683", "openalex:W2892266804", "openalex:W2901555861", "openalex:W2905334783", "openalex:W2908555537", "openalex:W2920061658", "openalex:W2922525160", "openalex:W2928639725", "openalex:W2945533077", "openalex:W2947609478", "openalex:W2949486593", "openalex:W2954626430", "openalex:W2962820648", "openalex:W2969815228", "openalex:W2972527800", "openalex:W2980655938", "openalex:W2992533179", "openalex:W3100924163", "openalex:W3103782180", "openalex:W3121988744", "openalex:W4232663066", "openalex:W4237718205", "openalex:W4242339156", "openalex:W4247883378", "openalex:W4254562683", "openalex:W4388252848", "openalex:W6682671827", "openalex:W6730278946", "openalex:W6765174732", "openalex:W6907898498"], "publication_date": null}

Unlike robots, humans learn, adapt and perceive their body as a unity when interacting with the world. Here we investigate the suitability of Active inference, a computational model proposed for the brain and governed by the free-energy principle, for robotic body perception and action in a non-simulated environment. We designed and deployed the algorithm on the humanoid iCub showing how our proposed model enabled the robot to have adaptive body perception and to perform robust upper-body reaching and head object tracking behaviours even under high levels of sensor noise and discrepancies between the model and the real robot. Estimation and control are formalized as an inference problem where the body posterior state distribution is approximated by means of the variational free-energy bound, yielding to a minimization of the prediction error. Besides, our study forecasts reactive actions in the presence of sensorimotor conflicts, a mechanism that may be relevant in human body adaptation to uncertain situations.", "authors": [{"name": "Guillermo Oliver", "affiliation": "University of Alicante", "orcid": "0000-0002-4304-1457"}, {"name": "Pablo Lanillos", "affiliation": "Radboud University Nijmegen", "orcid": "0000-0001-9154-0798"}, {"name": "Gordon Cheng", "affiliation": "Technical University of Munich", "orcid": "0000-0003-0770-8717"}], "year": 2021, "doi": "10.1109/tcds.2021.3049907", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W3120701370", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental Systems", "citation_count": 61, "references": ["openalex:W265158842", "openalex:W1570770495", "openalex:W1963832262", "openalex:W1965555277", "openalex:W2089029564", "openalex:W2110525007", "openalex:W2113257799", "openalex:W2127958135", "openalex:W2130195834", "openalex:W2132003317", "openalex:W2148764920", "openalex:W2155772159", "openalex:W2167501464", "openalex:W2301129842", "openalex:W2525228457", "openalex:W2529113322", "openalex:W2537677623", "openalex:W2553496799", "openalex:W2553874547", "openalex:W2601856331", "openalex:W2617660370", "openalex:W2769704218", "openalex:W2783111293", "openalex:W2783657280", "openalex:W2787387368", "openalex:W2801487100", "openalex:W2808011553", "openalex:W2949418440", "openalex:W2963932186", "openalex:W2976738340", "openalex:W2999994890", "openalex:W3007127011", "openalex:W3111153115", "openalex:W4311415873", "openalex:W6693263383", "openalex:W6788495035"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Smooth Pursuit and Visual Occlusion: Active Inference and Oculomotor Control in Schizophrenia", "abstract": "This paper introduces a model of oculomotor control during the smooth pursuit of occluded visual targets. This model is based upon active inference, in which subjects try to minimise their (proprioceptive) prediction error based upon posterior beliefs about the hidden causes of their (exteroceptive) sensory input. Our model appeals to a single principle--the minimisation of variational free energy--to provide Bayes optimal solutions to the smooth pursuit problem. However, it tries to accommodate the cardinal features of smooth pursuit of partially occluded targets that have been observed empirically in normal subjects and schizophrenia. Specifically, we account for the ability of normal subjects to anticipate periodic target trajectories and emit pre-emptive smooth pursuit eye movements--prior to the emergence of a target from behind an occluder. Furthermore, we show that a single deficit in the postsynaptic gain of prediction error units (encoding the precision of posterior beliefs) can account for several features of smooth pursuit in schizophrenia: namely, a reduction in motor gain and anticipatory eye movements during visual occlusion, a paradoxical improvement in tracking unpredicted deviations from target trajectories and a failure to recognise and exploit regularities in the periodic motion of visual targets. This model will form the basis of subsequent (dynamic causal) models of empirical eye tracking measurements, which we hope to validate, using psychopharmacology and studies of schizophrenia.", "authors": [{"name": "Rick A.

{"title": "Active inference leads to Bayesian neurophysiology", "abstract": "The neuronal substrates that implement the free-energy principle and ensuing active inference at the neuron and synapse level have not been fully elucidated. This Review considers possible neuronal substrates underlying the principle. First, the foundations of the free-energy principle are introduced, and then its ability to empirically explain various brain functions and psychological and biological phenomena in terms of Bayesian inference is described. Mathematically, the dynamics of neural activity and plasticity that minimise a cost function can be cast as performing Bayesian inference that minimises variational free energy. This equivalence licenses the adoption of the free-energy principle as a universal characterisation of neural networks. Further, the neural network structure itself represents a generative model under which an agent operates. A virtue of this perspective is that it enables the formal association of neural network properties with prior beliefs that regulate inference and learning. The possible neuronal substrates that implement prior and posterior beliefs and how to empirically examine the theory are discussed. This perspective renders brain activity explainable, leading to a deeper understanding of the neuronal mechanisms underlying basic psychology and psychiatric disorders in terms of an implicit generative model.", "authors": [{"name": "Takuya Isomura", "affiliation": "RIKEN Center for Brain Science", "orcid": "0000-0003-2960-4919"}], "year": 2021, "doi": "10.1016/j.neures.2021.12.003", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W4200582713", "venue": "Neuroscience Research", "citation_count": 33, "references": ["openalex:W1501028655", "openalex:W1520415431", "openalex:W1601795611", "openalex:W1661597557", "openalex:W1977628053", "openalex:W1978453114", "openalex:W1985940938", "openalex:W1986246844", "openalex:W1988520084", "openalex:W1993868308", "openalex:W2004652753", "openalex:W2009782005", "openalex:W2010124835", "openalex:W2015144766", "openalex:W2023097449", "openalex:W2024149692", "openalex:W2026799324", "openalex:W2030513087", "openalex:W2039236689", "openalex:W2040128952", "openalex:W2041848110", "openalex:W2043849093", "openalex:W2046517948", "openalex:W2049114067", "openalex:W2050066016", "openalex:W2055523610", "openalex:W2055789905", "openalex:W2059095731", "openalex:W2063856415", "openalex:W2070461647", "openalex:W2076217198", "openalex:W2094342172", "openalex:W2097861969", "openalex:W2099231026", "openalex:W2101645771", "openalex:W2107362261", "openalex:W2111947800", "openalex:W2116533103", "openalex:W2119885245", "openalex:W2120079537", "openalex:W2122925692", "openalex:W2125191661", "openalex:W2127918219", "openalex:W2127958135", "openalex:W2132003317", "openalex:W2140487181", "openalex:W2145889472", "openalex:W2147008239", "openalex:W2147101007", "openalex:W2148764920", "openalex:W2159275967", "openalex:W2161563886", "openalex:W2169356885", "openalex:W2176033094", "openalex:W2211598849", "openalex:W2271476098", "openalex:W2408670836", "openalex:W2463330366", "openalex:W2522169164", "openalex:W2552810632", "openalex:W2623066203", "openalex:W2726920196", "openalex:W2753961618", "openalex:W2769704218", "openalex:W2781668895", "openalex:W2802447849", "openalex:W2952777976", "openalex:W2954626430", "openalex:W2980655938", "openalex:W2994602346", "openalex:W2996530576", "openalex:W3017302611", "openalex:W3087248248", "openalex:W3204968473", "openalex:W4205386412", "openalex:W4213348475", "openalex:W6603267330", "openalex:W6713989974", "openalex:W6765174732"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Simulating Active Inference Processes by Message Passing", "abstract": "The free energy principle (FEP) offers a variational calculus-based description for how biological agents persevere through interactions with their environment. Active inference (AI) is a corollary of the FEP, which states that biological agents act to fulfill prior beliefs about preferred future observations (target priors). Purposeful behavior then results from variational free energy minimization with respect to a generative model of the environment with included target priors. However, manual derivations for free energy minimizing algorithms on custom dynamic models can become tedious and error-prone. While probabilistic programming (PP) techniques enable automatic derivation of inference algorithms on free-form models, full automation of AI requires specialized tools for inference on dynamic models, together with the description of an experimental protocol that governs the interaction between the agent and its simulated environment. The contributions of the present paper are two-fold. Firstly, we illustrate how AI can be automated with the use of ForneyLab, a recent PP toolbox that specializes in variational inference on flexibly definable dynamic models. More specifically, we describe AI agents in a dynamic environment as probabilistic state space models (SSM) and perform inference for perception and control in these agents by message passing on a factor graph representation of the SSM. Secondly, we propose a formal experimental protocol for simulated AI. We exemplify how this protocol leads to goal-directed behavior for flexibly definable AI agents in two classical RL examples, namely the Bayesian thermostat and the mountain car parking problems.", "authors": [{"name": "Thijs van de Laar", "affiliation": "Eindhoven University of Technology", "orcid": "0000-0003-3936-5368"}, {"name": "Bert de Vries", "affiliation": "Eindhoven University of Technology", "orcid": "0000-0003-0839-174X"}], "year": 2019, "doi": "10.3389/frobt.2019.00020", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W2929539807", "venue": "Frontiers in Robotics and AI", "citation_count": 39, "references": ["openalex:W311820753", "openalex:W1511986666", "openalex:W1592847719", "openalex:W1720321157", "openalex:W1971715144", "openalex:W2040891197", "openalex:W2050883740", "openalex:W2052398297", "openalex:W2052963087", "openalex:W2055789905", "openalex:W2059320470", "openalex:W2070813962", "openalex:W2071739800", "openalex:W2091405003", "openalex:W2096375888", "openalex:W2106131716", "openalex:W2119885245", "openalex:W2120575449", "openalex:W2121863487", "openalex:W2137411342", "openalex:W2139584447", "openalex:W2147008239", "openalex:W2148764920", "openalex:W2150859678", "openalex:W2154023516", "openalex:W2157376352", "openalex:W2403726878", "openalex:W2463330366", "openalex:W2525228457", "openalex:W2539792571", "openalex:W2577537660", "openalex:W2604272474", "openalex:W2606488938", "openalex:W2612972698", "openalex:W2616052791", "openalex:W2617660370", "openalex:W2623066203", "openalex:W2753555157", "openalex:W2754844655", "openalex:W2767022047", "openalex:W2769704218", "openalex:W2798667480", "openalex:W2875797025", "openalex:W2898878670", "openalex:W2899947052", "openalex:W2903198223", "openalex:W2905715709", "openalex:W2963895729", "openalex:W2976973594", "openalex:W3098156617", "openalex:W4212863985", "openalex:W4230449744", "openalex:W4237718205", "openalex:W4300423539", "openalex:W6673894883", "openalex:W6681997382", "openalex:W6682489347", "openalex:W6713578759", "openalex:W6728380505", "openalex:W6756458199"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Active inference models do not contradict folk psychology", "abstract": "Abstract Active inference offers a unified theory of perception, learning, and decision-making at computational and neural levels of description. In this article, we address the worry that active inference may be in tension with the belief–desire–intention (BDI) model within folk psychology because it does not include terms for desires (or other conative constructs) at the mathematical level of description. To resolve this concern, we first provide a brief review of the historical progression from predictive coding to active inference, enabling us to distinguish between active inference formulations of motor control (which need not have desires under folk psychology) and active inference formulations of decision processes (which do have desires within folk psychology). We then show that, despite a superficial tension when viewed at the mathematical level of description, the active inference formalism contains terms that are readily identifiable as encoding both the objects of desire and the strength of desire at the psychological level of description. We demonstrate this with simple simulations of an active inference agent motivated to leave a dark room for different reasons. Despite their consistency, we further show how active inference may increase the granularity of folk-psychological descriptions by highlighting distinctions between drives to seek information versus reward—and how it may also offer more precise, quantitative folk-psychological predictions. Finally, we consider how the implicitly conative components of active inference may have partial analogues (i.e., “as if” desires) in other systems describable by the broader free energy principle to which it conforms.", "authors": [{"name": "Ryan Smith", "affiliation": "Laureate Institute for Brain Research", "orcid": "0000-0002-4448-185X"}, {"name": "Maxwell J.

{"title": "The Radically Embodied Conscious Cybernetic Bayesian Brain: From Free Energy to Free Will and Back Again", "abstract": "Drawing from both enactivist and cognitivist perspectives on mind, I propose that explaining teleological phenomena may require reappraising both “Cartesian theaters” and mental homunculi in terms of embodied self-models (ESMs), understood as body maps with agentic properties, functioning as predictive-memory systems and cybernetic controllers. Quasi-homuncular ESMs are suggested to constitute a major organizing principle for neural architectures due to their initial and ongoing significance for solutions to inference problems in cognitive (and affective) development. Embodied experiences provide foundational lessons in learning curriculums in which agents explore increasingly challenging problem spaces, so answering an unresolved question in Bayesian cognitive science: what are biologically plausible mechanisms for equipping learners with sufficiently powerful inductive biases to adequately constrain inference spaces? Drawing on models from neurophysiology, psychology, and developmental robotics, I describe how embodiment provides fundamental sources of empirical priors (as reliably learnable posterior expectations). If ESMs play this kind of foundational role in cognitive development, then bidirectional linkages will be found between all sensory modalities and frontal-parietal control hierarchies, so infusing all senses with somatic-motoric properties, thereby structuring all perception by relevant affordances, so solving frame problems for embodied agents. Drawing upon the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference framework, I describe a particular mechanism for intentional action selection via consciously imagined (and explicitly represented) goal realization, where contrasts between desired and present states influence ongoing policy selection via predictive coding mechanisms and backward-chained imaginings (as self-realizing predictions). This embodied developmental legacy suggests a mechanism by which imaginings can be intentionally shaped by (internalized) partially-expressed motor acts, so providing means of agentic control for attention, working memory, imagination, and behavior. I further describe the nature(s) of mental causation and self-control, and also provide an account of readiness potentials in Libet paradigms wherein conscious intentions shape causal streams leading to enaction. Finally, I provide neurophenomenological handlings of prototypical qualia including pleasure, pain, and desire in terms of self-annihilating free energy gradients via quasi-synesthetic interoceptive active inference. In brief, this manuscript is intended to illustrate how radically embodied minds may create foundations for intelligence (as capacity for learning and inference), consciousness (as somatically-grounded self-world modeling), and will (as deployment of predictive models for enacting valued goals).", "authors": [{"name": "Adam Safron", "affiliation": "Indiana University

{"title": "An Integrated World Modeling Theory (IWMT) of consciousness: Combining Integrated Information and Global Neuronal Workspace Theories with the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference Framework; towards solving the Hard problem and characterizing agentic causation", "abstract": "The Free Energy Principle and Active Inference Framework (FEP-AI) begins with the understanding that persisting systems must regulate environmental exchanges and prevent entropic accumulation. In FEP-AI, minds and brains are predictive controllers for autonomous systems, where action-driven perception is realized as probabilistic inference. Integrated Information Theory (IIT) begins with considering the preconditions for a system to intrinsically exist, as well as axioms regarding the nature of consciousness. IIT has produced controversy because of its surprising entailments: quasi-panpsychism; subjectivity without referents or dynamics; and the possibility of fully-intelligent-yet-unconscious brain simulations. Here, I describe how these controversies might be resolved by integrating IIT with FEP-AI, where integrated information only entails consciousness for systems with perspectival reference frames capable of generating models with spatial, temporal, and causal coherence for self and world. Without that connection with external reality, systems could have arbitrarily high amounts of integrated information, but nonetheless would not entail subjective experience. I further describe how an integration of these frameworks may contribute to their evolution as unified systems theories and models of emergent causation. Then, inspired by both Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT) and the Harmonic Brain Modes framework, I describe how streams of consciousness may emerge as an evolving generation of sensorimotor predictions, with the precise composition of experiences depending on the integration abilities of synchronous complexes as self-organizing harmonic modes (SOHMs). These integrating dynamics may be particularly likely to occur via richly connected subnetworks affording body-centric sources of phenomenal binding and executive control. Along these connectivity backbones, SOHMs are proposed to implement loopy message passing (cf. turbo-codes) over predictive (autoencoding) networks, so generating maximum a posteriori estimates as coherent vectors governing neural evolution, with alpha frequencies generating basic awareness, and cross-frequency phase-coupling within theta frequencies for access consciousness and volitional control. These dynamic cores of integrated information also function as global workspaces, centered on posterior cortices, but capable of being entrained with frontal cortices and interoceptive hierarchies, so affording agentic causation. Integrated World Modeling Theory (IWMT) represents a synthetic approach to understanding minds that reveals compatibility between leading theories of consciousness, so enabling inferential synergy.",

{"title": "Whatever next? Predictive brains, situated agents, and the future of cognitive science", "abstract": "Abstract Brains, it has recently been argued, are essentially prediction machines. They are bundles of cells that support perception and action by constantly attempting to match incoming sensory inputs with top-down expectations or predictions. This is achieved using a hierarchical generative model that aims to minimize prediction error within a bidirectional cascade of cortical processing. Such accounts offer a unifying model of perception and action, illuminate the functional role of attention, and may neatly capture the special contribution of cortical processing to adaptive success. This target article critically examines this “hierarchical prediction machine” approach, concluding that it offers the best clue yet to the shape of a unified science of mind and action. Sections 1 and 2 lay out the key elements and implications of the approach. Section 3 explores a variety of pitfalls and challenges, spanning the evidential, the methodological, and the more properly conceptual. The paper ends (sections 4 and 5) by asking how such approaches might impact our more general vision of mind, experience, and agency.", "authors": [{"name": "Andy Clark", "affiliation": "University of

{"title": "Reward Maximization Through Discrete Active Inference", "abstract": "Abstract Active inference is a probabilistic framework for modeling the behavior of biological and artificial agents, which derives from the principle of minimizing free energy. In recent years, this framework has been applied successfully to a variety of situations where the goal was to maximize reward, often offering comparable and sometimes superior performance to alternative approaches. In this article, we clarify the connection between reward maximization and active inference by demonstrating how and when active inference agents execute actions that are optimal for maximizing reward. Precisely, we show the conditions under which active inference produces the optimal solution to the Bellman equation, a formulation that underlies several approaches to model-based reinforcement learning and control. On partially observed Markov decision processes, the standard active inference scheme can produce Bellman optimal actions for planning horizons of 1 but not beyond. In contrast, a recently developed recursive active inference scheme (sophisticated inference) can produce Bellman optimal actions on any finite temporal horizon. We append the analysis with a discussion of the broader relationship between active inference and reinforcement learning.", "authors": [{"name": "Lancelot Da Costa", "affiliation": "Imperial College

{"title": "Free energy: a user’s guide", "abstract": "Abstract Over the last fifteen years, an ambitious explanatory framework has been proposed to unify explanations across biology and cognitive science. Active inference, whose most famous tenet is the free energy principle, has inspired excitement and confusion in equal measure. Here, we lay the ground for proper critical analysis of active inference, in three ways. First, we give simplified versions of its core mathematical models. Second, we outline the historical development of active inference and its relationship to other theoretical approaches. Third, we describe three different kinds of claim—labelled mathematical, empirical and general—routinely made by proponents of the framework, and suggest dialectical links between them. Overall, we aim to increase philosophical understanding of active inference so that it may be more readily evaluated.

{"title": "PID Control as a Process of Active Inference with Linear Generative Model", "abstract": "In the past few decades, probabilistic interpretations of brain functions have become widespread in cognitive science and neuroscience. In particular, the free energy principle and active inference are increasingly popular theories of cognitive functions that claim to offer a unified understanding of life and cognition within a general mathematical framework derived from information and control theory, and statistical mechanics. However, we argue that if the active inference proposal is to be taken as a general process theory for biological systems, it is necessary to understand how it relates to existing control theoretical approaches routinely used to study and explain biological systems. For example, recently, PID control has been shown to be implemented in simple molecular systems and is becoming a popular mechanistic explanation of behaviours such as chemotaxis in bacteria and amoebae, and robust adaptation in biochemical networks. In this work, we will show how PID controllers can fit a more general theory of life and cognition under the principle of (variational) free energy minimisation when using approximate linear generative models of the world. This more general interpretation provides also a new perspective on traditional problems of PID controllers such as parameter tuning as well as the need to balance performances and robustness conditions of a controller. Specifically, we then show how these problems can be understood in terms of the optimisation of the precisions (inverse variances) modulating different prediction errors in the free energy functional.", "authors": [{"name": "Manuel Baltieri", "affiliation": "University of Sussex", "orcid": "0000-0002-6086-4711"}, {"name": "Christopher L.

{"title": "The Physical Meaning of the Holographic Principle", "abstract": "We show in this pedagogical review that far from being an apparent law of physics that stands by itself, the holographic principle is a straightforward consequence of the quantum information theory of separable systems. It provides a basis for the theories of measurement, time, and scattering. Utilizing the notion of holographic screens, which are information encoding boundaries between physical subsystems, we demonstrate that the physical interaction is an information exchange during which information is strictly conserved. Then we use generalized holographic principle in order to flesh out a fully-general quantum theory of measurement in which the measurement produces finite-resolution, classical outcomes. Further, we show that the measurements are given meaning by quantum reference frames and sequential measurements induce topological quantum field theories. Finally, we discuss principles equivalent to the holographic principle, including Markov blankets and the free-energy principle in biology, multiple realizability and virtual machines in computer science, and active inference and interface theories in cognitive science. This appearance in multiple disciplines suggests that the holographic principle is not just a fundamental principle of physics, but of all of science.Quanta 2022; 11: 72–96.", "authors": [{"name": "C.

We examine how active inference is able to account for temporal nestedness of conscious experience and for the concern or care that is the main structure of first-person experience according to phenomenological philosophy.

It demonstrates empirically that predictive coding and active inference approaches can be successfully scaled up to tasks more challenging than the mountain car (Friston 2009, 2012). We show that hierarchical predictive coding models can be learned from scratch during the task, and can successfully drive action selection via active inference. To our knowledge, it is the first implemented active inference agent to combine active inference with a hierarchical predictive coding perceptual model. We also provide a tutorial walk-through of the free-energy principle, hierarchical predictive coding, and active inference, including an in-depth derivation of our agent.", "authors": [{"name": "Beren Millidge", "affiliation": "University of Edinburgh", "orcid": "0000-0003-1872-5635"}], "year": 2019, "doi": "10.31234/osf.io/kf6wc", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W3161961853", "venue": null, "citation_count": 23, "references": ["openalex:W6908809", "openalex:W104184427", "openalex:W429906369", "openalex:W1522301498", "openalex:W1523559433", "openalex:W1533861849", "openalex:W1836465849", "openalex:W1959608418", "openalex:W1969139884", "openalex:W1973845142", "openalex:W1977628053", "openalex:W1978549608", "openalex:W1981905332", "openalex:W1994565738", "openalex:W2016092929", "openalex:W2017726896", "openalex:W2059320470", "openalex:W2090615529", "openalex:W2091405003", "openalex:W2093466600", "openalex:W2098084154", "openalex:W2111947800", "openalex:W2113257799", "openalex:W2113773025", "openalex:W2115979064", "openalex:W2119885245", "openalex:W2120079537", "openalex:W2120536867", "openalex:W2122458046", "openalex:W2127958135", "openalex:W2130195834", "openalex:W2131352719", "openalex:W2132003317", "openalex:W2137411342", "openalex:W2143072483", "openalex:W2147008239", "openalex:W2148764920", "openalex:W2154123408", "openalex:W2157376352", "openalex:W2171916839", "openalex:W2237059274", "openalex:W2408670836", "openalex:W2463330366", "openalex:W2486594907", "openalex:W2552810632", "openalex:W2617660370", "openalex:W2783378914", "openalex:W2783657280", "openalex:W2875797025", "openalex:W2909444209", "openalex:W2949846339", "openalex:W2963090522", "openalex:W3101380508", "openalex:W4249210107", "openalex:W4255064568", "openalex:W4300537377", "openalex:W4301046954", "openalex:W4394666657", "openalex:W4394666973"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "The relationship between dynamic programming and active inference: the discrete, finite-horizon case.", "abstract": "Active inference is a normative framework for generating behaviour based upon the free energy principle, a theory of self-organisation. This framework has been successfully used to solve reinforcement learning and stochastic control problems, yet, the formal relation between active inference and reward maximisation has not been fully explicated. In this paper, we consider the relation between active inference and dynamic programming under the Bellman equation, which underlies many approaches to reinforcement learning and control. We show that, on partially observable Markov decision processes, dynamic programming is a limiting case of active inference. In active inference, agents select actions to minimise expected free energy. In the absence of ambiguity about states, this reduces to matching expected states with a target distribution encoding the agent's preferences. When target states correspond to rewarding states, this maximises expected reward, as in reinforcement learning. When states are ambiguous, active inference agents will choose actions that simultaneously minimise ambiguity. This allows active inference agents to supplement their reward maximising (or exploitative) behaviour with novelty-seeking (or exploratory) behaviour.

The majority of studies have focussed on the role of mirror neurons and the network of cortical areas active during action observation (AON) in inferring the goal of an observed action. However, it remains unclear what precisely is simulated when we observe an action and how such simulations can enable the observer to infer the underlying intention of that action. In particular it is not known how simulation in the AON enables the inference of the same goal when the kinematics observed to achieve that goal differ, such as when reaching to grasp an object with the left or right hands. Here we performed a behavioural study with healthy human subjects to address this question. We show that the subjects were able to detect very subtle changes in the kinematics of an observed action. In addition, we fitted the behavioural responses with a model based on the predictive coding account of mirror neurons. This is a Bayesian account of action observation that can be explained by the free‐energy principle. Here we show that we can model all the effects observed when the action observation system is considered within a predictive coding framework.", "authors": [{"name": "Alice Neal", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0002-4623-6102"}, {"name": "James M.

{"title": "Control Flow in Active Inference Systems—Part I: Classical and Quantum Formulations of Active Inference", "abstract": "Living systems face both environmental complexity and limited access to free-energy resources. Survival under these conditions requires a control system that can activate, or deploy, available perception and action resources in a context specific way. In this Part I, we introduce the free-energy principle (FEP) and the idea of active inference as Bayesian prediction-error minimization, and show how the control problem arises in active inference systems. We then review classical and quantum formulations of the FEP, with the former being the classical limit of the latter. In the accompanying Part II, we show that when systems are described as executing active inference driven by the FEP, their control flow systems can always be represented as tensor networks (TNs). We show how TNs as control systems can be implemented within the general framework of quantum topological neural networks, and discuss the implications of these results for modeling biological systems at multiple scales.", "authors": [{"name": "Chris Fields", "affiliation": "Tufts University", "orcid": "0000-0002-4812-0744"}, {"name": "Filippo Fabrocini", "affiliation": "National Research Council", "orcid": "0000-0002-6972-1020"}, {"name": "Karl Friston", "affiliation": "University College London", "orcid": "0000-0001-7984-8909"}, {"name": "James F.

{"title": "Limiting the explanatory scope of extended active inference: the implications of a causal pattern analysis of selective niche construction, developmental niche construction, and organism-niche coordination dynamics", "abstract": "Abstract Research in evolutionary biology and philosophy of biology and cognition strongly suggests that human organisms modify their environment through active processes of niche construction. Recently, proponents of the free-energy principle and variational active inference have argued that their approach can deepen our understanding of the reciprocal causal relationship between organisms and their niche on various scales. This paper examines the feasibility and scope of variational formalisations and conceptualisations of the organism-niche nexus with a particular focus on the extended active inference account. I will draw a conceptual distinction between selective niche construction, developmental niche construction, and organism-niche coordination dynamics and argue that these notions capture different causal patterns, each of which with a distinct scope. Against this background, I will analyse and discuss the extended active inference account and its strategy to integrate variational active inference with work on extended cognition. The proponents of extended active inference assume that their account can provide an explanation of selective niche construction, developmental niche construction, and organism-niche coordination dynamics. However, my key claim will be that this account has the potential to elucidate the workings of organism-niche coordination dynamics, but does not adequately capture the causal patterns of selective niche construction and developmental niche construction.", "authors": [{"name": "Regina E.

{"title": "Connecting the free energy principle with quantum cognition", "abstract": "It appears that the free energy minimization principle conflicts with quantum cognition since the former adheres to a restricted view based on experience while the latter allows deviations from such a restricted view. While free energy minimization, which incorporates Bayesian inference, leads to a Boolean lattice of propositions (classical logic), quantum cognition, which seems to be very dissimilar to Bayesian inference, leads to an orthomodular lattice of propositions (quantum logic). Thus, we address this challenging issue to bridge and connect the free energy minimization principle with the theory of quantum cognition. In this work, we introduce “excess Bayesian inference” and show that this excess Bayesian inference entails an underlying orthomodular lattice, while classic Bayesian inference entails a Boolean lattice. Excess Bayesian inference is implemented by extending the key idea of Bayesian inference beyond classic Bayesian inference and its variations. It is constructed by enhancing the idea of active inference and/or embodied intelligence. The appropriate lattice structure of its logic is obtained from a binary relation transformed from a distribution of the joint probabilities of data and hypotheses by employing a rough-set lattice technique in accordance with quantum cognition logic.", "authors": [{"name": "Yukio‐Pegio Gunji", "affiliation": "Waseda University", "orcid": "0000-0002-0462-4932"}, {"name": "Shuji Shinohara", "affiliation": "Tokyo Denki University", "orcid": "0000-0001-8442-836X"}, {"name": "Vasileios Basios", "affiliation": "Université Libre de Bruxelles", "orcid": "0000-0002-1199-4552"}], "year": 2022, "doi": "10.3389/fnbot.2022.910161", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W4294193036", "venue": "Frontiers in Neurorobotics", "citation_count": 14, "references": ["openalex:W1487117175", "openalex:W1508593203", "openalex:W1818533712", "openalex:W1823011342", "openalex:W1915024344", "openalex:W1973243121", "openalex:W2023730779", "openalex:W2080497921", "openalex:W2082241885", "openalex:W2096375888", "openalex:W2105232709", "openalex:W2147008239", "openalex:W2147986396", "openalex:W2148764920", "openalex:W2413329294", "openalex:W2485587655", "openalex:W2501059747", "openalex:W2520893533", "openalex:W2530226740", "openalex:W2561675875", "openalex:W2564601941", "openalex:W2566832624", "openalex:W2793764002", "openalex:W2889373600", "openalex:W2900218957", "openalex:W2900581158", "openalex:W2977321575", "openalex:W2979533087", "openalex:W3000436493", "openalex:W3008716087", "openalex:W3022812413", "openalex:W3039732669", "openalex:W3092968205", "openalex:W3105799481", "openalex:W3112607898", "openalex:W3114520767", "openalex:W3127432213", "openalex:W3159995865", "openalex:W3180219341", "openalex:W3212145508", "openalex:W4214637195", "openalex:W4224305793", "openalex:W4231563569", "openalex:W4236251876", "openalex:W6630190730", "openalex:W6635834061", "openalex:W6684899708", "openalex:W6715659164"], "publication_date": null}

{"title": "Bayesian policy selection using active inference", "abstract": "Learning to take actions based on observations is a core requirement for artificial agents to be able to be successful and robust at their task. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a well-known technique for learning such policies. However, current RL algorithms often have to deal with reward shaping, have difficulties generalizing to other environments and are most often sample inefficient. In this paper, we explore active inference and the free energy principle, a normative theory from neuroscience that explains how self-organizing biological systems operate by maintaining a model of the world and casting action selection as an inference problem. We apply this concept to a typical problem known to the RL community, the mountain car problem, and show how active inference encompasses both RL and learning from demonstrations.", "authors": [{"name": "Ozan Çatal", "affiliation": "Ghent University", "orcid": "0000-0002-0216-7918"}, {"name": "Johannes Nauta", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0002-5859-2729"}, {"name": "Tim Verbelen", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0003-2731-7262"}, {"name": "Pieter Simoens", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0002-9569-9373"}, {"name": "Bart Dhoedt", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0002-7271-7479"}], "year": 2019, "doi": "10.48550/arxiv.1904.08149", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W2935889419", "venue": "arXiv (Cornell University)", "citation_count": 22, "references": ["openalex:W1952433512", "openalex:W1959608418", "openalex:W1985658808", "openalex:W2061562262", "openalex:W2091405003", "openalex:W2093466600", "openalex:W2147008239", "openalex:W2148764920", "openalex:W2257979135", "openalex:W2529658650", "openalex:W2552810632", "openalex:W2596367596", "openalex:W2610395436", "openalex:W2761873684", "openalex:W2795756076", "openalex:W2877093712", "openalex:W2892266804", "openalex:W2933723475", "openalex:W2962732055", "openalex:W2962897886", "openalex:W2963484919", "openalex:W2963937357"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "NEUROBEHAVIORAL PROBES FOR ADEQUACY OF DIALYSIS", "abstract": "The free energy principle (FEP) offers a variational calculus-based description for how biological agents persevere through interactions with their environment. Active inference (AI) is a corollary of the FEP, which states that biological agents act to fulfill prior beliefs about preferred future observations (target priors). Purposeful behavior then results from variational free energy minimization with respect to a generative model of the environment with included target priors. However, manual derivations for free energy minimizing algorithms on custom dynamic models can become tedious and error-prone. While probabilistic programming (PP) techniques enable automatic derivation of inference algorithms on free-form models, full automation of AI requires specialized tools for inference on dynamic models, together with the description of an experimental protocol that governs the interaction between the agent and its simulated environment. The contributions of the present paper are two-fold. Firstly, we illustrate how AI can be automated with the use of ForneyLab, a recent PP toolbox that specializes in variational inference on flexibly definable dynamic models. More specifically, we describe AI agents in a dynamic environment as probabilistic state space models (SSM) and perform inference for perception and control in these agents by message passing on a factor graph representation of the SSM. Secondly, we propose a formal experimental protocol for simulated AI. We exemplify how this protocol leads to goal-directed behavior for flexibly definable AI agents in two classical RL examples, namely the Bayesian thermostat and the mountain car parking problems.", "authors": [{"name": "Paul E.

{"title": "Active inference body perception and action for humanoid robots", "abstract": "Providing artificial agents with the same computational models of biological systems is a way to understand how intelligent behaviours may emerge. We present an active inference body perception and action model working for the first time in a humanoid robot. The model relies on the free energy principle proposed for the brain, where both perception and action goal is to minimise the prediction error through gradient descent on the variational free energy bound. The body state (latent variable) is inferred by minimising the difference between the observed (visual and proprioceptive) sensor values and the predicted ones. Simultaneously, the action makes sensory data sampling to better correspond to the prediction made by the inner model. We formalised and implemented the algorithm on the iCub robot and tested in 2D and 3D visual spaces for online adaptation to visual changes, sensory noise and discrepancies between the model and the real robot. We also compared our approach with classical inverse kinematics in a reaching task, analysing the suitability of such a neuroscience-inspired approach for real-world interaction. The algorithm gave the robot adaptive body perception and upper body reaching with head object tracking (toddler-like), and was able to incorporate visual features online (in a closed-loop manner) without increasing the computational complexity. Moreover, our model predicted involuntary actions in the presence of sensorimotor conflicts showing the path for a potential proof of active inference in humans.", "authors": [{"name": "Guillermo Oliver", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0002-4304-1457"}, {"name": "Pablo Lanillos", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0001-9154-0798"}, {"name": "Gordon Cheng", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0003-0770-8717"}], "year": 2019, "doi": "10.48550/arxiv.1906.03022", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W2948283202", "venue": "arXiv (Cornell University)", "citation_count": 28, "references": ["openalex:W1641311894", "openalex:W1963832262", "openalex:W1965555277", "openalex:W1980440818", "openalex:W2082285558", "openalex:W2089029564", "openalex:W2100119371", "openalex:W2110525007", "openalex:W2113257799", "openalex:W2127958135", "openalex:W2130195834", "openalex:W2132003317", "openalex:W2148764920", "openalex:W2237059274", "openalex:W2263344904", "openalex:W2301129842", "openalex:W2525228457", "openalex:W2529113322", "openalex:W2537677623", "openalex:W2553874547", "openalex:W2617660370", "openalex:W2769704218", "openalex:W2783111293", "openalex:W2783657280", "openalex:W2787387368", "openalex:W2801487100", "openalex:W2808011553", "openalex:W2949418440", "openalex:W2963932186", "openalex:W3121096322"], "publication_date": null}

{"title": "Cognition as Morphological/Morphogenetic Embodied Computation In Vivo", "abstract": "Cognition, historically considered uniquely human capacity, has been recently found to be the ability of all living organisms, from single cells and up. This study approaches cognition from an info-computational stance, in which structures in nature are seen as information, and processes (information dynamics) are seen as computation, from the perspective of a cognizing agent. Cognition is understood as a network of concurrent morphological/morphogenetic computations unfolding as a result of self-assembly, self-organization, and autopoiesis of physical, chemical, and biological agents. The present-day human-centric view of cognition still prevailing in major encyclopedias has a variety of open problems. This article considers recent research about morphological computation, morphogenesis, agency, basal cognition, extended evolutionary synthesis, free energy principle, cognition as Bayesian learning, active inference, and related topics, offering new theoretical and practical perspectives on problems inherent to the old computationalist cognitive models which were based on abstract symbol processing, and unaware of actual physical constraints and affordances of the embodiment of cognizing agents. A better understanding of cognition is centrally important for future artificial intelligence, robotics, medicine, and related fields.", "authors": [{"name": "Gordana Dodig-Crnković", "affiliation": "Mälardalen University", "orcid": "0000-0001-9881-400X"}], "year": 2022, "doi": "10.3390/e24111576", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W4307747331", "venue": "Entropy", "citation_count": 39, "references": ["openalex:W124344991", "openalex:W154296347", "openalex:W229723928", "openalex:W797248838", "openalex:W911666850", "openalex:W1010487916", "openalex:W1504499192", "openalex:W1564034482", "openalex:W1620203002", "openalex:W1848111121", "openalex:W1984638028", "openalex:W1991285543", "openalex:W2002907081", "openalex:W2009279367", "openalex:W2016279534", "openalex:W2021057782", "openalex:W2028880352", "openalex:W2037592763", "openalex:W2037769964", "openalex:W2039922706", "openalex:W2044188186", "openalex:W2047409756", "openalex:W2052685640", "openalex:W2055789905", "openalex:W2063032535", "openalex:W2071573750", "openalex:W2074200738", "openalex:W2080275653", "openalex:W2097516516", "openalex:W2099097080", "openalex:W2105321763", "openalex:W2114900706", "openalex:W2122458046", "openalex:W2125663122", "openalex:W2131383911", "openalex:W2131869707", "openalex:W2133282234", "openalex:W2141442097", "openalex:W2146648176", "openalex:W2153791616", "openalex:W2156183867", "openalex:W2158935941", "openalex:W2164096899", "openalex:W2185556359", "openalex:W2216829287", "openalex:W2218005935", "openalex:W2286353276", "openalex:W2286655885", "openalex:W2410837675", "openalex:W2461939826", "openalex:W2493894436", "openalex:W2552810632", "openalex:W2558639399", "openalex:W2601234273", "openalex:W2768397541", "openalex:W2783143438", "openalex:W2783657280", "openalex:W2805651797", "openalex:W2840090792", "openalex:W2896037961", "openalex:W2908555537", "openalex:W2936386944", "openalex:W2947609478", "openalex:W2951666363", "openalex:W2952112843", "openalex:W2980778636", "openalex:W2988114478", "openalex:W2993206637", "openalex:W3005868053", "openalex:W3023671316", "openalex:W3033652112", "openalex:W3034589811", "openalex:W3081171255", "openalex:W3081516821", "openalex:W3103782180", "openalex:W3108742966", "openalex:W3111429792", "openalex:W3113133049", "openalex:W3116573416", "openalex:W3123819033", "openalex:W3158145963", "openalex:W3175106345", "openalex:W3214166545", "openalex:W4200582713", "openalex:W4205323948", "openalex:W4210365025", "openalex:W4210749031", "openalex:W4213150941", "openalex:W4220746083", "openalex:W4220781249", "openalex:W4225479391", "openalex:W4231327205", "openalex:W4232897512", "openalex:W4233047529", "openalex:W4234344480", "openalex:W4236253532", "openalex:W4237372571", "openalex:W4241744845", "openalex:W4241953145", "openalex:W4241976975", "openalex:W4255012397", "openalex:W4256505915", "openalex:W4284967789", "openalex:W4285206499", "openalex:W4285299502", "openalex:W4309912656", "openalex:W4311899085", "openalex:W4388252848", "openalex:W6626337476", "openalex:W6633592586", "openalex:W6666395383", "openalex:W6748174663", "openalex:W6822201530"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "The Problem of Meaning: The Free Energy Principle and Artificial Agency", "abstract": "Biological agents can act in ways that express a sensitivity to context-dependent relevance. So far it has proven difficult to engineer this capacity for context-dependent sensitivity to relevance in artificial agents. We give this problem the label the “problem of meaning”. The problem of meaning could be circumvented if artificial intelligence researchers were to design agents based on the assumption of the continuity of life and mind. In this paper, we focus on the proposal made by enactive cognitive scientists to design artificial agents that possess sensorimotor autonomy—stable, self-sustaining patterns of sensorimotor interaction that can ground values, norms and goals necessary for encountering a meaningful environment. More specifically, we consider whether the Free Energy Principle (FEP) can provide formal tools for modeling sensorimotor autonomy. There is currently no consensus on how to understand the relationship between enactive cognitive science and the FEP. However, a number of recent papers have argued that the two frameworks are fundamentally incompatible. Some argue that biological systems exhibit historical path-dependent learning that is absent from systems that minimize free energy. Others have argued that a free energy minimizing system would fail to satisfy a key condition for sensorimotor agency referred to as “interactional asymmetry”. These critics question the claim we defend in this paper that the FEP can be used to formally model autonomy and adaptivity. We will argue it is too soon to conclude that the two frameworks are incompatible. There are undeniable conceptual differences between the two frameworks but in our view each has something important and necessary to offer. The FEP needs enactive cognitive science for the solution it provides to the problem of meaning. Enactive cognitive science needs the FEP to formally model the properties it argues to be constitutive of agency. Our conclusion will be that active inference models based on the FEP provides a way by which scientists can think about how to address the problems of engineering autonomy and adaptivity in artificial agents in formal terms. In the end engaging more closely with this formalism and its further developments will benefit those working within the enactive framework.", "authors": [{"name": "Julian Kiverstein", "affiliation": "Academic Medical Center", "orcid": "0000-0003-3428-8367"}, {"name": "Michael D.

{"title": "Active Inference, Bayesian Optimal Design, and Expected Utility", "abstract": "Active inference, a corollary of the free energy principle, is a formal way of describing the behavior of certain kinds of random dynamical systems that have the appearance of sentience. In this chapter, we describe how active inference combines Bayesian decision theory and optimal Bayesian design principles under a single imperative to minimize expected free energy. It is this aspect of active inference that allows for the natural emergence of information-seeking behavior. When removing prior outcomes preferences from expected free energy, active inference reduces to optimal Bayesian design (i.e., information gain maximization). Conversely, active inference reduces to Bayesian decision theory in the absence of ambiguity and relative risk (i.e., expected utility maximization). Using these limiting cases, we illustrate how behaviors differ when agents select actions that optimize expected utility, expected information gain, and expected free energy. Our T-maze simulations show optimizing expected free energy produces goal-directed information-seeking behavior while optimizing expected utility induces purely exploitive behavior, and maximizing information gain engenders intrinsically motivated behavior.", "authors": [{"name": "Noor Sajid", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0003-1904-2887"}, {"name": "Lancelot Da Costa", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0003-0126-4588"}, {"name": "Thomas Parr", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0001-5108-5743"}, {"name": "Karl Friston", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0001-7984-8909"}], "year": 2022, "doi": "10.1017/9781009026949.007", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W3207389317", "venue": "Cambridge University Press eBooks", "citation_count": 11, "references": ["openalex:W81409850", "openalex:W172298727", "openalex:W1515851193", "openalex:W1550989509", "openalex:W1597472704", "openalex:W1720321157", "openalex:W1863227302", "openalex:W1988520084", "openalex:W2001289544", "openalex:W2013830186", "openalex:W2014018052", "openalex:W2017588143", "openalex:W2018044188", "openalex:W2032558547", "openalex:W2032659413", "openalex:W2039546655", "openalex:W2054698589", "openalex:W2059320470", "openalex:W2061868368", "openalex:W2076580309", "openalex:W2082304159", "openalex:W2085754318", "openalex:W2092262344", "openalex:W2094342172", "openalex:W2094740164", "openalex:W2108114251", "openalex:W2115979064", "openalex:W2123611655", "openalex:W2130195834", "openalex:W2133469585", "openalex:W2144846366", "openalex:W2148764920", "openalex:W2155772159", "openalex:W2156195892", "openalex:W2172463260", "openalex:W2188721763", "openalex:W2225156818", "openalex:W2310516540", "openalex:W2329323183", "openalex:W2408670836", "openalex:W2416513663", "openalex:W2417786368", "openalex:W2424475825", "openalex:W2463330366", "openalex:W2552810632", "openalex:W2606488938", "openalex:W2614839826", "openalex:W2623066203", "openalex:W2731829640", "openalex:W2743911451", "openalex:W2781668895", "openalex:W2796971335", "openalex:W2875797025", "openalex:W2892266804", "openalex:W2899205164", "openalex:W2902847783", "openalex:W2918957485", "openalex:W2928639725", "openalex:W2949279943", "openalex:W2950513636", "openalex:W2954626430", "openalex:W2963007936", "openalex:W2963276097", "openalex:W2963373084", "openalex:W2963523627", "openalex:W2963639957", "openalex:W2976973594", "openalex:W2980555752", "openalex:W2996530576", "openalex:W3001808890", "openalex:W3003886363", "openalex:W3009714751", "openalex:W3011313101", "openalex:W3011865677", "openalex:W3017237277", "openalex:W3017990858", "openalex:W3033115783", "openalex:W3033196763", "openalex:W3042228302", "openalex:W3083918609", "openalex:W3084523811", "openalex:W3095485376", "openalex:W3101380508", "openalex:W3118752252", "openalex:W3118769118", "openalex:W3121033252", "openalex:W3123982675", "openalex:W3201689285", "openalex:W4213348475", "openalex:W4214717370", "openalex:W4300031234", "openalex:W6635751725", "openalex:W6639133134", "openalex:W6654769447", "openalex:W6676576766", "openalex:W6713989974", "openalex:W6716474083", "openalex:W6752799821"], "publication_date": null}

The FFG framework provides both an insightful representation of the probabilistic model and a biologically plausible inference scheme that, in principle, can be automatically executed in a computer simulation.

{"title": "Control Flow in Active Inference Systems—Part II: Tensor Networks as General Models of Control Flow", "abstract": "Living systems face both environmental complexity and limited access to free-energy resources. Survival under these conditions requires a control system that can activate, or deploy, available perception and action resources in a context specific way. In Part I, we introduced the free-energy principle (FEP) and the idea of active inference as Bayesian prediction-error minimization, and show how the control problem arises in active inference systems. We then review classical and quantum formulations of the FEP, with the former being the classical limit of the latter. In this accompanying Part II, we show that when systems are described as executing active inference driven by the FEP, their control flow systems can always be represented as tensor networks (TNs). We show how TNs as control systems can be implemented within the general framework of quantum topological neural networks, and discuss the implications of these results for modeling biological systems at multiple scales.", "authors": [{"name": "Chris Fields", "affiliation": "Tufts University", "orcid": "0000-0002-4812-0744"}, {"name": "Filippo Fabrocini", "affiliation": "National Research Council", "orcid": "0000-0002-6972-1020"}, {"name": "Karl Friston", "affiliation": "VERSES (United States)", "orcid": "0000-0001-7984-8909"}, {"name": "James F.

{"title": "Active inference models do not contradict folk psychology", "abstract": "Active inference offers a unified theory of perception, learning, and decision-making at computational and neural levels of description. In this article, we address the worry that active inference may be in tension with folk psychology because it does not include terms for desires (or other conative constructs) at the mathematical level of description. To resolve this concern, we first provide a brief review of the historical progression from predictive coding to active inference, enabling us to distinguish between active inference formulations of motor control (which need not have desires under folk psychology) and active inference formulations of decision processes (which do have desires within folk psychology). We then show that, despite a superficial tension when viewed at the mathematical level, the active inference formalism contains terms that are readily identifiable as encoding both the objects of desire and the strength of desire at the psychological level. We demonstrate this with simple simulations of an active inference agent motivated to leave a dark room for different reasons. Despite their consistency, we further show how active inference may increase the granularity of folk-psychological descriptions by highlighting distinctions between drives to seek information vs. reward – and how it may also offer more precise, quantitative folk-psychological predictions.

{"title": "Empirical translation process research", "abstract": "Abstract Over the last four decades, considerable efforts have been devoted to the modeling and evaluation of human translation processes. This article takes a closer look at the evolution of empirical Translation Process Research (TPR) within the CRITT TPR-DB tradition. It contends that human translation unfolds on various processing levels and puts forth the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference (AIF) as a promising framework for modeling these intricately embedded processes in a mathematically rigorous framework. The article introduces innovative methods for quantifying fundamental concepts of Relevance Theory (relevance, s-mode, and i-mode translation) and establishes their connection with the Monitor Model, framing relevance maximization as a special case of free energy minimization. The framework presents exciting prospects for future research in predictive TPR, promising to enhance our understanding of human translation processes and contributing significantly to the broader field of translation studies and cognitive sciences in general.", "authors": [{"name": "Michaël Carl", "affiliation": "Kent State University", "orcid": "0000-0002-2815-0292"}], "year": 2023, "doi": "10.1075/tcb.00088.car", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W4392567844", "venue": "Translation Cognition & Behavior", "citation_count": 20, "references": ["openalex:W610714301", "openalex:W652095014", "openalex:W1193957902", "openalex:W1984506211", "openalex:W2013167616", "openalex:W2071994981", "openalex:W2097297491", "openalex:W2106753270", "openalex:W2126532145", "openalex:W2137145004", "openalex:W2148764920", "openalex:W2157376352", "openalex:W2163423754", "openalex:W2185067744", "openalex:W2246764633", "openalex:W2298914433", "openalex:W2342971606", "openalex:W2502455683", "openalex:W2514523862", "openalex:W2533787903", "openalex:W2534098824", "openalex:W2547428220", "openalex:W2552810632", "openalex:W2588490876", "openalex:W2588770910", "openalex:W2785250782", "openalex:W2806744336", "openalex:W2898503892", "openalex:W2915955079", "openalex:W2945850440", "openalex:W2946012205", "openalex:W2969932942", "openalex:W2971876228", "openalex:W2983252438", "openalex:W3032984186", "openalex:W3033163101", "openalex:W3111275427", "openalex:W3184844064", "openalex:W3213206823", "openalex:W4200213006", "openalex:W4205959421", "openalex:W4212993294", "openalex:W4226400653", "openalex:W4236624681", "openalex:W4238310222", "openalex:W4240553276", "openalex:W4289102285", "openalex:W4366267488", "openalex:W4380486113", "openalex:W4385788024", "openalex:W4386892802", "openalex:W6601168028", "openalex:W6633271967", "openalex:W6680931640", "openalex:W6691700813", "openalex:W6748147209", "openalex:W6807038783", "openalex:W6941243002", "openalex:W6941376446", "openalex:W6941583896"], "publication_date": null}

{"title": "Bayesian policy selection using active inference", "abstract": "Learning to take actions based on observations is a core requirement for artificial agents to be able to be successful and robust at their task. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a well-known technique for learning such policies. However, current RL algorithms often have to deal with reward shaping, have difficulties generalizing to other environments and are most often sample inefficient. In this paper, we explore active inference and the free energy principle, a normative theory from neuroscience that explains how self-organizing biological systems operate by maintaining a model of the world and casting action selection as an inference problem. We apply this concept to a typical problem known to the RL community, the mountain car problem, and show how active inference encompasses both RL and learning from demonstrations.", "authors": [{"name": "Ozan Çatal", "affiliation": "Ghent University Hospital", "orcid": "0000-0002-0216-7918"}, {"name": "Johannes Nauta", "affiliation": "Ghent University Hospital", "orcid": "0000-0002-5859-2729"}, {"name": "Tim Verbelen", "affiliation": "Ghent University Hospital", "orcid": "0000-0003-2731-7262"}, {"name": "Pieter Simoens", "affiliation": "Ghent University Hospital", "orcid": "0000-0002-9569-9373"}, {"name": "Bart Dhoedt", "affiliation": "Ghent University Hospital", "orcid": "0000-0002-7271-7479"}], "year": 2019, "doi": null, "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W2968268642", "venue": "Ghent University Academic Bibliography (Ghent University)", "citation_count": 9, "references": [], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Natural language syntax complies with the free-energy principle", "abstract": "Natural language syntax yields an unbounded array of hierarchically structured expressions. We claim that these are used in the service of active inference in accord with the free-energy principle (FEP). While conceptual advances alongside modelling and simulation work have attempted to connect speech segmentation and linguistic communication with the FEP, we extend this program to the underlying computations responsible for generating syntactic objects. We argue that recently proposed principles of economy in language design—such as “minimal search” criteria from theoretical syntax—adhere to the FEP. This affords a greater degree of explanatory power to the FEP—with respect to higher language functions—and offers linguistics a grounding in first principles with respect to computability. While we mostly focus on building new principled conceptual relations between syntax and the FEP, we also show through a sample of preliminary examples how both tree-geometric depth and a Kolmogorov complexity estimate (recruiting a Lempel–Ziv compression algorithm) can be used to accurately predict legal operations on syntactic workspaces, directly in line with formulations of variational free energy minimization. This is used to motivate a general principle of language design that we term Turing–Chomsky Compression (TCC). We use TCC to align concerns of linguists with the normative account of self-organization furnished by the FEP, by marshalling evidence from theoretical linguistics and psycholinguistics to ground core principles of efficient syntactic computation within active inference.", "authors": [{"name": "Elliot Murphy", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "E.

{"title": "Leading or Following? Dyadic Robot Imitative Interaction Using the Active Inference Framework", "abstract": "This study investigated how social interaction among robotic agents changes dynamically depending on the individual belief of action intention. In a set of simulation studies, we examine dyadic imitative interactions of robots using a variational recurrent neural network model. The model is based on the free energy principle such that a pair of interacting robots find themselves in a loop, attempting to predict and infer each other's actions using active inference. We examined how regulating the complexity term to minimize free energy determines the dynamic characteristics of networks and interactions. When one robot trained with tighter regulation and another trained with looser regulation interact, the latter tends to lead the interaction by exerting stronger action intention, while the former tends to follow by adapting to its observations. The study confirms that the dyadic imitative interaction becomes successful by achieving a high synchronization rate when a leader and a follower are determined by developing action intentions with strong belief and weak belief, respectively.", "authors": [{"name": "Nadine Wirkuttis", "affiliation": "Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University", "orcid": null}, {"name": "Jun Tani", "affiliation": "Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University", "orcid": "0000-0002-9131-9206"}], "year": 2021, "doi": "10.1109/lra.2021.3090015", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W3179281125", "venue": "IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters", "citation_count": 13, "references": ["openalex:W1986535023", "openalex:W2016740912", "openalex:W2028418738", "openalex:W2045317647", "openalex:W2103460252", "openalex:W2111947800", "openalex:W2120591602", "openalex:W2120886575", "openalex:W2127958135", "openalex:W2150272875", "openalex:W2345211079", "openalex:W2525228457", "openalex:W2541661271", "openalex:W2766736793", "openalex:W2791067024", "openalex:W2801487100", "openalex:W2959105467", "openalex:W2974745023", "openalex:W3038427506", "openalex:W3048438965", "openalex:W3099235375", "openalex:W6617744952", "openalex:W6640963894", "openalex:W6681078360", "openalex:W6685623099", "openalex:W6769981630", "openalex:W6781466806", "openalex:W7024454421"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Cooperation and Social Rules Emerging From the Principle of Surprise Minimization", "abstract": "The surprise minimization principle has been applied to explain various cognitive processes in humans. Originally describing perceptual and active inference, the framework has been applied to different types of decision making including long-term policies, utility maximization and exploration. This analysis extends the application of surprise minimization (also known as free energy principle) to a multi-agent setup and shows how it can explain the emergence of social rules and cooperation. We further show that in social decision-making and political policy design, surprise minimization is superior in many aspects to the classical approach of maximizing utility. Surprise minimization shows directly what value freedom of choice can have for social agents and why, depending on the context, they enter into cooperation, agree on social rules, or do nothing of the kind.", "authors": [{"name": "Mattis Hartwig", "affiliation": "University of Lübeck", "orcid": "0000-0002-1507-7647"}, {"name": "Achim Peters", "affiliation": "University of Lübeck", "orcid": "0000-0002-9944-7536"}], "year": 2021, "doi": "10.3389/fpsyg.2020.606174", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W3125311049", "venue": "Frontiers in Psychology", "citation_count": 11, "references": ["openalex:W196835504", "openalex:W847738030", "openalex:W1620203002", "openalex:W1659864209", "openalex:W1957007052", "openalex:W1968159705", "openalex:W1975847405", "openalex:W1978549608", "openalex:W1981378561", "openalex:W1990288127", "openalex:W1992994192", "openalex:W1994341528", "openalex:W1995810302", "openalex:W1997844067", "openalex:W2001896030", "openalex:W2003709008", "openalex:W2008950282", "openalex:W2014114527", "openalex:W2021186710", "openalex:W2025130480", "openalex:W2029232177", "openalex:W2033422410", "openalex:W2048847102", "openalex:W2057509043", "openalex:W2070684401", "openalex:W2073820635", "openalex:W2081119206", "openalex:W2081357085", "openalex:W2083211140", "openalex:W2084621368", "openalex:W2085989895", "openalex:W2086815116", "openalex:W2088381623", "openalex:W2088443095", "openalex:W2093466600", "openalex:W2098580305", "openalex:W2101632475", "openalex:W2101809190", "openalex:W2102178526", "openalex:W2108456626", "openalex:W2115095583", "openalex:W2116429669", "openalex:W2119885245", "openalex:W2120406225", "openalex:W2123429050", "openalex:W2123677515", "openalex:W2124615816", "openalex:W2127958135", "openalex:W2128707505", "openalex:W2130434337", "openalex:W2130526861", "openalex:W2131416538", "openalex:W2138497717", "openalex:W2142106331", "openalex:W2148764920", "openalex:W2150169347", "openalex:W2150258126", "openalex:W2157376352", "openalex:W2157643754", "openalex:W2157754891", "openalex:W2159594385", "openalex:W2166771493", "openalex:W2167062553", "openalex:W2231965555", "openalex:W2246577427", "openalex:W2411921399", "openalex:W2415954501", "openalex:W2523914621", "openalex:W2618517468", "openalex:W2735601643", "openalex:W2754844655", "openalex:W2783327969", "openalex:W2792104170", "openalex:W2795191834", "openalex:W2946078312", "openalex:W2996530576", "openalex:W3004750507", "openalex:W3024180373", "openalex:W3100477352", "openalex:W3123765556", "openalex:W4230900352", "openalex:W4241976975", "openalex:W4247883378", "openalex:W6749332629"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Active Inference for Autonomous Decision-Making with Contextual Multi-Armed Bandits", "abstract": "In autonomous robotic decision-making under uncertainty, the tradeoff between exploitation and exploration of available options must be considered. If secondary information associated with options can be utilized, such decision-making problems can often be formulated as contextual multi-armed bandits (CMABs). In this study, we apply active inference, which has been actively studied in the field of neuroscience in recent years, as an alternative action selection strategy for CMABs. Unlike conventional action selection strategies, it is possible to rigorously evaluate the uncertainty of each option when calculating the expected free energy (EFE) associated with the decision agent's probabilistic model, as derived from the free-energy principle. We specifically address the case where a categorical observation likelihood function is used, such that EFE values are analytically intractable. We introduce new approximation methods for computing the EFE based on variational and Laplace approximations. Extensive simulation study results demonstrate that, compared to other strategies, active inference generally requires far fewer iterations to identify optimal options and generally achieves superior cumulative regret, for relatively low extra computational cost.", "authors": [{"name": "Shohei Wakayama", "affiliation": "University of Colorado Boulder", "orcid": "0009-0009-1058-8366"}, {"name": "Nisar Ahmed", "affiliation": "University of Colorado Boulder", "orcid": "0000-0002-7555-5671"}], "year": 2023, "doi": "10.1109/icra48891.2023.10160593", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W4383108752", "venue": null, "citation_count": 12, "references": ["openalex:W170770739", "openalex:W1506806321", "openalex:W1544426622", "openalex:W1979549523", "openalex:W1990096926", "openalex:W1997568160", "openalex:W2014158652", "openalex:W2039522160", "openalex:W2059320470", "openalex:W2076337359", "openalex:W2096375888", "openalex:W2112420033", "openalex:W2116067849", "openalex:W2148764920", "openalex:W2168359464", "openalex:W2168405694", "openalex:W2576938664", "openalex:W2584182651", "openalex:W2781668895", "openalex:W2914741383", "openalex:W2962849870", "openalex:W2970804664", "openalex:W3083184774", "openalex:W3123802877", "openalex:W3126077502", "openalex:W3205866499", "openalex:W4200634454", "openalex:W4206513913", "openalex:W4300035398", "openalex:W4383108752", "openalex:W6632462264", "openalex:W6802597814", "openalex:W6805513666", "openalex:W6843085900"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Active Inference and Intentional Behavior", "abstract": "Abstract Recent advances in theoretical biology suggest that key definitions of basal cognition and sentient behavior may arise as emergent properties of in vitro cell cultures and neuronal networks. Such neuronal networks reorganize activity to demonstrate structured behaviors when embodied in structured information landscapes. In this article, we characterize this kind of self-organization through the lens of the free energy principle, that is, as self-evidencing. We do this by first discussing the definitions of reactive and sentient behavior in the setting of active inference, which describes the behavior of agents that model the consequences of their actions. We then introduce a formal account of intentional behavior that describes agents as driven by a preferred end point or goal in latent state-spaces. We then investigate these forms of (reactive, sentient, and intentional) behavior using simulations. First, we simulate the in vitro experiments, in which neuronal cultures modulated activity to improve gameplay in a simplified version of Pong by implementing nested, free energy minimizing processes. The simulations are then used to deconstruct the ensuing predictive behavior, leading to the distinction between merely reactive, sentient, and intentional behavior with the latter formalized in terms of inductive inference. This distinction is further studied using simple machine learning benchmarks (navigation in a grid world and the Tower of Hanoi problem) that show how quickly and efficiently adaptive behavior emerges under an inductive form of active inference.", "authors": [{"name": "Karl Friston", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0001-7984-8909"}, {"name": "Tommaso Salvatori", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0002-7254-9882"}, {"name": "Takuya Isomura", "affiliation": "RIKEN Center for Brain Science", "orcid": "0000-0003-2960-4919"}, {"name": "Alexander Tschantz", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0002-9751-5929"}, {"name": "Alex Kiefer", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0003-1957-797X"}, {"name": "Tim Verbelen", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0003-2731-7262"}, {"name": "Magnus Koudahl", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0003-3411-5036"}, {"name": "Aswin Paul", "affiliation": "IITB-Monash Research Academy", "orcid": "0000-0002-8559-4711"}, {"name": "Thomas Parr", "affiliation": "University of Oxford", "orcid": "0000-0001-5108-5743"}, {"name": "Adeel Razi", "affiliation": "Canadian Institute for Advanced Research", "orcid": "0000-0002-0779-9439"}, {"name": "Brett J.

{"title": "Generalized Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (G-SLAM) as unification framework for natural and artificial intelligences: towards reverse engineering the hippocampal/entorhinal system and principles of high-level cognition", "abstract": "Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) represents a fundamental problem for autonomous embodied systems, for which the hippocampal/entorhinal system (H/E-S) has been optimized over the course of evolution. We have developed a biologically-inspired SLAM architecture based on latent variable generative modeling within the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference (FEP-AI) framework, which affords flexible navigation and planning in mobile robots. We have primarily focused on attempting to reverse engineer H/E-S “design” properties, but here we consider ways in which SLAM principles from robotics may help us better understand nervous systems and emergent minds. After reviewing LatentSLAM and notable features of this control architecture, we consider how the H/E-S may realize these functional properties not only for physical navigation, but also with respect to high-level cognition understood as generalized simultaneous localization and mapping (G-SLAM). We focus on loop-closure, graph-relaxation, and node duplication as particularly impactful architectural features, suggesting these computational phenomena may contribute to understanding cognitive insight (as proto-causal-inference), accommodation (as integration into existing schemas), and assimilation (as category formation). All these operations can similarly be describable in terms of structure/category learning on multiple levels of abstraction. However, here we adopt an ecological rationality perspective, framing H/E-S functions as orchestrating SLAM processes within both concrete and abstract hypothesis spaces. In this navigation/search process, adaptive cognitive equilibration between assimilation and accommodation involves balancing tradeoffs between exploration and exploitation; this dynamic equilibrium may be near optimally realized in FEP-AI, wherein control systems governed by expected free energy objective functions naturally balance model simplicity and accuracy. With respect to structure learning, such a balance would involve constructing models and categories that are neither too inclusive nor exclusive. We propose these (generalized) SLAM phenomena may represent some of the most impactful sources of variation in cognition both within and between individuals, suggesting that modulators of H/E-S functioning may potentially illuminate their adaptive significances as fundamental cybernetic control parameters. Finally, we discuss how understanding H/E-S contributions to G-SLAM may provide a unifying framework for high-level cognition and its potential realization in artificial intelligences.", "authors":

{"title": "Integrated world modeling theory expanded: Implications for the future of consciousness", "abstract": "Integrated world modeling theory (IWMT) is a synthetic theory of consciousness that uses the free energy principle and active inference (FEP-AI) framework to combine insights from integrated information theory (IIT) and global neuronal workspace theory (GNWT). Here, I first review philosophical principles and neural systems contributing to IWMT’s integrative perspective. I then go on to describe predictive processing models of brains and their connections to machine learning architectures, with particular emphasis on autoencoders (perceptual and active inference), turbo-codes (establishment of shared latent spaces for multi-modal integration and inferential synergy), and graph neural networks (spatial and somatic modeling and control). Future directions for IIT and GNWT are considered by exploring ways in which modules and workspaces may be evaluated as both complexes of integrated information and arenas for iterated Bayesian model selection. Based on these considerations, I suggest novel ways in which integrated information might be estimated using concepts from probabilistic graphical models, flow networks, and game theory. Mechanistic and computational principles are also considered with respect to the ongoing debate between IIT and GNWT regarding the physical substrates of different kinds of conscious and unconscious phenomena. I further explore how these ideas might relate to the “Bayesian blur problem,” or how it is that a seemingly discrete experience can be generated from probabilistic modeling, with some consideration of analogies from quantum mechanics as potentially revealing different varieties of inferential dynamics. I go on to describe potential means of addressing critiques of causal structure theories based on network unfolding, and the seeming absurdity of conscious expander graphs (without cybernetic symbol grounding). Finally, I discuss future directions for work centered on attentional selection and the evolutionary origins of consciousness as facilitated “unlimited associative learning.” While not quite solving the Hard problem, this article expands on IWMT as a unifying model of consciousness and the potential future evolution of minds.", "authors": [{"name": "Adam Safron", "affiliation": "Johns Hopkins

{"title": "Models of the Translation Process and the Free Energy Principle", "abstract": "Translation process research (TPR) has generated a large number of models that aim at explaining human translation processes. In this paper, I suggest an extension of the monitor model to incorporate aspects of relevance theory (RT) and to adopt the free energy principle (FEP) as a generative model to elucidate translational behaviour. The FEP—and its corollary, active inference—provide a general, mathematical framework to explain how organisms resist entropic erosion so as to remain within their phenotypic bounds. It posits that organisms reduce the gap between their expectations and observations by minimising a quantity called free energy. I map these concepts on the translation process and exemplify them with behavioural data. The analysis is based on the notion of translation units (TUs) which exhibit observable traces of the translator’s epistemic and pragmatic engagement with their translation environment, (i.e., the text) that can be measured in terms of translation effort and effects. Sequences of TUs cluster into translation states (steady state, orientation, and hesitation). Drawing on active inference, sequences of translation states combine into translation policies that reduce expected free energy. I show how the notion of free energy is compatible with the concept of relevance, as developed in RT, and how essential concepts of the monitor model and RT can be formalised as deep temporal generative models that can be interpreted under a representationalist view, but also support a non-representationalist account.", "authors": [{"name": "Michaël Carl", "affiliation": "Kent State University", "orcid": "0000-0002-2815-0292"}], "year": 2023, "doi": "10.3390/e25060928", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W4380486113", "venue": "Entropy", "citation_count": 8, "references": ["openalex:W622346006", "openalex:W1597330426", "openalex:W1971487364", "openalex:W1975495838", "openalex:W2011555849", "openalex:W2013167616", "openalex:W2021853567", "openalex:W2026913377", "openalex:W2038561893", "openalex:W2064106842", "openalex:W2068004209", "openalex:W2071994981", "openalex:W2072689193", "openalex:W2092664106", "openalex:W2097297491", "openalex:W2115460576", "openalex:W2125615411", "openalex:W2125732627", "openalex:W2126532145", "openalex:W2148764920", "openalex:W2157376352", "openalex:W2250390011", "openalex:W2534098824", "openalex:W2743911451", "openalex:W2898503892", "openalex:W2901248493", "openalex:W2946012205", "openalex:W2947917023", "openalex:W2969932942", "openalex:W2983252438", "openalex:W3161874663", "openalex:W3163625492", "openalex:W3184844064", "openalex:W4226023986", "openalex:W4226400653", "openalex:W4229972507", "openalex:W4238675551", "openalex:W4248169967", "openalex:W4248348427", "openalex:W4366267488", "openalex:W4396603873", "openalex:W6614874179", "openalex:W6667490848", "openalex:W6755266383", "openalex:W6756291390", "openalex:W6763316275", "openalex:W6941376446", "openalex:W6982153354", "openalex:W7064069164"], "publication_date": null}

It rehearses the key steps using standard results from statistical physics. These steps entail (i) establishing a particular partition of states based upon conditional independencies that inherit from sparsely coupled dynamics, (ii) unpacking the implications of this partition in terms of Bayesian inference and (iii) describing the paths of particular states with a variational principle of least action. Teleologically, the free energy principle offers a normative account of self-organisation in terms of optimal Bayesian design and decision-making, in the sense of maximising marginal likelihood or Bayesian model evidence. In summary, starting from a description of the world in terms of random dynamical systems, we end up with a description of self-organisation as sentient behaviour that can be interpreted as self-evidencing; namely, self-assembly, autopoiesis or active inference.", "authors": [{"name": "Karl Friston", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0001-7984-8909"}, {"name": "Lancelot Da Costa", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0003-0126-4588"}, {"name": "Noor Sajid", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0003-1904-2887"}, {"name": "Conor Heins", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0002-5884-7728"}, {"name": "Kai Ueltzhöffer", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0002-0507-7598"}, {"name": "Grigorios A.

This article is a review of ongoing research focusing on model dynamics associated with human self-consciousness. It introduces the free energy principle and active inference in terms of Bayesian theory and predictive coding, and then discusses how directed inquiry employing analogous models may bring us closer to representing the sense of self in cognitive neurorobots. The first section quickly locates cognitive neurorobotics in the broad field of computational cognitive modeling. The second section introduces principles according to which cognition may be formalized, and reviews cognitive neurorobotics experiments employing such formalizations. The third section interprets the results of these and other experiments in the context of different senses of self, both “minimal” and “narrative” self. The fourth section considers model validity and discusses what we may expect ongoing cognitive neurorobotics studies to contribute to scientific explanation of cognitive phenomena including the senses of minimal and narrative self.", "authors": [{"name": "Jun Tani", "affiliation": "Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University", "orcid": "0000-0002-9131-9206"}, {"name": "Jeffrey White", "affiliation": "Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University", "orcid": null}], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1177/1059712320962158", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W3092075271", "venue": "Adaptive Behavior", "citation_count": 21, "references": ["openalex:W1497244971", "openalex:W1508653503", "openalex:W1569071533", "openalex:W1594399642", "openalex:W1608391772", "openalex:W1707571044", "openalex:W1916207017", "openalex:W1950864686", "openalex:W1966089223", "openalex:W1967273673", "openalex:W1968589664", "openalex:W1968940530", "openalex:W1975147363", "openalex:W1977576450", "openalex:W1980428832", "openalex:W1986752369", "openalex:W1989974095", "openalex:W1999006084", "openalex:W2016081151", "openalex:W2028418738", "openalex:W2045317647", "openalex:W2047004412", "openalex:W2066960179", "openalex:W2070020547", "openalex:W2071906671", "openalex:W2075179456", "openalex:W2081817157", "openalex:W2082285558", "openalex:W2083871567", "openalex:W2085848279", "openalex:W2087946919", "openalex:W2089029564", "openalex:W2090857737", "openalex:W2099359781", "openalex:W2101524054", "openalex:W2107019937", "openalex:W2108984806", "openalex:W2110525007", "openalex:W2111947800", "openalex:W2113266872", "openalex:W2114414717", "openalex:W2115460576", "openalex:W2118555141", "openalex:W2119885245", "openalex:W2126233790", "openalex:W2127958135", "openalex:W2143623899", "openalex:W2147445724", "openalex:W2147677349", "openalex:W2148544865", "openalex:W2150355110", "openalex:W2154409655", "openalex:W2155352776", "openalex:W2159980186", "openalex:W2168342951", "openalex:W2274733288", "openalex:W2276275925", "openalex:W2345211079", "openalex:W2397253692", "openalex:W2404058514", "openalex:W2466040151", "openalex:W2553496799", "openalex:W2558206955", "openalex:W2581251857", "openalex:W2591458607", "openalex:W2604838875", "openalex:W2770265249", "openalex:W2781668895", "openalex:W2791067024", "openalex:W2793221085", "openalex:W2801487100", "openalex:W2807882068", "openalex:W2809892310", "openalex:W2883445328", "openalex:W2884852581", "openalex:W2892301014", "openalex:W2901254592", "openalex:W2927220769", "openalex:W2948901522", "openalex:W2959105467", "openalex:W2963932186", "openalex:W2964161785", "openalex:W2974745023", "openalex:W3017990858", "openalex:W3100675524", "openalex:W3105455841", "openalex:W3110909889", "openalex:W4233071312", "openalex:W4236625020", "openalex:W4242829728", "openalex:W4246293254", "openalex:W4247883378", "openalex:W4249571709", "openalex:W4249731349", "openalex:W4256063420", "openalex:W4283834748", "openalex:W4298864296", "openalex:W4300402905"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "I like therefore I can, and I can therefore I like: the role of self-efficacy and affect in active inference of allostasis", "abstract": "Active inference (AIF) is a theory of the behavior of information-processing open dynamic systems. It describes them as generative models (GM) generating inferences on the causes of sensory input they receive from their environment. Based on these inferences, GMs generate predictions about sensory input. The discrepancy between a prediction and the actual input results in prediction error. GMs then execute action policies predicted to minimize the prediction error. The free-energy principle provides a rationale for AIF by stipulating that information-processing open systems must constantly minimize their free energy (through suppressing the cumulative prediction error) to avoid decay. The theory of homeostasis and allostasis has a similar logic. Homeostatic set points are expectations of living organisms. Discrepancies between set points and actual states generate stress. For optimal functioning, organisms avoid stress by preserving homeostasis. Theories of AIF and homeostasis have recently converged, with AIF providing a formal account for homeo- and allostasis. In this paper, we present bacterial chemotaxis as molecular AIF, where mutual constraints by extero- and interoception play an essential role in controlling bacterial behavior supporting homeostasis. Extending this insight to the brain, we propose a conceptual model of the brain homeostatic GM, in which we suggest partition of the brain GM into cognitive and physiological homeostatic GMs. We outline their mutual regulation as well as their integration based on the free-energy principle. From this analysis, affect and self-efficacy emerge as the main regulators of the cognitive homeostatic GM. We suggest fatigue and depression as target neurocognitive phenomena for studying the neural mechanisms of such regulation.", "authors": [{"name": "Valery Krupnik", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0003-1086-6716"}], "year": 2024, "doi": "10.3389/fncir.2024.1283372", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W4391108346", "venue": "Frontiers in Neural Circuits", "citation_count": 8, "references": ["openalex:W127036837", "openalex:W1418557530", "openalex:W1524895715", "openalex:W1533496174", "openalex:W1586476523", "openalex:W1620203002", "openalex:W1966233504", "openalex:W1976202125", "openalex:W1978611394", "openalex:W1978762354", "openalex:W1979732124", "openalex:W1981748148", "openalex:W1981937607", "openalex:W1994125953", "openalex:W2002907081", "openalex:W2008253528", "openalex:W2008950282", "openalex:W2011810065", "openalex:W2023864075", "openalex:W2056188866", "openalex:W2057885595", "openalex:W2064441783", "openalex:W2072975230", "openalex:W2075357094", "openalex:W2093466600", "openalex:W2096962395", "openalex:W2099000799", "openalex:W2099781923", "openalex:W2100155700", "openalex:W2109699325", "openalex:W2123651254", "openalex:W2126718722", "openalex:W2129143684", "openalex:W2134049139", "openalex:W2140526779", "openalex:W2142322930", "openalex:W2148764920", "openalex:W2157376352", "openalex:W2160195521", "openalex:W2160253279", "openalex:W2170552040", "openalex:W2172223517", "openalex:W2194932295", "openalex:W2303400061", "openalex:W2322831270", "openalex:W2486533162", "openalex:W2530226740", "openalex:W2531083186", "openalex:W2551311960", "openalex:W2552810632", "openalex:W2588980107", "openalex:W2602750951", "openalex:W2606488938", "openalex:W2606868341", "openalex:W2618517468", "openalex:W2765412958", "openalex:W2769704218", "openalex:W2769859915", "openalex:W2781668895", "openalex:W2789154098", "openalex:W2801997553", "openalex:W2810498355", "openalex:W2886812383", "openalex:W2886964648", "openalex:W2889166554", "openalex:W2905123697", "openalex:W2908555537", "openalex:W2944456797", "openalex:W2945567094", "openalex:W2951806597", "openalex:W2975167992", "openalex:W3039816366", "openalex:W3040674963", "openalex:W3048787899", "openalex:W3108742966", "openalex:W3115649676", "openalex:W3123185716", "openalex:W3161889428", "openalex:W3186993140", "openalex:W3188696947", "openalex:W3201689285", "openalex:W4211130665", "openalex:W4212971928", "openalex:W4214927613", "openalex:W4235747109", "openalex:W4241849749", "openalex:W4247883378", "openalex:W4248712191", "openalex:W4282969360", "openalex:W4292291446", "openalex:W4292808503", "openalex:W4296125873", "openalex:W4311730592", "openalex:W4324027820", "openalex:W4383265040", "openalex:W6605172867", "openalex:W6661982767"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Hyperactivity of the default mode network in schizophrenia and free energy: A dialogue between Freudian theory of psychosis and neuroscience", "abstract": "The economic conceptualization of Freudian metapsychology, based on an energetics model of the psyche's workings, offers remarkable commonalities with some recent discoveries in neuroscience, notably in the field of neuroenergetics. The pattern of cerebral activity at resting state and the identification of a default mode network (DMN), a network of areas whose activity is detectable at baseline conditions by neuroimaging techniques, offers a promising field of research in the dialogue between psychoanalysis and neuroscience. In this article we study one significant clinical application of this interdisciplinary dialogue by looking at the role of the DMN in the psychopathology of schizophrenia. Anomalies in the functioning of the DMN have been observed in schizophrenia. Studies have evidenced the existence of hyperactivity in this network in schizophrenia patients, particularly among those for whom a positive symptomatology is dominant. These data are particularly interesting when considered from the perspective of the psychoanalytic understanding of the positive symptoms of psychosis, most notably the Freudian hypothesis of delusions as an “attempt at recovery.” Combining the data from research in neuroimaging of schizophrenia patients with the Freudian hypothesis, we propose considering the hyperactivity of the DMN as a consequence of a process of massive reassociation of traces occurring in schizophrenia. This is a process that may constitute an attempt at minimizing the excess of free energy present in psychosis. Modern models of active inference and the free energy principle (FEP) may shed some light on these processes.", "authors": [{"name": "Jessica Tran The", "affiliation": "Neuropsychologie et Imagerie de la Mémoire Humaine", "orcid": "0000-0003-1093-9532"}, {"name": "Jean‐Philippe Ansermet", "affiliation": "École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne", "orcid": "0000-0002-1307-4864"}, {"name": "Pierre J.

{"title": "Generalized Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (G-SLAM) as unification framework for natural and artificial intelligences: towards reverse engineering the hippocampal/entorhinal system and principles of high-level cognition", "abstract": "Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) represents a fundamental problem for autonomous embodied systems, for which the hippocampal/entorhinal system (H/E-S) has been optimized over the course of evolution. We have developed a biologically-inspired SLAM architecture based on latent variable generative modeling within the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference (FEP-AI) framework, which affords flexible navigation and planning in mobile robots. We have primarily focused on attempting to reverse engineer H/E-S ‘design’ properties, but here we consider ways in which SLAM principles from robotics may help us better understand nervous systems and emergent minds. After reviewing LatentSLAM and notable features of this control architecture, we consider how the H/E-S may realize these functional properties not only for physical navigation, but also with respect to high-level cognition understood as generalized simultaneous localization and mapping (G-SLAM). We focus on loop-closure, graph-relaxation, and node duplication as particularly impactful architectural features, suggesting these computational phenomena may contribute to understanding cognitive insight (as proto-causal-inference), accommodation (as integration into existing schemas), and assimilation (as category formation). All these operations can similarly be describable in terms of structure/category learning on multiple levels of abstraction. However, here we adopt an ecological rationality perspective, framing H/E-S functions as orchestrating SLAM processes within both concrete and abstract hypothesis spaces. In this navigation/search process, adaptive cognitive equilibration between assimilation and accommodation involves balancing tradeoffs between exploration and exploitation; this dynamic equilibrium may be near optimally realized in FEP-AI, wherein control systems governed by expected free energy objective functions naturally balance model simplicity and accuracy. With respect to structure learning, such a balance would involve constructing models and categories that are neither too inclusive nor exclusive. We propose these (generalized) SLAM phenomena may represent some of the most impactful sources of variation in cognition both within and between individuals, suggesting that modulators of H/E-S functioning may potentially illuminate their adaptive significances as fundamental cybernetic control parameters. Finally, we discuss how understanding H/E-S contributions to G-SLAM may provide a unifying framework for high-level cognition and its potential realization in artificial intelligences.", "authors":

{"title": "A Minimal Active Inference Agent", "abstract": "Research on the so-called \"free-energy principle'' (FEP) in cognitive neuroscience is becoming increasingly high-profile. To date, introductions to this theory have proved difficult for many readers to follow, but it depends mainly upon two relatively simple ideas: firstly that normative or teleological values can be expressed as probability distributions (active inference), and secondly that approximate Bayesian reasoning can be effectively performed by gradient descent on model parameters (the free-energy principle). The notion of active inference is of great interest for a number of disciplines including cognitive science and artificial intelligence, as well as cognitive neuroscience, and deserves to be more widely known. This paper attempts to provide an accessible introduction to active inference and informational free-energy, for readers from a range of scientific backgrounds.

{"title": "Resolving uncertainty on the fly: modeling adaptive driving behavior as active inference", "abstract": "Understanding adaptive human driving behavior, in particular how drivers manage uncertainty, is of key importance for developing simulated human driver models that can be used in the evaluation and development of autonomous vehicles. However, existing traffic psychology models of adaptive driving behavior either lack computational rigor or only address specific scenarios and/or behavioral phenomena. While models developed in the fields of machine learning and robotics can effectively learn adaptive driving behavior from data, due to their black box nature, they offer little or no explanation of the mechanisms underlying the adaptive behavior. Thus, generalizable, interpretable, computational models of adaptive human driving behavior are still rare. This paper proposes such a model based on active inference, a behavioral modeling framework originating in computational neuroscience. The model offers a principled solution to how humans trade progress against caution through policy selection based on the single mandate to minimize expected free energy. This casts goal-seeking and information-seeking (uncertainty-resolving) behavior under a single objective function, allowing the model to seamlessly resolve uncertainty as a means to obtain its goals. We apply the model in two apparently disparate driving scenarios that require managing uncertainty, (1) driving past an occluding object and (2) visual time-sharing between driving and a secondary task, and show how human-like adaptive driving behavior emerges from the single principle of expected free energy minimization.", "authors": [{"name": "Johan Engström", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Ran Wei", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Anthony D.

{"title": "The dark room problem in predictive processing and active inference, a legacy of cognitivism?", "abstract": "The free energy principle describes cognitive functions such as perception, action, learning and attention in terms of surprisal minimisation. Under simplifying assumptions, agents are depicted as systems minimising a weighted sum of prediction errors encoding the mismatch between incoming sensations and an agent’s predictions about such sensations. The “dark room” is defined as a state that an agent would occupy should it only look to minimise this sum of prediction errors.&#13;\\nThis (paradoxical) state emerges as the contrast between the attempts to describe the richness of human and animal behaviour in terms of surprisal minimisation and the trivial solution of a dark room, where the complete lack of sensory stimuli would provide the easiest way to minimise prediction errors, i.e., to be in a perfectly predictable state of darkness with no incoming stimuli. Using a process theory derived from the free energy principle, active inference, we investigate with an agent-based model the meaning of the dark room problem and discuss some of its implications for natural and artificial systems. In this set up, we propose that the presence of this paradox is primarily due to the long-standing belief that agents should encode accurate world models, typical of traditional (computational) theories of cognition.", "authors": [{"name": "Manuel Baltieri", "affiliation": "University of Sussex", "orcid": "0000-0002-6086-4711"}, {"name": "Christopher L.

{"title": "Accessing Active Inference Theory through Its Implicit and Deliberative Practice in Human Organizations", "abstract": "Active inference theory (AIT) is a corollary of the free-energy principle, which formalizes cognition of living system’s autopoietic organization. AIT comprises specialist terminology and mathematics used in theoretical neurobiology. Yet, active inference is common practice in human organizations, such as private companies, public institutions, and not-for-profits. Active inference encompasses three interrelated types of actions, which are carried out to minimize uncertainty about how organizations will survive. The three types of action are updating work beliefs, shifting work attention, and/or changing how work is performed. Accordingly, an alternative starting point for grasping active inference, rather than trying to understand AIT specialist terminology and mathematics, is to reflect upon lived experience. In other words, grasping active inference through autoethnographic research. In this short communication paper, accessing AIT through autoethnography is explained in terms of active inference in existing organizational practice (implicit active inference), new organizational methodologies that are informed by AIT (deliberative active inference), and combining implicit and deliberative active inference. In addition, these autoethnographic options for grasping AIT are related to generative learning.", "authors": [{"name": "Stephen Fox", "affiliation": "VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland", "orcid": "0000-0002-3447-4832"}], "year": 2021, "doi": "10.3390/e23111521", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W3213807182", "venue": "Entropy", "citation_count": 5, "references": ["openalex:W121972638", "openalex:W165905253", "openalex:W240189501", "openalex:W2039917794", "openalex:W2115460576", "openalex:W2123308448", "openalex:W2148764920", "openalex:W2160778775", "openalex:W2173798076", "openalex:W2463330366", "openalex:W2525228457", "openalex:W2724432611", "openalex:W2745471824", "openalex:W2884852581", "openalex:W2904487358", "openalex:W2947609478", "openalex:W2989091309", "openalex:W2998890099", "openalex:W3026687585", "openalex:W3040286910", "openalex:W3120911093", "openalex:W3121884370", "openalex:W3125572562", "openalex:W3128268019", "openalex:W3198666034", "openalex:W4245098948", "openalex:W4300186150", "openalex:W4388170721", "openalex:W4401894725", "openalex:W6678756505", "openalex:W6858277306"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Natural language syntax complies with the free-energy principle", "abstract": "Natural language syntax yields an unbounded array of hierarchically structured expressions. We claim that these are used in the service of active inference in accord with the free-energy principle (FEP). While conceptual advances alongside modelling and simulation work have attempted to connect speech segmentation and linguistic communication with the FEP, we extend this program to the underlying computations responsible for generating syntactic objects. We argue that recently proposed principles of economy in language design—such as “minimal search” criteria from theoretical syntax—adhere to the FEP. This affords a greater degree of explanatory power to the FEP—with respect to higher language functions—and offers linguistics a grounding in first principles with respect to computability. We show how both tree-geometric depth and a Kolmogorov complexity estimate (recruiting a Lempel–Ziv compression algorithm) can be used to accurately predict legal operations on syntactic workspaces, directly in line with formulations of variational free energy minimization. This is used to motivate a general principle of language design that we term Turing–Chomsky Compression (TCC). We use TCC to align concerns of linguists with the normative account of self-organization furnished by the FEP, by marshalling evidence from theoretical linguistics and psycholinguistics to ground

In this paper, we integrate the imitation learning method with active inference to minimize the expected free energy under the supervision of an expert model.

{"title": "Active Inference Through Energy Minimization in Multimodal Affective Human–Robot Interaction", "abstract": "During communication, humans express their emotional states using various modalities (e.g., facial expressions and gestures), and they estimate the emotional states of others by paying attention to multimodal signals. To ensure that a communication robot with limited resources can pay attention to such multimodal signals, the main challenge involves selecting the most effective modalities among those expressed. In this study, we propose an active perception method that involves selecting the most informative modalities using a criterion based on energy minimization. This energy-based model can learn the probability of the network state using energy values, whereby a lower energy value represents a higher probability of the state. A multimodal deep belief network, which is an energy-based model, was employed to represent the relationships between the emotional states and multimodal sensory signals. Compared to other active perception methods, the proposed approach demonstrated improved accuracy using limited information in several contexts associated with affective human–robot interaction. We present the differences and advantages of our method compared to other methods through mathematical formulations using, for example, information gain as a criterion. Further, we evaluate performance of our method, as pertains to active inference, which is based on the free energy principle. Consequently, we establish that our method demonstrated superior performance in tasks associated with mutually correlated multimodal information.", "authors": [{"name": "Takato Horii", "affiliation": "Osaka University", "orcid": "0000-0001-5374-0887"}, {"name": "Yukie Nagai", "affiliation": "The University of Tokyo", "orcid": "0000-0003-4794-0940"}], "year": 2021, "doi": "10.3389/frobt.2021.684401", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W3217145890", "venue": "Frontiers in Robotics and AI", "citation_count": 8, "references": ["openalex:W1982057826", "openalex:W1989104072", "openalex:W1989823960", "openalex:W1997318488", "openalex:W2018995617", "openalex:W2041971450", "openalex:W2052685640", "openalex:W2088070713", "openalex:W2096375888", "openalex:W2100495367", "openalex:W2110683152", "openalex:W2142379211", "openalex:W2146334809", "openalex:W2148764920", "openalex:W2184188583", "openalex:W2211029476", "openalex:W2530226740", "openalex:W2531262049", "openalex:W2538626945", "openalex:W2552810632", "openalex:W2567659977", "openalex:W2573779815", "openalex:W2578725037", "openalex:W2741457819", "openalex:W2765182984", "openalex:W2791957742", "openalex:W2801586818", "openalex:W2948283202", "openalex:W2949471033", "openalex:W2992533179", "openalex:W3001808890", "openalex:W3003886363", "openalex:W3019918398", "openalex:W3035913254", "openalex:W3048438965", "openalex:W3095485376", "openalex:W3101413036", "openalex:W3118769118", "openalex:W3120701370", "openalex:W3183787066", "openalex:W4233973055", "openalex:W4287672544", "openalex:W4287826625", "openalex:W4299280181", "openalex:W6645961474", "openalex:W6680066585", "openalex:W6686207219", "openalex:W6688368446", "openalex:W6732377861", "openalex:W6745053987", "openalex:W6750449527", "openalex:W6763271673", "openalex:W6775293196", "openalex:W6779565305", "openalex:W6782448357"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Free energy and inference in living systems", "abstract": "Organisms are non-equilibrium, stationary systems self-organized via spontaneous symmetry breaking and undergoing metabolic cycles with broken detailed balance in the environment. The thermodynamic free-energy (FE) principle describes an organism’s homeostasis as the regulation of biochemical work constrained by the physical FE cost. By contrast, recent research in neuroscience and theoretical biology explains a higher organism’s homeostasis and allostasis as Bayesian inference facilitated by the informational FE. As an integrated approach to living systems, this study presents an FE minimization theory overarching the essential features of both the thermodynamic and neuroscientific FE principles. Our results reveal that the perception and action of animals result from active inference entailed by FE minimization in the brain, and the brain operates as a Schrödinger’s machine conducting the neural mechanics of minimizing sensory uncertainty. A parsimonious model suggests that the Bayesian brain develops the optimal trajectories in neural manifolds and induces a dynamic bifurcation between neural attractors in the process of active inference.", "authors": [{"name": "C.

{"title": "Exploring disturbance as a force for good in motor learning", "abstract": "Disturbance forces facilitate motor learning, but theoretical explanations for this counterintuitive phenomenon are lacking. Smooth arm movements require predictions (inference) about the force-field associated with a workspace. The Free Energy Principle (FEP) suggests that such 'active inference' is driven by 'surprise'. We used these insights to create a formal model that explains why disturbance might help learning. In two experiments, participants undertook a continuous tracking task where they learned how to move their arm in different directions through a novel 3D force field. We compared baseline performance before and after exposure to the novel field to quantify learning. In Experiment 1, the exposure phases (but not the baseline measures) were delivered under three different conditions: (i) robot haptic assistance; (ii) no guidance; (iii) robot haptic disturbance. The disturbance group showed the best learning as our model predicted. Experiment 2 further tested our FEP inspired model. Assistive and/or disturbance forces were applied as a function of performance (low surprise), and compared to a random error manipulation (high surprise). The random group showed the most improvement as predicted by the model. Thus, motor learning can be conceptualised as a process of entropy reduction. Short term motor strategies (e.g. global impedance) can mitigate unexpected perturbations, but continuous movements require active inference about external force-fields in order to create accurate internal models of the external world (motor learning). Our findings reconcile research on the relationship between noise, variability, and motor learning, and show that information is the currency of motor learning.", "authors": [{"name": "Jack Brookes", "affiliation": "University of Leeds", "orcid": "0000-0002-4600-7561"}, {"name": "Faisal Mushtaq", "affiliation": "University of Leeds", "orcid": "0000-0001-7881-1127"}, {"name": "Earle Jamieson", "affiliation": "University of Leeds", "orcid": null}, {"name": "Aaron J.

{"title": "Neural and phenotypic representation under the free-energy principle", "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to leverage the free-energy principle and its corollary process theory, active inference, to develop a generic, generalizable model of the representational capacities of living creatures; that is, a theory of phenotypic representation. Given their ubiquity, we are concerned with distributed forms of representation (e.g., population codes), whereby patterns of ensemble activity in living tissue come to represent the causes of sensory input or data. The active inference framework rests on the Markov blanket formalism, which allows us to partition systems of interest, such as biological systems, into internal states, external states, and the blanket (active and sensory) states that render internal and external states conditionally independent of each other. In this framework, the representational capacity of living creatures emerges as a consequence of their Markovian structure and nonequilibrium dynamics, which together entail a dual-aspect information geometry. This entails a modest representational capacity: internal states have an intrinsic information geometry that describes their trajectory over time in state space, as well as an extrinsic information geometry that allows internal states to encode (the parameters of) probabilistic beliefs about (fictive) external states. Building on this, we describe here how, in an automatic and emergent manner, information about stimuli can come to be encoded by groups of neurons bound by a Markov blanket; what is known as the neuronal packet hypothesis.

{"title": "Anticipatory action active inference in embodied cognitive activity", "abstract": "This paper addresses the cognitive basis of anticipatory action. It does so by taking up what we call the acuity problem: the problem of explaining how skilled action seems, on the one hand, to be executed and unfold automatically and reflexively and, on the other hand, to involve anticipation of context-sensitive and constantly changing conditions in performance. The acuity problem invites two contemporary forms of reply, which we label non-inferential enactivism and Helmholtzian inference, respectively. We advance a third avenue for replying to the acuity problem, which takes active inference under the free energy principle as its theoretical starting point. This third way is, we contend, preferable to the other two across a number of important theoretical dimensions.", "authors": [{"name": "Ian H.

{"title": "Unfulfilled prophecies in sport performance: Active inference and the choking effect", "abstract": "2020, Imprint Academic. All rights reserved. Choking effect (choke) is the tendency of expert athletes to underperform in high-stakes situations. We propose an account of choke based on active inference - a corollary of the free energy principle in cognitive neuroscience. The active inference scheme can explain certain forms of sensorimotor skills disruption in terms of precision-modulated imbalance between sensory input and higher-level predictions. This model predicts that choke arises when the system fails to attenuate the error signal generated by proprioceptive sensory input. We aim to expand the previous formulations of this model to integrate the contribution of other causal factors, such as confidence erosion, taking into account the empirical evidence emerging from the psychological research on performance disruption in sports. Our expanded model allows us to unify the two main theories of performance disruption in the sport psychology literature, i.e. the self-monitoring/execution focus theory and the distraction/ overload theory, while recognizing that the typical manifestations of choke in sport competitions are best accounted for by self-monitoring/ execution focus theory. We illustrate how active inference explains some experiential aspects of choke that are familiar to sport psychol-ogists and practitioners: choke is a skill-level specific phenomenon; alleviated by ritual-like pre-performance routines; aggravated by per-sonal and contextual factors such as self-confidence erosion and performance anxiety; accompanied by a drop in the attenuation of the sense of agency normally associated with high performance and flow states.", "authors": [{"name": "Massimiliano L.

{"title": "The Universal Optimism of the Self-Evidencing Mind", "abstract": "Karl Friston’s free-energy principle casts agents as self-evidencing through active inference. This implies that decision-making, planning and information-seeking are, in a generic sense, ‘wishful’. We take an interdisciplinary perspective on this perplexing aspect of the free-energy principle and unpack the epistemological implications of wishful thinking under the free-energy principle. We use this epistemic framing to discuss the emergence of biases for self-evidencing agents. In particular, we argue that this elucidates an optimism bias as a foundational tenet of self-evidencing. We allude to a historical precursor to some of these themes, interestingly found in Machiavelli’s oeuvre, to contextualise the universal optimism of the free-energy principle.", "authors": [{"name": "Elizabeth L.

{"title": "REBUS and the Anarchic Brain: Toward a Unified Model of the Brain Action of Psychedelics", "abstract": "This paper formulates the action of psychedelics by integrating the free-energy principle and entropic brain hypothesis. We call this formulation relaxed beliefs under psychedelics (REBUS) and the anarchic brain, founded on the principle that-via their entropic effect on spontaneous cortical activity-psychedelics work to relax the precision of high-level priors or beliefs, thereby liberating bottom-up information flow, particularly via intrinsic sources such as the limbic system. We assemble evidence for this model and show how it can explain a broad range of phenomena associated with the psychedelic experience. With regard to their potential therapeutic use, we propose that psychedelics work to relax the precision weighting of pathologically overweighted priors underpinning various expressions of mental illness. We propose that this process entails an increased sensitization of high-level priors to bottom-up signaling (stemming from intrinsic sources), and that this heightened sensitivity enables the potential revision and deweighting of overweighted priors. We end by discussing further implications of the model, such as that psychedelics can bring about the revision of other heavily weighted high-level priors, not directly related to mental health, such as those underlying partisan and/or overly-confident political, religious, and/or philosophical perspectives. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Psychedelics are capturing interest, with efforts underway to bring psilocybin therapy to marketing authorisation and legal access within a decade, spearheaded by the findings of a series of phase 2 trials. In this climate, a compelling unified model of <i>how</i> psychedelics alter brain function to alter consciousness would have appeal. Towards this end, we have sought to integrate a leading model of global brain function, <i>hierarchical predictive coding</i>, with an often-cited model of the acute action of psychedelics, <i>the entropic brain hypothesis</i>. The resulting synthesis states that psychedelics work to relax high-level priors, sensitising them to liberated bottom-up information flow, which, with the right intention, care provision and context, can help guide and cultivate the revision of entrenched pathological priors.", "authors": [{"name": "Robin Carhart‐Harris", "affiliation": "University College London", "orcid": null}, {"name": "Karl

More recently, it has been proposed that Bayesian frameworks are not only useful for building descriptive models of biological functions, but that living systems themselves can be seen as Bayesian (inference) machines. On this view, the statistical tools more traditionally used to account for data in biology, neuroscience and psychology, are now used to model the mechanisms underlying functions and properties of living systems as if the systems themselves were the ones“calculating”those probabilities following Bayesian inference schemes. The free energy principle (FEP) is a framework proposed in light of this paradigm shift, advocating the minimisation of variational free energy, a proxy for sensory surprisal, as a general computational principle for biological systems. More intuitively and under some simplifying assumptions,the minimisation of variational free energy reduces,for an agent,to the minimisation of prediction errors on sensory input. Initially proposed as a candidate unifying theory of brain functioning, the FEP was later extended to encompass hypotheses on the origins of life, and is nowadays discussed in the cognitive science community for its possible implications for theories of the mind. In particular,one of the most popular process theories derived from the FEP,active inference,describes a biologically plausible algorithmic implementation of this principle with several repercussions on our understanding of cognition. In this thesis, I will focus on the role of this process theory for action and perception. In active inference, the two of them are combined in a closed sensorimotor loopasco-dependent processes of minimisation of a single loss function,variational free energy, with respect to different sets of variables. Building on this, I will suggest that some of the core ideas of active inference are best seen in terms of enactive, embodied, extended and embedded (4E) theories, in contrast to the majority of the literature emphasising its apparent connections to more traditional, computational, accounts of the mind. In particular, I will develop this argument by focusing on some proposals central to 4E approaches: (a) the non-brain-centric nature of cognitive processes,(b)the lack of explicit representations of the world,(c)the coupling of agent-environment systems and (d) the necessity of real-time feedback signals from the environment. Under the FEP formulation, I will present a series of case studies with mainly two objectives in mind: 1) to conceptually analyse and reframe these 4E ideas in the context of active inference, arguing for the advantages of their formalisation in a more general probabilistic (Bayesian) framework and, 2) to present new mathematical models and agent-based implementations of some of the conceptual connections between Bayesian inference frameworks and 4E proposals, largely missing in the literature.", "authors": [{"name": "Manuel Baltieri", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0002-6086-4711"}], "year": 2019, "doi": null, "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W2964662954", "venue": "Figshare", "citation_count": 5, "references": [], "publication_date": null}

{"title": "A probabilistic interpretation of PID controllers using active inference", "abstract": "Abstract In the past few decades, probabilistic interpretations of brain functions have become widespread in cognitive science and neuroscience. The Bayesian brain hypothesis, predictive coding, the free energy principle and active inference are increasingly popular theories of cognitive functions that claim to unify understandings of life and cognition within general mathematical frameworks derived from information theory, statistical physics and machine learning. Furthermore, it has been argued that one such proposal, active inference, combines both information and control theory and has its roots in cybernetics studies of the brain. The connections between information and control theory have been discussed since the 1950’s by scientists like Shannon and Kalman and have recently risen to prominence in modern stochastic optimal control theory. How-ever, the implications of the confluence of these two theoretical frame-works for the biological sciences have been slow to emerge. Here we argue that if the active inference proposal is to be taken as a general process theory for biological systems, we need to consider how existing control theoretical approaches to biological systems relate to it. In this work we will focus on PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controllers, one of the most common types of regulators employed in engineering and more recently used to explain behaviour in biological systems, e.g. chemotaxis in bacteria and amoebae or robust adaptation in biochemical networks. Using active inference, we derive a probabilistic interpretation of PID controllers, showing how they can fit a more general theory of life and cognition under the principle of (variational) free energy minimisation once we use only simple linear generative models.", "authors": [{"name": "Manuel Baltieri", "affiliation": "University of Sussex", "orcid": "0000-0002-6086-4711"}, {"name": "Christopher L.

{"title": "Deep Neurophenomenology", "abstract": "This chapter proposes a treatment of conscious experience based on a variational (free energy) principle for sentient systems and its corollary, active inference. Active inference is a theory that explains how sentient creatures are able to act adaptively and appropriately in their shared ecological niche—and how they change the niche to fit their expectations. In particular, we consider three recent bodies of work in the variational tradition and examine their implications for the study of conscious experience. We argue that these bodies of work provide the foundation for an active inference theory of conscious experience. This theory, hierarchical or deep neurophenomenology, extends the notion of (neural) hermeneutics to systems beyond the brain, crucially including the shared ecological niche. By emphasizing the importance of taking hierarchical spatial scales into consideration, deep hermeneutics is compatible with, but does not entail, the thesis of extended consciousness. Moreover, by focusing on multiple temporal scales, the theory provides the conceptual resources for understanding the puzzling features of time consciousness.", "authors": [{"name": "Maxwell J. D.

One fundamental yet underexplored aspect of brain and body interactions is the link between the respiratory and the nervous systems. In this article, we give an overview of the emerging literature on how respiration modulates neural, cognitive and emotional processes. Moreover, we present a perspective linking respiration to the free-energy principle. We frame volitional modulation of the breath as an active inference mechanism in which sensory evidence is recontextualized to alter interoceptive models. We further propose that respiration-entrained gamma oscillations may reflect the propagation of prediction errors from the sensory level up to cortical regions in order to alter higher level predictions.

{"title": "Active interoceptive inference and the emotional brain", "abstract": "We review a recent shift in conceptions of interoception and its relationship to hierarchical inference in the brain. The notion of interoceptive inference means that bodily states are regulated by autonomic reflexes that are enslaved by descending predictions from deep generative models of our internal and external milieu. This re-conceptualization illuminates several issues in cognitive and clinical neuroscience with implications for experiences of selfhood and emotion. We first contextualize interoception in terms of active (Bayesian) inference in the brain, highlighting its enactivist (embodied) aspects. We then consider the key role of uncertainty or precision and how this might translate into neuromodulation. We next examine the implications for understanding the functional anatomy of the emotional brain, surveying recent observations on agranular cortex. Finally, we turn to theoretical issues, namely, the role of interoception in shaping a sense of embodied self and feelings. We will draw links between physiological homoeostasis and allostasis, early cybernetic ideas of predictive control and hierarchical generative models in predictive processing.

{"title": "As One and Many: Relating Individual and Emergent Group-Level Generative Models in Active Inference", "abstract": "Active inference under the Free Energy Principle has been proposed as an across-scales compatible framework for understanding and modelling behaviour and self-maintenance. Crucially, a collective of active inference agents can, if they maintain a group-level Markov blanket, constitute a larger group-level active inference agent with a generative model of its own. This potential for computational scale-free structures speaks to the application of active inference to self-organizing systems across spatiotemporal scales, from cells to human collectives. Due to the difficulty of reconstructing the generative model that explains the behaviour of emergent group-level agents, there has been little research on this kind of multi-scale active inference. Here, we propose a data-driven methodology for characterising the relation between the generative model of a group-level agent and the dynamics of its constituent individual agents. We apply methods from computational cognitive modelling and computational psychiatry, applicable for active inference as well as other types of modelling approaches. Using a simple Multi-Armed Bandit task as an example, we employ the new ActiveInference.jl library for Julia to simulate a collective of agents who are equipped with a Markov blanket. We use sampling-based parameter estimation to make inferences about the generative model of the group-level agent, and we show that there is a non-trivial relationship between the generative models of individual agents and the group-level agent they constitute, even in this simple setting. Finally, we point to a number of ways in which this methodology might be applied to better understand the relations between nested active inference agents across scales.", "authors": [{"name": "Peter Thestrup Waade", "affiliation": "Aarhus University", "orcid": "0000-0002-6061-0084"}, {"name": "C.

{"title": "Bayesian Analogical Cybernetics", "abstract": "It has been argued that all of cognition can be understood in terms of Bayesian inference. It has also been argued that analogy is the core of cognition. Here I will propose that these perspectives are fully compatible, in that analogical reasoning can be described in terms of Bayesian inference and vice versa, and that both of these positions require a thorough cybernetic grounding in order to fulfill their promise as unifying frameworks for understanding minds. From the Bayesian perspective of the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference framework, thought is constituted by dynamics of cascading belief propagation through the nodes of probabilistic generative models specified by a cortical heterarchy \"rooted\" in action-perception cycles that ground the mind as an embodied control system for an autonomous agent. From the analogical structure mapping perspective, thought is constituted by the alignment and comparison of heterogeneous structural representations. Here I will propose that this core cognitive process for analogical reasoning is naturally implemented by predictive coding mechanisms. However, both Bayesian cognitive science and models of cognitive development via analogical reasoning require rich base domains and priors (or reliably learnable posteriors) from which they can commence the process of bootstrapping minds. Here in the spirit of the work of George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, I propose that embodiment provides many of the inductive biases that are usually described in terms of innate core knowledge.

{"title": "Integrating Cybernetic Big Five Theory with the Free Energy Principle: A new strategy for modeling personalities as complex systems", "abstract": "Cybernetics is the study of goal-directed systems that self-regulate via feedback, a category that includes human beings. Cybernetic Big Five Theory (CB5T) attempts to explain personality in cybernetic terms, conceptualizing personality traits as manifestations of variation in parameters of the neural mechanisms that evolved to facilitate cybernetic control. The Free Energy Principle and Active Inference framework (FEP-AI) is an overarching approach for understanding how it is that complex systems manage to persist in a world governed by the second law of thermodynamics—the inevitable tendency toward entropy. Although these two cybernetic theories were developed independently, they overlap in their theoretical foundations and implications and are complementary in their approaches to understanding persons. FEP-AI contributes a potentially valuable formal modeling framework for CB5T, while CB5T provides detail about the science and structure of personality. In this chapter we explore how CB5T and FEP-AI may begin to be integrated into a unified approach to modeling persons.", "authors": [{"name": "Adam Safron", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0002-3102-7623"}, {"name": "Colin G.

{"title": "Scientific Machine Learning Through Physics–Informed Neural Networks: Where we are and What’s Next", "abstract": "Abstract Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) are neural networks (NNs) that encode model equations, like Partial Differential Equations (PDE), as a component of the neural network itself. PINNs are nowadays used to solve PDEs, fractional equations, integral-differential equations, and stochastic PDEs. This novel methodology has arisen as a multi-task learning framework in which a NN must fit observed data while reducing a PDE residual. This article provides a comprehensive review of the literature on PINNs: while the primary goal of the study was to characterize these networks and their related advantages and disadvantages. The review also attempts to incorporate publications on a broader range of collocation-based physics informed neural networks, which stars form the vanilla PINN, as well as many other variants, such as physics-constrained neural networks (PCNN), variational hp-VPINN, and conservative PINN (CPINN). The study indicates that most research has focused on customizing the PINN through different activation functions, gradient optimization techniques, neural network structures, and loss function structures. Despite the wide range of applications for which PINNs have been used, by demonstrating their ability to be more feasible in some contexts than classical numerical techniques like Finite Element Method (FEM), advancements are still possible, most notably theoretical issues that remain unresolved.", "authors": [{"name": "Salvatore Cuomo", "affiliation": "University of Naples Federico II",

{"title": "Hierarchical Models in the Brain", "abstract": "This paper describes a general model that subsumes many parametric models for continuous data. The model comprises hidden layers of state-space or dynamic causal models, arranged so that the output of one provides input to another. The ensuing hierarchy furnishes a model for many types of data, of arbitrary complexity. Special cases range from the general linear model for static data to generalised convolution models, with system noise, for nonlinear time-series analysis. Crucially, all of these models can be inverted using exactly the same scheme, namely, dynamic expectation maximization. This means that a single model and optimisation scheme can be used to invert a wide range of models. We present the model and a brief review of its inversion to disclose the relationships among, apparently, diverse generative models of empirical data. We then show that this inversion can be formulated as a simple neural network and may provide a useful metaphor for inference and learning in the brain.", "authors": [{"name": "Karl Friston", "affiliation": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging", "orcid": "0000-0001-7984-8909"}], "year": 2008, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000211", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W1977628053", "venue": "PLoS Computational Biology", "citation_count": 963, "references": ["openalex:W19535118", "openalex:W1486520839", "openalex:W1504499192", "openalex:W1570770495", "openalex:W1599549671", "openalex:W1610511020", "openalex:W1613865483", "openalex:W1746680969", "openalex:W1971758547", "openalex:W1975700187", "openalex:W1978510898", "openalex:W1981025738", "openalex:W1982395728", "openalex:W1982585616", "openalex:W1983617554", "openalex:W1986014504", "openalex:W1988276046", "openalex:W1991362484", "openalex:W1994482394", "openalex:W2001635516", "openalex:W2003315976", "openalex:W2005866069", "openalex:W2009362065", "openalex:W2012521891", "openalex:W2017960075", "openalex:W2022995207", "openalex:W2026799324", "openalex:W2035322026", "openalex:W2040891197", "openalex:W2044318790", "openalex:W2044860336", "openalex:W2049633694", "openalex:W2049778605", "openalex:W2057749702", "openalex:W2058277424", "openalex:W2072857774", "openalex:W2081256153", "openalex:W2083441835", "openalex:W2085989895", "openalex:W2096193724", "openalex:W2096375888", "openalex:W2098580305", "openalex:W2103139809", "openalex:W2105934661", "openalex:W2108384452", "openalex:W2110712908", "openalex:W2112575206", "openalex:W2113257799", "openalex:W2116705226", "openalex:W2116864589", "openalex:W2118615399", "openalex:W2119885245", "openalex:W2120449116", "openalex:W2122512809", "openalex:W2124800921", "openalex:W2125027820", "openalex:W2125663122", "openalex:W2126750122", "openalex:W2127407604", "openalex:W2127958135", "openalex:W2128931495", "openalex:W2128973832", "openalex:W2131352719", "openalex:W2139923370", "openalex:W2145439642", "openalex:W2145563972", "openalex:W2145889472", "openalex:W2147008239", "openalex:W2148389554", "openalex:W2148601705", "openalex:W2151189852", "openalex:W2154562678", "openalex:W2158935809", "openalex:W2159088729", "openalex:W2159550387", "openalex:W2165055912", "openalex:W2166471921", "openalex:W2168016523", "openalex:W2485341146", "openalex:W2567948266", "openalex:W2766736793", "openalex:W2912889105", "openalex:W2985382943", "openalex:W2989448192", "openalex:W3151409487", "openalex:W3207342693", "openalex:W4212952892", "openalex:W4230093002", "openalex:W4240947882", "openalex:W4242807147", "openalex:W4251227784", "openalex:W4253785936", "openalex:W4285719527", "openalex:W6656163072", "openalex:W6676678159", "openalex:W6678361441", "openalex:W6683178348", "openalex:W6812650097", "openalex:W6816390053", "openalex:W6831468618", "openalex:W7000602047", "openalex:W7062489933"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "The Computational Anatomy of Psychosis", "abstract": "This paper considers psychotic symptoms in terms of false inferences or beliefs. It is based on the notion that the brain is an inference machine that actively constructs hypotheses to explain or predict its sensations. This perspective provides a normative (Bayes-optimal) account of action and perception that emphasizes probabilistic representations; in particular, the confidence or precision of beliefs about the world. We will consider hallucinosis, abnormal eye movements, sensory attenuation deficits, catatonia, and delusions as various expressions of the same core pathology: namely, an aberrant encoding of precision. From a cognitive perspective, this represents a pernicious failure of metacognition (beliefs about beliefs) that can confound perceptual inference. In the embodied setting of active (Bayesian) inference, it can lead to behaviors that are paradoxically more accurate than Bayes-optimal behavior. Crucially, this normative account is accompanied by a neuronally plausible process theory based upon hierarchical predictive coding. In predictive coding, precision is thought to be encoded by the post-synaptic gain of neurons reporting prediction error. This suggests that both pervasive trait abnormalities and florid failures of inference in the psychotic state can be linked to factors controlling post-synaptic gain – such as NMDA receptor function and (dopaminergic) neuromodulation. We illustrate these points using biologically plausible simulations of perceptual synthesis, smooth pursuit eye movements and attribution of agency – that all use the same predictive coding scheme and pathology: namely, a reduction in the precision of prior beliefs, relative to sensory evidence.", "authors": [{"name": "Rick A.

{"title": "Unification of free energy minimization, spatiotemporal energy, and dimension reduction models of V1 organization: Postnatal learning on an antenatal scaffold", "abstract": "Developmental selection of neurons and synapses so as to maximize pulse synchrony has recently been used to explain antenatal cortical development. Consequences of the same selection process—an application of the Free Energy Principle—are here followed into the postnatal phase in V1, and the implications for cognitive function are considered. Structured inputs transformed via lag relay in superficial patch connections lead to the generation of circumferential synaptic connectivity superimposed upon the antenatal, radial, “like-to-like” connectivity surrounding each singularity. The spatiotemporal energy and dimension reduction models of cortical feature preferences are accounted for and unified within the expanded model, and relationships of orientation preference (OP), space frequency preference (SFP), and temporal frequency preference (TFP) are resolved. The emergent anatomy provides a basis for “active inference” that includes interpolative modification of synapses so as to anticipate future inputs, as well as learn directly from present stimuli. Neurodynamic properties are those of heteroclinic networks with coupled spatial eigenmodes.", "authors": [{"name": "James J.

{"title": "Life as we know it", "abstract": "This paper presents a heuristic proof (and simulations of a primordial soup) suggesting that life—or biological self-organization—is an inevitable and emergent property of any (ergodic) random dynamical system that possesses a Markov blanket. This conclusion is based on the following arguments: if the coupling among an ensemble of dynamical systems is mediated by short-range forces, then the states of remote systems must be conditionally independent. These independencies induce a Markov blanket that separates internal and external states in a statistical sense. The existence of a Markov blanket means that internal states will appear to minimize a free energy functional of the states of their Markov blanket. Crucially, this is the same quantity that is optimized in Bayesian inference. Therefore, the internal states (and their blanket) will appear to engage in active Bayesian inference. In other words, they will appear to model—and act on—their world to preserve their functional and structural integrity, leading to homoeostasis and a simple form of autopoiesis.", "authors": [{"name": "Karl Friston", "affiliation": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging", "orcid": "0000-0001-7984-8909"}], "year": 2013, "doi": "10.1098/rsif.2013.0475", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W2055789905", "venue": "Journal of The Royal Society Interface", "citation_count": 668, "references": ["openalex:W81409850", "openalex:W563131707", "openalex:W1556913189", "openalex:W1582771551", "openalex:W1584724822", "openalex:W1601036473", "openalex:W1944446569", "openalex:W1965555277", "openalex:W1971123690", "openalex:W1971283401", "openalex:W1971715144", "openalex:W1973219195", "openalex:W1980230793", "openalex:W1980661496", "openalex:W1983249679", "openalex:W1983941091", "openalex:W1988819089", "openalex:W1993900316", "openalex:W1998948338", "openalex:W2000867087", "openalex:W2003900693", "openalex:W2006062868", "openalex:W2014848186", "openalex:W2026799324", "openalex:W2032558547", "openalex:W2033422410", "openalex:W2044386301", "openalex:W2047229728", "openalex:W2048648663", "openalex:W2053423120", "openalex:W2059156134", "openalex:W2061097716", "openalex:W2065264265", "openalex:W2067505402", "openalex:W2070430318", "openalex:W2073955207", "openalex:W2093879971", "openalex:W2099530148", "openalex:W2107280169", "openalex:W2115979064", "openalex:W2122249653", "openalex:W2125663122", "openalex:W2127531110", "openalex:W2128666650", "openalex:W2128957129", "openalex:W2147008239", "openalex:W2148764920", "openalex:W2152742892", "openalex:W2152909569", "openalex:W2154123408", "openalex:W2158065370", "openalex:W2159080219", "openalex:W2166811440", "openalex:W2168016523", "openalex:W2172463260", "openalex:W2317030384", "openalex:W2321141082", "openalex:W2493894436", "openalex:W3121698465", "openalex:W4213348475", "openalex:W4231516052", "openalex:W4237718205", "openalex:W4251227784", "openalex:W6658723161"], "publication_date": null}

{"title": "Learning in embodied action-perception loops through exploration", "abstract": "Although exploratory behaviors are ubiquitous in the animal kingdom, their computational underpinnings are still largely unknown. Behavioral Psychology has identified learning as a primary drive underlying many exploratory behaviors. Exploration is seen as a means for an animal to gather sensory data useful for reducing its ignorance about the environment. While related problems have been addressed in Data Mining and Reinforcement Learning, the computational modeling of learning-driven exploration by embodied agents is largely unrepresented. Here, we propose a computational theory for learning-driven exploration based on the concept of missing information that allows an agent to identify informative actions using Bayesian inference. We demonstrate that when embodiment constraints are high, agents must actively coordinate their actions to learn efficiently. Compared to earlier approaches, our exploration policy yields more efficient learning across a range of worlds with diverse structures. The improved learning in turn affords greater success in general tasks including navigation and reward gathering.

{"title": "Kalman filters as the steady-state solution of gradient descent on variational free energy", "abstract": "The Kalman filter is an algorithm for the estimation of hidden variables in dynamical systems under linear Gauss-Markov assumptions with widespread applications across different fields. Recently, its Bayesian interpretation has received a growing amount of attention especially in neuroscience, robotics and machine learning. In neuroscience, in particular, models of perception and control under the banners of predictive coding, optimal feedback control, active inference and more generally the so-called Bayesian brain hypothesis, have all heavily relied on ideas behind the Kalman filter. Active inference, an algorithmic theory based on the free energy principle, specifically builds on approximate Bayesian inference methods proposing a variational account of neural computation and behaviour in terms of gradients of variational free energy. Using this ambitious framework, several works have discussed different possible relations between free energy minimisation and standard Kalman filters. With a few exceptions, however, such relations point at a mere qualitative resemblance or are built on a set of very diverse comparisons based on purported differences between free energy minimisation and Kalman filtering. In this work, we present a straightforward derivation of Kalman filters consistent with active inference via a variational treatment of free energy minimisation in terms of gradient descent. The approach considered here offers a more direct link between models of neural dynamics as gradient descent and standard accounts of perception and decision making based on probabilistic inference, further bridging the gap between hypotheses about neural implementation and computational principles in brain and behavioural sciences.", "authors": [{"name": "Manuel Baltieri", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0002-6086-4711"}, {"name": "Takuya Isomura", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0003-2960-4919"}], "year": 2021, "doi": "10.48550/arxiv.2111.10530", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W3215555963", "venue": "arXiv (Cornell University)", "citation_count": 3, "references": ["openalex:W88520345", "openalex:W345640859", "openalex:W1490667783", "openalex:W1516111018", "openalex:W1546485431", "openalex:W1569512666", "openalex:W1578226955", "openalex:W1603631609", "openalex:W1663973292", "openalex:W1977628053", "openalex:W1979732124", "openalex:W1980246751", "openalex:W1980440818", "openalex:W1981905332", "openalex:W1986462127", "openalex:W1990223947", "openalex:W2013554506", "openalex:W2016625584", "openalex:W2017424427", "openalex:W2036084078", "openalex:W2036323349", "openalex:W2040891197", "openalex:W2059156134", "openalex:W2059320470", "openalex:W2071048859", "openalex:W2078059111", "openalex:W2092383562", "openalex:W2101576232", "openalex:W2103139809", "openalex:W2115979064", "openalex:W2116396565", "openalex:W2119885245", "openalex:W2120079537", "openalex:W2122458046", "openalex:W2122512809", "openalex:W2132003317", "openalex:W2140487181", "openalex:W2145572963", "openalex:W2148242024", "openalex:W2148764920", "openalex:W2148848065", "openalex:W2151496011", "openalex:W2153418039", "openalex:W2153791616", "openalex:W2154123408", "openalex:W2222172745", "openalex:W2324665722", "openalex:W2525228457", "openalex:W2552810632", "openalex:W2604086949", "openalex:W2612241113", "openalex:W2623066203", "openalex:W2767022047", "openalex:W2773812526", "openalex:W2792679026", "openalex:W2793221085", "openalex:W2801487100", "openalex:W2898987415", "openalex:W2906977749", "openalex:W2913907987", "openalex:W2918957485", "openalex:W2947609478", "openalex:W2951666363", "openalex:W2954626430", "openalex:W2962984936", "openalex:W2963241052", "openalex:W2980655938", "openalex:W2984094534", "openalex:W2989729815", "openalex:W2996530576", "openalex:W3024686689", "openalex:W3027231994", "openalex:W3043807078", "openalex:W3045763022", "openalex:W3101221933", "openalex:W3112172194", "openalex:W3123260937", "openalex:W3139813835", "openalex:W3140968660", "openalex:W3161347197", "openalex:W3163829518", "openalex:W3174962106", "openalex:W3180014105", "openalex:W3181795511", "openalex:W3183787066", "openalex:W3186883833", "openalex:W3201764424"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Path integrals, particular kinds, and strange things", "abstract": "This paper describes a path integral formulation of the free energy principle. The ensuing account expresses the paths or trajectories that a particle takes as it evolves over time. The main results are a method or principle of least action that can be used to emulate the behaviour of particles in open exchange with their external milieu. Particles are defined by a particular partition, in which internal states are individuated from external states by active and sensory blanket states. The variational principle at hand allows one to interpret internal dynamics - of certain kinds of particles - as inferring external states that are hidden behind blanket states. We consider different kinds of particles, and to what extent they can be imbued with an elementary form of inference or sentience. Specifically, we consider the distinction between dissipative and conservative particles, inert and active particles and, finally, ordinary and strange particles. Strange particles can be described as inferring their own actions, endowing them with apparent autonomy or agency. In short - of the kinds of particles afforded by a particular partition - strange kinds may be apt for describing sentient behaviour.", "authors": [{"name": "Karl Friston", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0001-7984-8909"}, {"name": "Lancelot Da Costa", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0003-0126-4588"}, {"name": "Dalton A R Sakthivadivel", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0002-7907-7611"}, {"name": "Conor Heins", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0002-5884-7728"}, {"name": "Grigorios A.

{"title": "Applying the Free-Energy Principle to Complex Adaptive Systems", "abstract": "The free energy principle is a mathematical theory of the behaviour of self-organising systems that originally gained prominence as a unified model of the brain. Since then, the theory has been applied to a plethora of biological phenomena, extending from single-celled and multicellular organisms through to niche construction and human culture, and even the emergence of life itself. The free energy principle tells us that perception and action operate synergistically to minimize an organism&rsquo;s exposure to surprising biological states, which are more likely to lead to decay. A key corollary of this hypothesis is active inference&mdash;the idea that all behavior involves the selective sampling of sensory data so that we experience what we expect to (in order to avoid surprises). Simply put, we act upon the world to fulfill our expectations. It is now widely recognized that the implications of the free energy principle for our understanding of the human mind and behavior are far-reaching and profound. To date, however, its capacity to extend beyond our brain&mdash;to more generally explain living and other complex adaptive systems&mdash;has only just begun to be explored. The aim of this collection is to showcase the breadth of the free energy principle as a unified theory of complex adaptive systems&mdash;conscious, social, living, or not.", "authors": [{"name": "Paul B.

{"title": "Modeling Autonomous Vehicle Responses to Novel Observations Using Hierarchical Cognitive Representations Inspired Active Inference", "abstract": "Equipping autonomous agents for dynamic interaction and navigation is a significant challenge in intelligent transportation systems. This study aims to address this by implementing a brain-inspired model for decision making in autonomous vehicles. We employ active inference, a Bayesian approach that models decision-making processes similar to the human brain, focusing on the agent’s preferences and the principle of free energy. This approach is combined with imitation learning to enhance the vehicle’s ability to adapt to new observations and make human-like decisions. The research involved developing a multi-modal self-awareness architecture for autonomous driving systems and testing this model in driving scenarios, including abnormal observations. The results demonstrated the model’s effectiveness in enabling the vehicle to make safe decisions, particularly in unobserved or dynamic environments. The study concludes that the integration of active inference with imitation learning significantly improves the performance of autonomous vehicles, offering a promising direction for future developments in intelligent transportation systems.", "authors": [{"name": "Sheida Nozari", "affiliation": "University of Genoa", "orcid": "0000-0002-7767-6178"}, {"name": "Ali Krayani", "affiliation": "University of Genoa", "orcid": "0000-0002-6598-2805"}, {"name": "Pablo Marín", "affiliation": "Universidad Carlos III de Madrid", "orcid": "0000-0001-7196-434X"}, {"name": "Lucio Marcenaro", "affiliation": "University of Genoa", "orcid": "0000-0003-1515-120X"}, {"name": "David Martín", "affiliation": "Universidad Carlos III de Madrid", "orcid": "0000-0003-3764-5083"}, {"name": "Carlo S.

{"title": "Active Inference and Intentional Behaviour", "abstract": "Recent advances in theoretical biology suggest that basal cognition and sentient behaviour are emergent properties of in vitro cell cultures and neuronal networks, respectively. Such neuronal networks spontaneously learn structured behaviours in the absence of reward or reinforcement. In this paper, we characterise this kind of self-organisation through the lens of the free energy principle, i.e., as self-evidencing. We do this by first discussing the definitions of reactive and sentient behaviour in the setting of active inference, which describes the behaviour of agents that model the consequences of their actions. We then introduce a formal account of intentional behaviour, that describes agents as driven by a preferred endpoint or goal in latent state-spaces. We then investigate these forms of (reactive, sentient, and intentional) behaviour using simulations. First, we simulate the aforementioned in vitro experiments, in which neuronal cultures spontaneously learn to play Pong, by implementing nested, free energy minimising processes. The simulations are then used to deconstruct the ensuing predictive behaviour, leading to the distinction between merely reactive, sentient, and intentional behaviour, with the latter formalised in terms of inductive planning. This distinction is further studied using simple machine learning benchmarks (navigation in a grid world and the Tower of Hanoi problem), that show how quickly and efficiently adaptive behaviour emerges under an inductive form of active inference.", "authors": [{"name": "Karl Friston", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0001-7984-8909"}, {"name": "Tommaso Salvatori", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0002-7254-9882"}, {"name": "Takuya Isomura", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0003-2960-4919"}, {"name": "Alexander Tschantz", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0002-9751-5929"}, {"name": "Alex Kiefer", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0003-1957-797X"}, {"name": "Tim Verbelen", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0003-2731-7262"}, {"name": "Magnus Koudahl", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0003-3411-5036"}, {"name": "Aswin Paul", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0002-8559-4711"}, {"name": "Thomas Parr", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0001-5108-5743"}, {"name": "Adeel Razi", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0002-0779-9439"}, {"name": "Brett J.

{"title": "Perceptual Presence in the Kuhnian-Popperian Bayesian Brain", "abstract": "Anil Seth’s target paper connects the framework of PP (predictive processing) and the FEP (free-energy principle) to cybernetic principles. Exploiting an analogy to theory of science, Seth draws a distinction between three types of active inference. The first type involves confirmatory hypothesis-testing. The other types involve seeking disconfirming and disambiguating evidence, respectively. Furthermore, Seth applies PP to various fascinating phenomena, including perceptual presence. In this commentary, I explore how far we can take the analogy between explanation in perception and explanation in science.In the first part, I draw a slightly broader analogy between PP and concepts in theory of science, by asking whether the Bayesian brain is Kuhnian or Popperian. While many aspects of PP are in line with Karl Popper’s falsificationism, other aspects of PP conform to how Thomas Kuhn described scientific revolutions. Thus, there is both a sense in which the Bayesian brain is Kuhnian, and a sense in which it is Popperian. The upshot of these considerations is that falsification in PP can take many different forms. In particular, active inference can be used to falsify a model in more ways than identified by Seth. In the second part of this commentary, I focus on Seth’s PPSMCT (predictive processing account of sensorimotor contingency theory) and its application to perceptual presence, which assigns a crucial role to counterfactual richness. In my discussion, I question the significance of counterfactual richness for perceptual presence. First, I highlight an ambiguity inherent in Seth’s descriptions of the target phenomenon (perceptual presence vs. objecthood). Then I suggest that counterfactual richness may not be the crucial underlying feature (of either perceptual presence of objecthood). Giving a series of examples, I argue that the degree of represented causal integration is an equally good candidate for accounting for perceptual presence (or objecthood), although more work needs to be done.", "authors": [{"name": "Wanja Wiese", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0003-3338-7398"}], "year": 2015, "doi": "10.15502/9783958570207", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W72555770", "venue": null, "citation_count": 10, "references": ["openalex:W6539917", "openalex:W83883440", "openalex:W123148467", "openalex:W379488513", "openalex:W565490644", "openalex:W1456772534", "openalex:W1498155717", "openalex:W1571765187", "openalex:W1582174699", "openalex:W1641224416", "openalex:W1950864686", "openalex:W1967826667", "openalex:W1973832683", "openalex:W1982693412", "openalex:W1988814994", "openalex:W1991282939", "openalex:W1991880520", "openalex:W1997901895", "openalex:W2001685400", "openalex:W2019515298", "openalex:W2023043173", "openalex:W2039546655", "openalex:W2040834369", "openalex:W2059156134", "openalex:W2062475609", "openalex:W2080654992", "openalex:W2087460754", "openalex:W2094014201", "openalex:W2127531110", "openalex:W2140723753", "openalex:W2147617226", "openalex:W2153791616", "openalex:W2157376352", "openalex:W2157754891", "openalex:W2317030384", "openalex:W2492047896", "openalex:W2495613807", "openalex:W2546408443", "openalex:W2753533763", "openalex:W3157926951"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Integrated World Modeling Theory (IWMT) Expanded: Implications for Theories of Consciousness and Artificial Intelligence", "abstract": "Integrated World Modeling Theory (IWMT) is a synthetic theory of consciousness that uses the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference (FEP-AI) framework to combine insights from Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT). Here, I first review philosophical principles and neural systems contributing to IWMT’s integrative perspective. I then go on to describe predictive processing models of brains and their connections to machine learning architectures, with particular emphasis on autoencoders (perceptual and active inference), turbo-codes (establishment of shared latent spaces for multi-modal integration and inferential synergy), and graph neural networks (spatial and somatic modeling and control). Particular emphasis is placed on the hippocampal/entorhinal system, which may provide a source of high-level reasoning via predictive contrasting and generalized navigation, so affording multiple kinds of conscious access. Future directions for IIT and GNWT are considered by exploring ways in which modules and workspaces may be evaluated as both complexes of integrated information and arenas for iterated Bayesian model selection. Based on these considerations, I suggest novel ways in which integrated information might be estimated using concepts from probabilistic graphical models, flow networks, and game theory. Mechanistic and computational principles are also considered with respect to the ongoing debate between IIT and GNWT regarding the physical substrates of different kinds of conscious and unconscious phenomena. I further explore how these ideas might relate to the “Bayesian blur problem”, or how it is that a seemingly discrete experience can be generated from probabilistic modeling, with some consideration of analogies from quantum mechanics as potentially revealing different varieties of inferential dynamics. Finally, I go on to describe parallels between FEP-AI and theories of universal intelligence, including with respect to implications for the future of artificially intelligent systems. Particular emphasis is given to the pioneering work of Schmidhuber and colleagues, who have been designing world modeling architectures for over three decades. These discussions include recurrent computation and its relationships with feedforward processing, including potential means of addressing critiques of causal structure theories based on network unfolding, and the seeming absurdity of conscious expander graphs (without cybernetic symbol grounding).

{"title": "Ambient smart environments: affordances, allostasis, and wellbeing", "abstract": "Abstract In this paper we assess the functionality and therapeutic potential of ambient smart environments. We argue that the language of affordances alone fails to do justice to the peculiar functionality of this ambient technology, and draw from theoretical approaches based on the free energy principle and active inference. We argue that ambient smart environments should be understood as playing an'upstream' role, shaping an agent's field of affordances in real time, in an adaptive way that supports an optimal grip on a field of affordances. We characterise this optimal grip using precision weighting, and in terms of allostatic control, drawing an analogy with the role of precision weighting in metacognitive processes. One key insight we present is that ambient smart environments may support allostatic control not only by simplifying an agent's problem space, but by increasing uncertainty, in order to destabilise calcified, sub-optimal, psychological and behavioural patterns. In short, we lay an empirically-grounded theoretical foundation for understanding ambient smart environments, and for answering related philosophical questions around agency, trust, and subjective wellbeing.", "authors": [{"name": "Ben White", "affiliation": "University of Sussex", "orcid": "0000-0002-0016-1950"}, {"name": "Mark Miller", "affiliation": "University of Toronto", "orcid": "0000-0003-1783-889X"}], "year": 2024, "doi": "10.1007/s11229-024-04679-9", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W4400832140", "venue": "Synthese", "citation_count": 8, "references": ["openalex:W17670219", "openalex:W31659055", "openalex:W1489032534", "openalex:W1524895715", "openalex:W1974873567", "openalex:W1981748148", "openalex:W1989416066", "openalex:W1992903142", "openalex:W2002907081", "openalex:W2005891124", "openalex:W2026913377", "openalex:W2029262927", "openalex:W2038941562", "openalex:W2042169526", "openalex:W2052143620", "openalex:W2055789905", "openalex:W2071271451", "openalex:W2093950336", "openalex:W2096962395", "openalex:W2108301231", "openalex:W2110171129", "openalex:W2115460576", "openalex:W2124705652", "openalex:W2126502833", "openalex:W2130195834", "openalex:W2135713127", "openalex:W2148764920", "openalex:W2153791616", "openalex:W2154123408", "openalex:W2157002843", "openalex:W2280014445", "openalex:W2291702528", "openalex:W2505101982", "openalex:W2522211705", "openalex:W2531083186", "openalex:W2579583215", "openalex:W2584391386", "openalex:W2584975604", "openalex:W2608187890", "openalex:W2758021935", "openalex:W2765412958", "openalex:W2787356230", "openalex:W2789633685", "openalex:W2796601284", "openalex:W2892266804", "openalex:W2897486048", "openalex:W2914342221", "openalex:W2919133773", "openalex:W2936416517", "openalex:W2953321017", "openalex:W2954761528", "openalex:W2955483757", "openalex:W2970714527", "openalex:W2976973594", "openalex:W2995318065", "openalex:W2998334652", "openalex:W2999381182", "openalex:W3038775985", "openalex:W3042416448", "openalex:W3049339894", "openalex:W3049709870", "openalex:W3082607047", "openalex:W3084516152", "openalex:W3084692426", "openalex:W3096810469", "openalex:W3102454099", "openalex:W3108742966", "openalex:W3111429792", "openalex:W3161563022", "openalex:W3162663886", "openalex:W3163652985", "openalex:W3164606141", "openalex:W3164868732", "openalex:W3169104567", "openalex:W3184115678", "openalex:W3186428487", "openalex:W3194480143", "openalex:W3195069619", "openalex:W3207097194", "openalex:W4206045248", "openalex:W4206079579", "openalex:W4212971928", "openalex:W4212973328", "openalex:W4220811164", "openalex:W4224222155", "openalex:W4226400653", "openalex:W4229450290", "openalex:W4241976975", "openalex:W4247883378", "openalex:W4250278456", "openalex:W4253935475", "openalex:W4281796270", "openalex:W4285676717", "openalex:W4291140527", "openalex:W4383334773", "openalex:W4386173807", "openalex:W4389839629", "openalex:W4391320820", "openalex:W4395672896", "openalex:W4407738866", "openalex:W6607789082", "openalex:W6742601162", "openalex:W6812632051", "openalex:W7030180902", "openalex:W7070443497"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Active Inference in Psychology and Psychiatry: Progress to Date?", "abstract": "The free energy principle is a formal theory of adaptive self-organising systems that emerged from statistical thermodynamics, machine learning and theoretical neuroscience and has since been translated into biologically plausible ‘process theories’ of cognition and behaviour, which fall under the banner of ‘active inference’. Despite the promise this theory holds for theorising, research and practical applications in psychology and psychiatry, its impact on these disciplines has only now begun to bear fruit. The aim of this treatment is to consider the extent to which active inference has informed theoretical progress in psychology, before exploring its contributions to our understanding and treatment of psychopathology. Despite facing persistent translational obstacles, progress suggests that active inference has the potential to become a new paradigm that promises to unite psychology’s subdisciplines, while readily incorporating the traditionally competing paradigms of evolutionary and developmental psychology. To date, however, progress towards this end has been slow. Meanwhile, the main outstanding question is whether this theory will make a positive difference through applications in clinical psychology, and its sister discipline of psychiatry.", "authors": [{"name": "Paul B.

{"title": "A dual-model approach to blind quality assessment of noisy images", "abstract": "Physiological and psychological evidences exist that the human visual system (HVS) has different behavioral patterns under low and high noise/artifact levels. We propose in this paper a dual-model approach to blind or no-reference (NR) image quality assessment (IQA) of noisy images through differentiating near-threshold and suprathreshold noise conditions. The underlying assumption for the proposed dual-model method is that for images with low level near-threshold noise, HVS tries to gauge the strength of the noise, so the image quality can be well approximated via measuring strength of the noise. And for images with their contents overwhelmed by high level suprathreshold noise, the HVS tries to recover meaningful structure from the noisy pixels using past experiences and prior knowledge encoded into an internal generative model of the brain. So image quality is closely related to the agreement between the noisy observation and the internal generative model explainable part of the image. More specifically, under the near-threshold noise condition, a noise level estimation algorithm based on natural image statistics is used, while under suprathreshold condition, an active inference model based on the free energy principle is adopted. The near-and suprathreshold models can be seamlessly integrated through a transformation between both estimates. The proposed dual-model algorithm has been tested on additive Gaussian noise contaminated images. Experimental results and comparative studies suggest that although being a no-reference approach, the proposed algorithm has prediction accuracy comparable to some of the best full-reference (FR) IQA methods.", "authors": [{"name": "Guangtao Zhai", "affiliation": "Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg", "orcid": "0000-0001-8165-9322"}, {"name": "André Kaup", "affiliation": "Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg", "orcid": "0000-0002-0929-5074"}, {"name": "Jia Wang", "affiliation": "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "orcid": "0009-0007-6556-5706"}, {"name": "Xiaokang Yang", "affiliation": "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "orcid": "0000-0003-4029-3322"}], "year": 2013, "doi": "10.1109/pcs.2013.6737675", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W4245113034", "venue": null, "citation_count": 12, "references": ["openalex:W1980499624", "openalex:W1982471090", "openalex:W2009272644", "openalex:W2046119925", "openalex:W2046684161", "openalex:W2112409076", "openalex:W2113032778", "openalex:W2114582993", "openalex:W2119999314", "openalex:W2129644086", "openalex:W2133665775", "openalex:W2141983208", "openalex:W2142884912", "openalex:W2147008239", "openalex:W2151035455", "openalex:W2158546915", "openalex:W2162692770", "openalex:W2163370434", "openalex:W3182211633", "openalex:W6662037909"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Applications of the Free Energy Principle to Machine Learning and Neuroscience", "abstract": "In this PhD thesis, we explore and apply methods inspired by the free energy principle to two important areas in machine learning and neuroscience. The free energy principle is a general mathematical theory of the necessary information-theoretic behaviours of systems that maintain a separation from their environment. A core postulate of the theory is that complex systems can be seen as performing variational Bayesian inference and minimizing an information-theoretic quantity called the variational free energy. The thesis is structured into three independent sections. Firstly, we focus on predictive coding, a neurobiologically plausible process theory derived from the free energy principle which argues that the primary function of the brain is to minimize prediction errors, showing how predictive coding can be scaled up and extended to be more biologically plausible, and elucidating its close links with other methods such as Kalman Filtering. Secondly, we study active inference, a neurobiologically grounded account of action through variational message passing, and investigate how these methods can be scaled up to match the performance of deep reinforcement learning methods. We additionally provide a detailed mathematical understanding of the nature and origin of the information-theoretic objectives that underlie exploratory behaviour. Finally, we investigate biologically plausible methods of credit assignment in the brain. We first demonstrate a close link between predictive coding and the backpropagation of error algorithm. We go on to propose novel and simpler algorithms which allow for backprop to be implemented in purely local, biologically plausible computations.", "authors": [{"name": "Beren Millidge", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0003-1872-5635"}], "year": 2021, "doi": "10.48550/arxiv.2107.00140", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W4394648279", "venue": "arXiv (Cornell University)", "citation_count": 3, "references": [], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "The Radically Embodied Conscious Cybernetic Bayesian Brain: From Free Energy to Free Will and Back Again", "abstract": "Drawing from both enactivist and cognitivist perspectives on mind, I propose that explaining teleological phenomena may require reappraising both “Cartesian theaters” and mental homunculi in terms of embodied self-models (ESMs), understood as body maps with agentic properties, functioning as predictive-memory systems and cybernetic controllers. Quasi-homuncular ESMs are suggested to constitute a major organizing principle for neural architectures due to their initial and ongoing significance for solutions to inference problems in cognitive (and affective) development. Embodied experiences provide foundational lessons in learning curriculums in which agents explore increasingly challenging problem spaces, so answering an unresolved question in Bayesian cognitive science: what are biologically plausible mechanisms for equipping learners with sufficiently powerful inductive biases to adequately constrain inference spaces? Drawing on models from neurophysiology, psychology, and developmental robotics, I describe how embodiment provides fundamental sources of empirical priors (as reliably learnable posterior expectations). If ESMs play this kind of foundational role in cognitive development, then bidirectional linkages will be found between all sensory modalities and frontal-parietal control hierarchies, so infusing all senses with somatic-motoric properties, thereby structuring all perception by relevant affordances, so solving frame problems for embodied agents. Drawing upon the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference framework, I describe a particular mechanism for intentional action selection via consciously imagined (and explicitly represented) goal realization, where contrasts between desired and present states influence ongoing policy selection via predictive coding mechanisms and backward-chained imaginings (as self-realizing predictions). This embodied developmental legacy suggests a mechanism by which imaginings can be intentionally shaped by (internalized) partially-expressed motor acts, so providing means of agentic control for attention, working memory, imagination, and behavior. I further describe the nature(s) of mental causation and self-control, and also provide an account of readiness potentials in Libet paradigms wherein conscious intentions shape causal streams leading to enaction. Finally, I provide neurophenomenological handlings of prototypical qualia including pleasure, pain, and desire in terms of self-annihilating free energy gradients via quasi-synesthetic interoceptive active inference. In brief, this manuscript is intended to illustrate how radically embodied minds may create foundations for intelligence (as capacity for learning and inference), consciousness (as somatically-grounded self-world modeling), and will (as deployment of predictive models for enacting valued goals).", "authors": [{"name": "Adam Safron", "affiliation": "Indiana University Bloomington", "orcid": "0000-0002-3102-7623"}], "year": 2019, "doi": "10.31234/osf.io/udc42", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W4243180883", "venue": null, "citation_count": 5, "references": ["openalex:W39842680", "openalex:W340651599", "openalex:W572012434", "openalex:W580788546", "openalex:W1507102473", "openalex:W1517415198", "openalex:W1524895715", "openalex:W1531730422", "openalex:W1536258620", "openalex:W1543193819", "openalex:W1558521349", "openalex:W1595242066", "openalex:W1601639694", "openalex:W1603996780", "openalex:W1607175239", "openalex:W1609597760", "openalex:W1636189349", "openalex:W1658221384", "openalex:W1799123644", "openalex:W1849553904", "openalex:W1919094054", "openalex:W1964791283", "openalex:W1968060331", "openalex:W1968435187", "openalex:W1968490092", "openalex:W1987058953", "openalex:W2001233357", "openalex:W2001284551", "openalex:W2001532157", "openalex:W2010318909", "openalex:W2011459890", "openalex:W2015813999", "openalex:W2016030371", "openalex:W2018217289", "openalex:W2020249190", "openalex:W2028838497", "openalex:W2033422410", "openalex:W2034426409", "openalex:W2036521369", "openalex:W2036919025", "openalex:W2055473086", "openalex:W2055789905", "openalex:W2056198549", "openalex:W2061183977", "openalex:W2066653668", "openalex:W2073548258", "openalex:W2079798818", "openalex:W2080378017", "openalex:W2080659194", "openalex:W2086032301", "openalex:W2086815053", "openalex:W2091867346", "openalex:W2092788046", "openalex:W2094902224", "openalex:W2098533845", "openalex:W2103934527", "openalex:W2113034208", "openalex:W2115460576", "openalex:W2116340390", "openalex:W2120079537", "openalex:W2123713131", "openalex:W2125191661", "openalex:W2144440467", "openalex:W2147008239", "openalex:W2147834809", "openalex:W2148764920", "openalex:W2149025351", "openalex:W2150375089", "openalex:W2153458627", "openalex:W2155051738", "openalex:W2155628709", "openalex:W2159844689", "openalex:W2160904769", "openalex:W2255750102", "openalex:W2306526421", "openalex:W2326588846", "openalex:W2414486637", "openalex:W2419438565", "openalex:W2489080811", "openalex:W2504931402", "openalex:W2517572465", "openalex:W2530226740", "openalex:W2532249403", "openalex:W2537240939", "openalex:W2552810632", "openalex:W2590231520", "openalex:W2609141456", "openalex:W2615389725", "openalex:W2745114629", "openalex:W2751624169", "openalex:W2754844655", "openalex:W2755877200", "openalex:W2765383588", "openalex:W2766457420", "openalex:W2790065565", "openalex:W2794561120", "openalex:W2803735852", "openalex:W2806279769", "openalex:W2808420305", "openalex:W2884485769", "openalex:W2888826999", "openalex:W2888840253", "openalex:W2901357499", "openalex:W2937655939", "openalex:W2954626430", "openalex:W2962681511", "openalex:W2963305465", "openalex:W2963851036", "openalex:W2969343193", "openalex:W2972915210", "openalex:W2977845363", "openalex:W2982498211", "openalex:W2988523110", "openalex:W2995749846", "openalex:W3008716087", "openalex:W3015919971", "openalex:W3035420228", "openalex:W3036548566", "openalex:W3036706159", "openalex:W3037369448", "openalex:W3043856481", "openalex:W3046651484", "openalex:W3112843191", "openalex:W3116889747", "openalex:W3126008551", "openalex:W3127089627", "openalex:W3134192892", "openalex:W3161700695", "openalex:W3215644068", "openalex:W4212844288", "openalex:W4213034462", "openalex:W4214953342", "openalex:W4220811164", "openalex:W4226026147", "openalex:W4229685843", "openalex:W4230056100", "openalex:W4230446842", "openalex:W4234344480", "openalex:W4237718205", "openalex:W4237960099", "openalex:W4239633104", "openalex:W4240402997", "openalex:W4248279257", "openalex:W4249609777", "openalex:W4251009746", "openalex:W4251261936", "openalex:W4409655725"], "publication_date": null}

It is shown that thermal fluctuations can drive this magnetic spin system to evolve under dynamic constraints imposed through interactions with an external environment as predicted by the neurological free energy principle and active inference. The structure is defined by two layers of magnetic nanoelements where one layer is a square Artificial Spin Ice geometry. The other magnetic layer functions as a sensory filter that mediates interaction between the external environment and the hidden Artificial Spin Ice layer. Spin dynamics displayed by the bilayer structure are shown to be well described using a continuous form of a neurological free energy principle that has been previously proposed as a high level description of certain biological neural processes.

{"title": "Predictive Processing in Cognitive Robotics: A Review", "abstract": "Abstract Predictive processing has become an influential framework in cognitive sciences. This framework turns the traditional view of perception upside down, claiming that the main flow of information processing is realized in a top-down, hierarchical manner. Furthermore, it aims at unifying perception, cognition, and action as a single inferential process. However, in the related literature, the predictive processing framework and its associated schemes, such as predictive coding, active inference, perceptual inference, and free-energy principle, tend to be used interchangeably. In the field of cognitive robotics, there is no clear-cut distinction on which schemes have been implemented and under which assumptions. In this letter, working definitions are set with the main aim of analyzing the state of the art in cognitive robotics research working under the predictive processing framework as well as some related nonrobotic models. The analysis suggests that, first, research in both cognitive robotics implementations and nonrobotic models needs to be extended to the study of how multiple exteroceptive modalities can be integrated into prediction error minimization schemes. Second, a relevant distinction found here is that cognitive robotics implementations tend to emphasize the learning of a generative model, while in nonrobotics models, it is almost absent. Third, despite the relevance for active inference, few cognitive robotics implementations examine the issues around control and whether it should result from the substitution of inverse models with proprioceptive predictions. Finally, limited attention has been placed on precision weighting and the tracking of prediction error dynamics. These mechanisms should help to explore more complex behaviors and tasks in cognitive robotics research under the predictive processing framework.", "authors": [{"name": "Alejandra Ciria", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "G.

{"title": "An aberrant precision account of autism", "abstract": "Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by problems with social-communication, restricted interests and repetitive behavior. A recent and thought-provoking article presented a normative explanation for the perceptual symptoms of autism in terms of a failure of Bayesian inference (Pellicano and Burr, 2012). In response, we suggested that when Bayesian inference is grounded in its neural instantiation-namely, predictive coding-many features of autistic perception can be attributed to aberrant precision (or beliefs about precision) within the context of hierarchical message passing in the brain (Friston et al., 2013). Here, we unpack the aberrant precision account of autism. Specifically, we consider how empirical findings-that speak directly or indirectly to neurobiological mechanisms-are consistent with the aberrant encoding of precision in autism; in particular, an imbalance of the precision ascribed to sensory evidence relative to prior beliefs.", "authors": [{"name": "Rebecca Lawson", "affiliation": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging", "orcid": "0000-0003-1228-1244"}, {"name": "Geraint Rees", "affiliation": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging", "orcid": "0000-0002-9623-7007"}, {"name": "Karl Friston", "affiliation": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging", "orcid": "0000-0001-7984-8909"}], "year": 2014, "doi": "10.3389/fnhum.2014.00302", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W2120536867", "venue": "Frontiers in Human Neuroscience", "citation_count": 635, "references": ["openalex:W1618574694", "openalex:W1963856841", "openalex:W1966342514", "openalex:W1971638449", "openalex:W1975979465", "openalex:W1976347223", "openalex:W1976644675", "openalex:W1976746860", "openalex:W1977628053", "openalex:W1979732124", "openalex:W1982518229", "openalex:W1986023481", "openalex:W1986333646", "openalex:W1988053791", "openalex:W1988209406", "openalex:W1994892978", "openalex:W1995733852", "openalex:W1997120050", "openalex:W2001896608", "openalex:W2006079595", "openalex:W2007655600", "openalex:W2010931158", "openalex:W2013554506", "openalex:W2024747286", "openalex:W2029355232", "openalex:W2030520068", "openalex:W2032680007", "openalex:W2033422410", "openalex:W2034220807", "openalex:W2037759571", "openalex:W2042881656", "openalex:W2043014431", "openalex:W2048009237", "openalex:W2050284431", "openalex:W2050997868", "openalex:W2052287752", "openalex:W2061869560", "openalex:W2062703548", "openalex:W2064254171", "openalex:W2065540111", "openalex:W2067494936", "openalex:W2068579485", "openalex:W2069030384", "openalex:W2071152089", "openalex:W2073172123", "openalex:W2077086984", "openalex:W2077986913", "openalex:W2078631866", "openalex:W2079366972", "openalex:W2079961661", "openalex:W2082404293", "openalex:W2083302393", "openalex:W2084550269", "openalex:W2088993211", "openalex:W2092202434", "openalex:W2095648136", "openalex:W2095651675", "openalex:W2096375888", "openalex:W2096962395", "openalex:W2101777433", "openalex:W2104049715", "openalex:W2105592419", "openalex:W2108333292", "openalex:W2109645417", "openalex:W2113649077", "openalex:W2114991446", "openalex:W2115467157", "openalex:W2116311105", "openalex:W2116737087", "openalex:W2116913173", "openalex:W2119667556", "openalex:W2120079537", "openalex:W2122550040", "openalex:W2123429050", "openalex:W2125191661", "openalex:W2126701055", "openalex:W2127045046", "openalex:W2127958135", "openalex:W2130309455", "openalex:W2131568512", "openalex:W2133924241", "openalex:W2136916021", "openalex:W2140471874", "openalex:W2140487181", "openalex:W2144060469", "openalex:W2148483785", "openalex:W2150456298", "openalex:W2150595122", "openalex:W2151496011", "openalex:W2151929612", "openalex:W2154562678", "openalex:W2154767575", "openalex:W2156707826", "openalex:W2157754891", "openalex:W2158972535", "openalex:W2159011576", "openalex:W2162512585", "openalex:W2167809907", "openalex:W2168650408", "openalex:W2169220559", "openalex:W2169402628", "openalex:W2170432508", "openalex:W2171056452", "openalex:W2171637084", "openalex:W2202712733", "openalex:W2394659820", "openalex:W2895415748"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Perceptions as Hypotheses: Saccades as Experiments", "abstract": "If perception corresponds to hypothesis testing (Gregory, 1980); then visual searches might be construed as experiments that generate sensory data. In this work, we explore the idea that saccadic eye movements are optimal experiments, in which data are gathered to test hypotheses or beliefs about how those data are caused. This provides a plausible model of visual search that can be motivated from the basic principles of self-organized behavior: namely, the imperative to minimize the entropy of hidden states of the world and their sensory consequences. This imperative is met if agents sample hidden states of the world efficiently. This efficient sampling of salient information can be derived in a fairly straightforward way, using approximate Bayesian inference and variational free-energy minimization. Simulations of the resulting active inference scheme reproduce sequential eye movements that are reminiscent of empirically observed saccades and provide some counterintuitive insights into the way that sensory evidence is accumulated or assimilated into beliefs about the world.", "authors": [{"name": "Karl Friston", "affiliation": "University College London", "orcid": "0000-0001-7984-8909"}, {"name": "Rick A.

{"title": "Self-organization, free energy minimization, and optimal grip on a field of affordances", "abstract": "In this paper, we set out to develop a theoretical and conceptual framework for the new field of Radical Embodied Cognitive Neuroscience. This framework should be able to integrate insights from several relevant disciplines: theory on embodied cognition, ecological psychology, phenomenology, dynamical systems theory, and neurodynamics. We suggest that the main task of Radical Embodied Cognitive Neuroscience is to investigate the phenomenon of skilled intentionality from the perspective of the self-organization of the brain-body-environment system, while doing justice to the phenomenology of skilled action. In previous work, we have characterized skilled intentionality as the organism's tendency toward an optimal grip on multiple relevant affordances simultaneously. Affordances are possibilities for action provided by the environment. In the first part of this paper, we introduce the notion of skilled intentionality and the phenomenon of responsiveness to a field of relevant affordances. Second, we use Friston's work on neurodynamics, but embed a very minimal version of his Free Energy Principle in the ecological niche of the animal. Thus amended, this principle is helpful for understanding the embeddedness of neurodynamics within the dynamics of the system \"brain-body-landscape of affordances.\" Next, we show how we can use this adjusted principle to understand the neurodynamics of selective openness to the environment: interacting action-readiness patterns at multiple timescales contribute to the organism's selective openness to relevant affordances. In the final part of the paper, we emphasize the important role of metastable dynamics in both the brain and the brain-body-environment system for adequate affordance-responsiveness. We exemplify our integrative approach by presenting research on the impact of Deep Brain Stimulation on affordance responsiveness of OCD patients.", "authors": [{"name": "Jelle Bruineberg", "affiliation": "University of Amsterdam", "orcid": "0000-0001-5675-3376"}, {"name": "Erik Rietveld", "affiliation": "University of Amsterdam", "orcid": "0000-0001-5197-142X"}], "year": 2014, "doi": "10.3389/fnhum.2014.00599", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W2115460576", "venue": "Frontiers in Human Neuroscience", "citation_count": 525, "references": ["openalex:W76312772", "openalex:W132424788", "openalex:W182590847", "openalex:W311820753", "openalex:W422023452", "openalex:W578242910", "openalex:W1215306345", "openalex:W1488897002", "openalex:W1489032534", "openalex:W1491244904", "openalex:W1534891282", "openalex:W1536255406", "openalex:W1576201103", "openalex:W1582771551", "openalex:W1711491553", "openalex:W1729777349", "openalex:W1933657216", "openalex:W1964069773", "openalex:W1967877013", "openalex:W1979732124", "openalex:W1986074397", "openalex:W1987430298", "openalex:W1990895924", "openalex:W1992903142", "openalex:W2001921661", "openalex:W2004978206", "openalex:W2008523042", "openalex:W2013354438", "openalex:W2029262927", "openalex:W2040268087", "openalex:W2042658335", "openalex:W2045403074", "openalex:W2045968845", "openalex:W2049320131", "openalex:W2049891146", "openalex:W2055473086", "openalex:W2055789905", "openalex:W2059238825", "openalex:W2062477851", "openalex:W2062555426", "openalex:W2065025088", "openalex:W2068432276", "openalex:W2087804641", "openalex:W2091795526", "openalex:W2093466600", "openalex:W2093803155", "openalex:W2095702936", "openalex:W2098534654", "openalex:W2105714874", "openalex:W2107726111", "openalex:W2113748017", "openalex:W2117228825", "openalex:W2117567750", "openalex:W2118125647", "openalex:W2124705652", "openalex:W2135869619", "openalex:W2137411342", "openalex:W2138351621", "openalex:W2146699327", "openalex:W2147008239", "openalex:W2148764920", "openalex:W2153791616", "openalex:W2154123408", "openalex:W2154634136", "openalex:W2268069650", "openalex:W2338633370", "openalex:W2553999785", "openalex:W2913167046", "openalex:W3085978853", "openalex:W3171389120", "openalex:W4214656797", "openalex:W4229972507", "openalex:W4231516052", "openalex:W4238014541", "openalex:W4242005639", "openalex:W4255580453", "openalex:W4299563156", "openalex:W6614645645", "openalex:W6629233040", "openalex:W6629326835", "openalex:W6634373811", "openalex:W6730008269"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Predicting individual learning trajectories in zebrafish via the free-energy principle", "abstract": "The free-energy principle has been proposed as a unified theory of brain function, and recent evidence from in vitro experiments supports its validity. However, its empirical application to in vivo neuronal dynamics during active decision-making remains limited. This work reverse-engineered generative models—cast as canonical neural networks—from large-scale calcium imaging data of zebrafish performing a visually guided go/no-go task in a virtual-reality environment. Leveraging the formal equivalence between neural network dynamics and variational Bayesian inference, we constructed biologically plausible synthetic agents capable of active inference. These agents recapitulated individual variability in zebrafish neuronal dynamics and behaviour by identifying subject-specific prior and posterior beliefs. Additionally, they enabled quantitative predictions of long-term changes in neural activity, effective synaptic connectivity, and behavioural performance, including task accuracy after training. Our results demonstrate a powerful framework of active inference for modelling in vivo neuronal self-organisation and highlight the predictive validity of the free-energy principle in behaving animals.", "authors": [{"name": "Takuya Isomura", "affiliation": "RIKEN Center for Brain Science", "orcid": "0000-0003-2960-4919"}, {"name": "Yuki Tanimoto", "affiliation": "Waseda University", "orcid": "0000-0002-7434-678X"}, {"name": "Makio Torigoe", "affiliation": "RIKEN Center for Brain Science", "orcid": "0000-0001-8208-4823"}, {"name": "Hitoshi Okamoto", "affiliation": "Tokyo Yamate Medical Center", "orcid": "0000-0002-7512-8549"}, {"name": "Hideaki Shimazaki", "affiliation": "Kyoto University", "orcid": "0000-0001-7794-3064"}], "year": 2025, "doi": "10.1101/2025.08.06.668947", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W4413137256", "venue": null, "citation_count": 2, "references": ["openalex:W1520415431", "openalex:W1680392829", "openalex:W1985940938", "openalex:W2009125262", "openalex:W2009375605", "openalex:W2010124835", "openalex:W2041848110", "openalex:W2057243734", "openalex:W2061191702", "openalex:W2070461647", "openalex:W2091990110", "openalex:W2092874151", "openalex:W2107362261", "openalex:W2117663940", "openalex:W2120079537", "openalex:W2143131273", "openalex:W2147008239", "openalex:W2148764920", "openalex:W2159275967", "openalex:W2168359464", "openalex:W2211598849", "openalex:W2225156818", "openalex:W2271476098", "openalex:W2479616914", "openalex:W2522169164", "openalex:W2552810632", "openalex:W2588388246", "openalex:W2595012769", "openalex:W2726920196", "openalex:W2738724892", "openalex:W2753555157", "openalex:W2753961618", "openalex:W2952777976", "openalex:W2991987583", "openalex:W3013369344", "openalex:W3087248248", "openalex:W3098156617", "openalex:W3120392574", "openalex:W4200582713", "openalex:W4205386412", "openalex:W4226023986", "openalex:W4226400653", "openalex:W4298191902", "openalex:W4321607694", "openalex:W4385630601", "openalex:W4390572244", "openalex:W4392740371", "openalex:W4399534689", "openalex:W4402740785", "openalex:W4404355049", "openalex:W4406525199", "openalex:W4407342696", "openalex:W4409283527", "openalex:W4409445233"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Mental Gravity: Depression as Spacetime Curvature of the Self, Mind, and Brain", "abstract": "The principle of mental gravity contends that the mind uses physical gravity as a mental model or simulacrum to express the relation between the inner self and the outer world in terms of “UP”-ness and “DOWN”-ness. The simulation of increased gravity characterises a continuum of mental gravity which states includes depression as the paradigmatic example of being down, low, heavy, and slow. The physics of gravity can also be used to model spacetime curvature in depression, particularly gravitational time dilation as a property of MG analogous to subjective time dilation (i.e., the slowing of temporal flow in conscious experience). The principle has profound implications for the Temporo-spatial Theory of Consciousness (TTC) with regard to temporo-spatial alignment that establishes a “world-brain relation” that is centred on embodiment and the socialisation of conscious states. The principle of mental gravity provides the TTC with a way to incorporate the structure of the world into the structure of the brain, conscious experience, and thought. In concert with other theories of cognitive and neurobiological spacetime, the TTC can also work towards the “common currency” approach that also potentially connects the TTC to predictive processing frameworks such as free energy, neuronal gauge theories, and active inference accounts of depression. It gives the up/down dimension of space, as defined by the gravitational field, a unique status that is connected to both our embodied interaction with the physical world, and also the inverse, reflective, emotional but still embodied experience of ourselves.", "authors": [{"name": "Lachlan Kent", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0002-8864-5270"}], "year": 2023, "doi": "10.3390/e25091275", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W4386290886", "venue": "Entropy", "citation_count": 4, "references": ["openalex:W86499429", "openalex:W349130485", "openalex:W771064510", "openalex:W853393540", "openalex:W877950925", "openalex:W1482829667", "openalex:W1524895715", "openalex:W1533496174", "openalex:W1614418002", "openalex:W1620203002", "openalex:W1649142435", "openalex:W1661843733", "openalex:W1975938209", "openalex:W1977272084", "openalex:W1981857186", "openalex:W1982195369", "openalex:W1992938996", "openalex:W1994296542", "openalex:W1998055240", "openalex:W2001665711", "openalex:W2007997142", "openalex:W2014736151", "openalex:W2016521818", "openalex:W2016862399", "openalex:W2018533701", "openalex:W2018969119", "openalex:W2020399013", "openalex:W2029967713", "openalex:W2030761940", "openalex:W2031268074", "openalex:W2035804753", "openalex:W2040391573", "openalex:W2052685640", "openalex:W2056416465", "openalex:W2064000597", "openalex:W2064005775", "openalex:W2066208486", "openalex:W2066875083", "openalex:W2070811300", "openalex:W2073288993", "openalex:W2074457983", "openalex:W2078915551", "openalex:W2089457241", "openalex:W2092898161", "openalex:W2100194699", "openalex:W2103125163", "openalex:W2104386846", "openalex:W2105888109", "openalex:W2116307074", "openalex:W2121358117", "openalex:W2122715295", "openalex:W2132288316", "openalex:W2132322340", "openalex:W2133485962", "openalex:W2134933549", "openalex:W2135176444", "openalex:W2138089936", "openalex:W2144421443", "openalex:W2150382179", "openalex:W2152534121", "openalex:W2158327608", "openalex:W2162493976", "openalex:W2167285812", "openalex:W2168088150", "openalex:W2168489054", "openalex:W2281647258", "openalex:W2293942407", "openalex:W2331110559", "openalex:W2336630210", "openalex:W2530226740", "openalex:W2531083186", "openalex:W2547667965", "openalex:W2562443439", "openalex:W2564787725", "openalex:W2565832912", "openalex:W2584391386", "openalex:W2607770070", "openalex:W2736021085", "openalex:W2741986628", "openalex:W2765392035", "openalex:W2767800289", "openalex:W2768062844", "openalex:W2779724198", "openalex:W2789154098", "openalex:W2789297383", "openalex:W2791077948", "openalex:W2791303902", "openalex:W2799968438", "openalex:W2809023326", "openalex:W2865697474", "openalex:W2883695535", "openalex:W2889770130", "openalex:W2895048255", "openalex:W2908555537", "openalex:W2914034534", "openalex:W2915434726", "openalex:W2924782313", "openalex:W2937552158", "openalex:W2945067895", "openalex:W2945914100", "openalex:W2966817407", "openalex:W2973077314", "openalex:W3018556804", "openalex:W3023671316", "openalex:W3046526879", "openalex:W3092674090", "openalex:W3096009341", "openalex:W3106263114", "openalex:W3111765421", "openalex:W3118505329", "openalex:W3122485369", "openalex:W3128943932", "openalex:W3164719699", "openalex:W3195898454", "openalex:W4205295262", "openalex:W4205820185", "openalex:W4210955860", "openalex:W4212971928", "openalex:W4214555486", "openalex:W4246411647", "openalex:W4280551191", "openalex:W4282964615", "openalex:W4285594368", "openalex:W4291009273", "openalex:W4298326966", "openalex:W4364376538", "openalex:W4365515021", "openalex:W4365515296", "openalex:W4366285760", "openalex:W4376117628", "openalex:W6603557769", "openalex:W6636964308", "openalex:W6771910763", "openalex:W6772218845", "openalex:W6838659637"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Reward Maximisation through Discrete Active Inference", "abstract": "Active inference is a probabilistic framework for modelling the behaviour of biological and artificial agents, which derives from the principle of minimising free energy. In recent years, this framework has successfully been applied to a variety of situations where the goal was to maximise reward, offering comparable and sometimes superior performance to alternative approaches. In this paper, we clarify the connection between reward maximisation and active inference by demonstrating how and when active inference agents perform actions that are optimal for maximising reward. Precisely, we show the conditions under which active inference produces the optimal solution to the Bellman equation--a formulation that underlies several approaches to model-based reinforcement learning and control. On partially observed Markov decision processes, the standard active inference scheme can produce Bellman optimal actions for planning horizons of 1, but not beyond. In contrast, a recently developed recursive active inference scheme (sophisticated inference) can produce Bellman optimal actions on any finite temporal horizon. We append the analysis with a discussion of the broader relationship between active inference and reinforcement learning.", "authors": [{"name": "Lancelot Da Costa", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0003-0126-4588"}, {"name": "Noor Sajid", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0003-1904-2887"}, {"name": "Thomas Parr", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0001-5108-5743"}, {"name": "Karl Friston", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0001-7984-8909"}, {"name": "Ryan Smith", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0002-4448-185X"}], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.48550/arxiv.2009.08111", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W4285652426", "venue": "arXiv (Cornell University)", "citation_count": 2, "references": [], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Active inference, sensory attenuation and illusions", "abstract": "Active inference provides a simple and neurobiologically plausible account of how action and perception are coupled in producing (Bayes) optimal behaviour. This can be seen most easily as minimising prediction error: we can either change our predictions to explain sensory input through perception. Alternatively, we can actively change sensory input to fulfil our predictions. In active inference, this action is mediated by classical reflex arcs that minimise proprioceptive prediction error created by descending proprioceptive predictions. However, this creates a conflict between action and perception; in that, self-generated movements require predictions to override the sensory evidence that one is not actually moving. However, ignoring sensory evidence means that externally generated sensations will not be perceived. Conversely, attending to (proprioceptive and somatosensory) sensations enables the detection of externally generated events but precludes generation of actions. This conflict can be resolved by attenuating the precision of sensory evidence during movement or, equivalently, attending away from the consequences of self-made acts. We propose that this Bayes optimal withdrawal of precise sensory evidence during movement is the cause of psychophysical sensory attenuation. Furthermore, it explains the force-matching illusion and reproduces empirical results almost exactly. Finally, if attenuation is removed, the force-matching illusion disappears and false (delusional) inferences about agency emerge. This is important, given the negative correlation between sensory attenuation and delusional beliefs in normal subjects--and the reduction in the magnitude of the illusion in schizophrenia. Active inference therefore links the neuromodulatory optimisation of precision to sensory attenuation and illusory phenomena during the attribution of agency in normal subjects. It also provides a functional account of deficits in syndromes characterised by false inference and impaired movement--like schizophrenia and Parkinsonism--syndromes that implicate abnormal modulatory neurotransmission.", "authors": [{"name": "Harriet R.

Current human-inspired tools include neuromorphic systems and the developmental approach to learning.

These constraints necessitate a unified framework: active inference, underpinned by the free energy principle (FEP).

{"title": "Interoception, contemplative practice, and health", "abstract": "Interoception can be broadly defined as the sense of signals originating within the body. As such, interoception is critical for our sense of embodiment, motivation, and well-being. And yet, despite its importance, interoception remains poorly understood within modern science. This paper reviews interdisciplinary perspectives on interoception, with the goal of presenting a unified perspective from diverse fields such as neuroscience, clinical practice, and contemplative studies. It is hoped that this integrative effort will advance our understanding of how interoception determines well-being, and identify the central challenges to such understanding. To this end, we introduce an expanded taxonomy of interoceptive processes, arguing that many of these processes can be understood through an emerging predictive coding model for mind-body integration. The model, which describes the tension between expected and felt body sensation, parallels contemplative theories, and implicates interoception in a variety of affective and psychosomatic disorders. We conclude that maladaptive construal of bodily sensations may lie at the heart of many contemporary maladies, and that contemplative practices may attenuate these interpretative biases, restoring a person's sense of presence and agency in the world.", "authors": [{"name": "Norman A.

{"title": "Active Inference as a Framework for Brain-Computer Interfaces", "abstract": "Abstract As Karl Friston explained during the International Symposium on Artificial Intelligence and Brain Science 2020, active inference provides a way of using abstract rule-learning and approximate Bayesian inference to show how minimizing (expected) free energy leads to active sampling of novel contingencies. Friston elaborated how there were ways of making an optimal decision using active inference that can offer perspectives to advances in artificial intelligence. These methods of optimization within the context of active inference can also be used as a framework for improving brain-computer interfaces (BCI). This way, BCIs can give rise to artificial curiosity in the way Friston had described during his session. Using Friston’s free energy principle, we can optimize the criterion a BCI uses to infer the intentions of the user from EEG observations. Under Friston’s criteria for making an optimal decision, BCIs can expand their framework of optimal decision-making using active inference.", "authors": [{"name": "Syed Hussain Ather", "affiliation": "University of Toronto", "orcid": "0000-0002-2691-5589"}], "year": 2021, "doi": "10.1101/2021.02.02.429272", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W3127448647", "venue": null, "citation_count": 1, "references": ["openalex:W1981948123", "openalex:W2014114527", "openalex:W2026292399", "openalex:W2033613103", "openalex:W2034806191", "openalex:W2052109162", "openalex:W2055789905", "openalex:W2098100592", "openalex:W2119885245", "openalex:W2123611655", "openalex:W2128918015", "openalex:W2129203136", "openalex:W2129868607", "openalex:W2130195834", "openalex:W2131153423", "openalex:W2147008239", "openalex:W2148764920", "openalex:W2297915641", "openalex:W2424475825", "openalex:W2743911451", "openalex:W2900218957", "openalex:W2920942685", "openalex:W2976973594", "openalex:W2989700500"], "publication_date": null}

{"title": "Free Energy Principle for the Noise Smoothness Estimation of Linear Systems with Colored Noise", "abstract": "The free energy principle (FEP) from neuroscience provides a framework called active inference for the joint estimation and control of state space systems, subjected to colored noise. However, the active inference community has been challenged with the critical task of manually tuning the noise smoothness parameter. To solve this problem, we introduce a novel online noise smoothness estimator based on the idea of free energy principle. We mathematically show that our estimator can converge to the free energy optimum during smoothness estimation. Using this formulation, we introduce a joint state and noise smoothness observer design called DEMs. Through rigorous simulations, we show that DEMs outperforms state-of-the-art state observers with least state estimation error. Finally, we provide a proof of concept for DEMs by applying it on a real life robotics problem - state estimation of a quadrotor hovering in wind, demonstrating its practical use.", "authors": [{"name": "Ajith Anil Meera", "affiliation": "Delft University of Technology", "orcid": "0000-0002-2310-0579"}, {"name": "Martijn Wisse", "affiliation": "Delft University of Technology", "orcid": "0000-0001-8210-7562"}], "year": 2022, "doi": "10.1109/cdc51059.2022.9992717", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W4315489014", "venue": "2022 IEEE 61st Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)", "citation_count": 1, "references": ["openalex:W1602197575", "openalex:W2000098639", "openalex:W2016625584", "openalex:W2040891197", "openalex:W2107557962", "openalex:W2113257799", "openalex:W2130195834", "openalex:W2148764920", "openalex:W2157376352", "openalex:W2171612575", "openalex:W2212828166", "openalex:W2617660370", "openalex:W2634032879", "openalex:W2919878953", "openalex:W2948283202", "openalex:W3045763022", "openalex:W3159995865", "openalex:W3201764424", "openalex:W3204374301", "openalex:W3206390677", "openalex:W3215555963", "openalex:W4200634454", "openalex:W4249210107", "openalex:W4300963681", "openalex:W6763638562", "openalex:W6801930411", "openalex:W6804360571", "openalex:W6805513666"], "publication_date": null}

{"title": "Robot manipulator control under the Active Inference framework", "abstract": "The Active Inference framework is a neuroscience theory based on the Free Energy Principle by Karl Friston that has gained considerable prominence as a general theory to explain action and perception. Despite its promising future and use in different fields, its applicability for robot control has been barely investigated in the literature so far. This thesis aims at discerning if the current Active Inference implementation can be used for the control of robot manipulators and which are the requirements to do so. Firstly, an analysis of the current implementation of robot control under the Active Inference is made to understand its accomplishments and limitations. Secondly, both offline and online control schemes under the Active Inference framework are proposed. To continue with, a low-level controller is designed to be used in the Active Inference control scheme as a prior of the robot behaviour. The performance of the designed controller and the Active Inference scheme using this controller as a prior is compared to a benchmark controller. This comparison shows that the proposed implementation of the Active Inference scheme does not perform better than the current methods, but with further research on the how to implement this scheme using a real process it may become a valid alternative to these methods. Finally, recommendations on future work are given to bring this framework to online implementations and to verify the results obtained regarding the applicability of the Active Inference framework to robot manipulator control.", "authors": [{"name": "Arnau Cibiach Mercade", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2018, "doi": null, "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W2901199445", "venue": null, "citation_count": 2, "references": [], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Active Inference as a Model of Agency", "abstract": "Is there a canonical way to think of agency beyond reward maximisation? In this paper, we show that any type of behaviour complying with physically sound assumptions about how macroscopic biological agents interact with the world canonically integrates exploration and exploitation in the sense of minimising risk and ambiguity about states of the world. This description, known as active inference, refines the free energy principle, a popular descriptive framework for action and perception originating in neuroscience. Active inference provides a normative Bayesian framework to simulate and model agency that is widely used in behavioural neuroscience, reinforcement learning (RL) and robotics. The usefulness of active inference for RL is three-fold. \\emph{a}) Active inference provides a principled solution to the exploration-exploitation dilemma that usefully simulates biological agency. \\emph{b}) It provides an explainable recipe to simulate behaviour, whence behaviour follows as an explainable mixture of exploration and exploitation under a generative world model, and all differences in behaviour are explicit in differences in world model. \\emph{c}) This framework is universal in the sense that it is theoretically possible to rewrite any RL algorithm conforming to the descriptive assumptions of active inference as an active inference algorithm. Thus, active inference can be used as a tool to uncover and compare the commitments and assumptions of more specific models of agency.", "authors": [{"name": "Lancelot Da Costa", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0003-0126-4588"}, {"name": "Samuel Tenka", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Dominic Zhao", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Noor Sajid", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0003-1904-2887"}], "year": 2024, "doi": "10.48550/arxiv.2401.12917", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W4391212805", "venue": "arXiv (Cornell University)", "citation_count": 2, "references": [], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "A Free Energy Principle for Biological Systems", "abstract": "This paper describes a free energy principle that tries to explain the ability of biological systems to resist a natural tendency to disorder. It appeals to circular causality of the sort found in synergetic formulations of self-organization (e.g., the slaving principle) and models of coupled dynamical systems, using nonlinear Fokker Planck equations. Here, circular causality is induced by separating the states of a random dynamical system into external and internal states, where external states are subject to random fluctuations and internal states are not. This reduces the problem to finding some (deterministic) dynamics of the internal states that ensure the system visits a limited number of external states; in other words, the measure of its (random) attracting set, or the Shannon entropy of the external states is small. We motivate a solution using a principle of least action based on variational free energy (from statistical physics) and establish the conditions under which it is formally equivalent to the information bottleneck method. This approach has proved useful in understanding the functional architecture of the brain. The generality of variational free energy minimisation and corresponding information theoretic formulations may speak to interesting applications beyond the neurosciences; e.g., in molecular or evolutionary biology.", "authors": [{"name": "Karl Friston", "affiliation": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging", "orcid": "0000-0001-7984-8909"}], "year": 2012, "doi": "10.3390/e14112100", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W2154123408", "venue": "Entropy", "citation_count": 383, "references": ["openalex:W2392040", "openalex:W429051271", "openalex:W1504499192", "openalex:W1515138319", "openalex:W1528946842", "openalex:W1582771551", "openalex:W1601036473", "openalex:W1871708413", "openalex:W1965555277", "openalex:W1971715144", "openalex:W1972123765", "openalex:W1973219195", "openalex:W1973243121", "openalex:W1975700187", "openalex:W1981905332", "openalex:W1983941091", "openalex:W1985162039", "openalex:W1991362484", "openalex:W1993900316", "openalex:W2003501808", "openalex:W2004978206", "openalex:W2022238029", "openalex:W2026799324", "openalex:W2032558547", "openalex:W2044386301", "openalex:W2047229728", "openalex:W2070430318", "openalex:W2070813962", "openalex:W2076618566", "openalex:W2096375888", "openalex:W2096962395", "openalex:W2101692583", "openalex:W2108020239", "openalex:W2111947800", "openalex:W2113257799", "openalex:W2113748017", "openalex:W2115979064", "openalex:W2119121444", "openalex:W2119231103", "openalex:W2119885245", "openalex:W2127958135", "openalex:W2128666650", "openalex:W2128957129", "openalex:W2130195834", "openalex:W2132003317", "openalex:W2135100787", "openalex:W2137547003", "openalex:W2141394518", "openalex:W2142176084", "openalex:W2147008239", "openalex:W2147336195", "openalex:W2148764920", "openalex:W2152742892", "openalex:W2166811440", "openalex:W2317030384", "openalex:W2411171543", "openalex:W2493894436", "openalex:W2574755693", "openalex:W2979454998", "openalex:W3022780580", "openalex:W3101747931", "openalex:W3105907531", "openalex:W4231516052", "openalex:W4237718205", "openalex:W4249210107", "openalex:W4250087930", "openalex:W4388252848", "openalex:W6637108112", "openalex:W6675149333", "openalex:W6680462918"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "As One and Many: Relating Individual and Emergent Group-Level Generative Models in Active Inference", "abstract": "Active inference under the Free Energy Principle has been proposed as an across-scales compatible framework for understanding and modelling behaviour and self-maintenance. Crucially, a collective of active inference agents can, if they maintain a group-level Markov Blanket, constitute a larger group-level active inference agent with a generative model of its own. This potential for computational, scale-free structures speaks to the application of active inference to self-organizing systems across spatiotemporal scales, from cells to human collectives. Due to the difficulty of reconstructing the generative model — that explains the behaviour — of emergent group-level agents, there has been little research on this kind of multi-scale active inference. Here, we propose a data-driven methodology for characterising the relation between the generative model of a group-level agent and the dynamics of its constituent individual agents. We apply methods from computational cognitive modelling and computational psychiatry, applicable for active inference as well as other types of modelling approaches. Using a simple multi-armed bandit task as an example, we employ the new ActiveInference.jl library for Julia to simulate a collective of agents who are equipped with a Markov blanket. We use sampling-based parameter estimation to make inferences about the generative model of the group-level agent and we show that there is a non-trivial relationship between the generative models of individual agents and the group-level agent they constitute, even in this simple setting. Finally, we point to a number of ways in which this methodology might be applied to better understand the relations between nested active inference agents across scales.", "authors": [{"name": "Peter Thestrup Waade", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0002-6061-0084"}, {"name": "C.

{"title": "World Models and Predictive Coding for Cognitive and Developmental Robotics: Frontiers and Challenges", "abstract": "Creating autonomous robots that can actively explore the environment, acquire knowledge and learn skills continuously is the ultimate achievement envisioned in cognitive and developmental robotics. Their learning processes should be based on interactions with their physical and social world in the manner of human learning and cognitive development. Based on this context, in this paper, we focus on the two concepts of world models and predictive coding. Recently, world models have attracted renewed attention as a topic of considerable interest in artificial intelligence. Cognitive systems learn world models to better predict future sensory observations and optimize their policies, i.e., controllers. Alternatively, in neuroscience, predictive coding proposes that the brain continuously predicts its inputs and adapts to model its own dynamics and control behavior in its environment. Both ideas may be considered as underpinning the cognitive development of robots and humans capable of continual or lifelong learning. Although many studies have been conducted on predictive coding in cognitive robotics and neurorobotics, the relationship between world model-based approaches in AI and predictive coding in robotics has rarely been discussed. Therefore, in this paper, we clarify the definitions, relationships, and status of current research on these topics, as well as missing pieces of world models and predictive coding in conjunction with crucially related concepts such as the free-energy principle and active inference in the context of cognitive and developmental robotics. Furthermore, we outline the frontiers and challenges involved in world models and predictive coding toward the further integration of AI and robotics, as well as the creation of robots with real cognitive and developmental capabilities in the future.", "authors": [{"name": "Tadahiro Taniguchi", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0002-5682-2076"}, {"name": "Shingo Murata", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0002-0790-1915"}, {"name": "Masahiro Suzuki", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0001-8519-5617"}, {"name": "Dimitri Ognibene", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0002-9454-680X"}, {"name": "Pablo Lanillos", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0001-9154-0798"}, {"name": "Emre Uğur", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0001-9597-2731"}, {"name": "Lorenzo Jamone", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0002-1521-6168"}, {"name": "T.

Within the normative framework of AIXI, intelligence may be understood as capacities for compressing (and thereby predicting) data and achieving goals via programs with minimal algorithmic complexity. Within the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference framework, intelligence may be understood as capacity for inference and learning of predictive models for goal-realization, with beliefs favored to the extent they fit novel data with minimal updating of priors. Most recently, consciousness has been proposed to enhance intelligent functioning by allowing for iterative state estimation of the essential variables of a system and its relationships to its environment, conditioned on a causal world model.

{"title": "Development of compositionality through interactive learning of language and action of robots", "abstract": "Humans excel at applying learned behavior to unlearned situations. A crucial component of this generalization behavior is our ability to compose/decompose a whole into reusable parts, an attribute known as compositionality. One of the fundamental questions in robotics concerns this characteristic: How can linguistic compositionality be developed concomitantly with sensorimotor skills through associative learning, particularly when individuals only learn partial linguistic compositions and their corresponding sensorimotor patterns? To address this question, we propose a brain-inspired neural network model that integrates vision, proprioception, and language into a framework of predictive coding and active inference on the basis of the free-energy principle. The effectiveness and capabilities of this model were assessed through various simulation experiments conducted with a robot arm. Our results show that generalization in learning to unlearned verb-noun compositions is significantly enhanced when training variations of task composition are increased. We attribute this to self-organized compositional structures in linguistic latent state space being influenced substantially by sensorimotor learning. Ablation studies show that visual attention and working memory are essential to accurately generate visuomotor sequences to achieve linguistically represented goals. These insights advance our understanding of mechanisms underlying development of compositionality through interactions of linguistic and sensorimotor experience.", "authors": [{"name": "Prasanna Vijayaraghavan", "affiliation": "Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University", "orcid": "0000-0002-6036-651X"}, {"name": "Jeffrey Queißer", "affiliation": "Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University", "orcid": "0000-0002-9725-6971"}, {"name": "Sergio Verduzco-Flores", "affiliation": "Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University", "orcid": "0000-0002-0712-145X"}, {"name": "Jun Tani", "affiliation": "Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University", "orcid": "0000-0002-9131-9206"}], "year": 2025, "doi": "10.1126/scirobotics.adp0751", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W4406728015", "venue": "Science Robotics", "citation_count": 6, "references": ["openalex:W817169058", "openalex:W1567378137", "openalex:W1977576450", "openalex:W2076748564", "openalex:W2096375888", "openalex:W2103104224", "openalex:W2106780544", "openalex:W2107019937", "openalex:W2115975321", "openalex:W2116653838", "openalex:W2119885245", "openalex:W2121011260", "openalex:W2130195834", "openalex:W2135891083", "openalex:W2137411342", "openalex:W2140095548", "openalex:W2143623899", "openalex:W2145097496", "openalex:W2148764920", "openalex:W2162457740", "openalex:W2171916839", "openalex:W2604838875", "openalex:W2766969803", "openalex:W2790065565", "openalex:W2808979760", "openalex:W2862846329", "openalex:W2923426270", "openalex:W2963305465", "openalex:W2974745023", "openalex:W3017374003", "openalex:W3025794913", "openalex:W3048438965", "openalex:W3093142758", "openalex:W3100675524", "openalex:W3103942687", "openalex:W3111753701", "openalex:W3127602238", "openalex:W3193512922", "openalex:W3199748991", "openalex:W4220788258", "openalex:W4229781645", "openalex:W4236637433", "openalex:W4251742697", "openalex:W4254379035", "openalex:W4312932733", "openalex:W4379347837", "openalex:W4388696164", "openalex:W4400929897"], "publication_date": null}

{"title": "Natural Language Syntax Complies with the Free-Energy Principle", "abstract": "Natural language syntax yields an unbounded array of hierarchically structured expressions. We claim that these are used in the service of active inference in accord with the free-energy principle (FEP). While conceptual advances alongside modelling and simulation work have attempted to connect speech segmentation and linguistic communication with the FEP, we extend this program to the underlying computations responsible for generating syntactic objects. We argue that recently proposed principles of economy in language design - such as \"minimal search\" criteria from theoretical syntax - adhere to the FEP. This affords a greater degree of explanatory power to the FEP - with respect to higher language functions - and offers linguistics a grounding in first principles with respect to computability. We show how both tree-geometric depth and a Kolmogorov complexity estimate (recruiting a Lempel-Ziv compression algorithm) can be used to accurately predict legal operations on syntactic workspaces, directly in line with formulations of variational free energy minimization. This is used to motivate a general principle of language design that we term Turing-Chomsky Compression (TCC). We use TCC to align concerns of linguists with the normative account of self-organization furnished by the FEP, by marshalling evidence from theoretical linguistics and psycholinguistics to ground core principles of efficient syntactic computation within active inference.", "authors": [{"name": "Elliot Murphy", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0003-1456-0343"}, {"name": "Emma Holmes", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0002-0314-6588"}, {"name": "Karl Friston", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0001-7984-8909"}], "year": 2022, "doi": "10.48550/arxiv.2210.15098", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W4307535294", "venue": "arXiv (Cornell University)", "citation_count": 2, "references": [], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Allostatic Self-efficacy: A Metacognitive Theory of Dyshomeostasis-Induced Fatigue and Depression", "abstract": "This paper outlines a hierarchical Bayesian framework for interoception, homeostatic/allostatic control, and meta-cognition that connects fatigue and depression to the experience of chronic dyshomeostasis. Specifically, viewing interoception as the inversion of a generative model of viscerosensory inputs allows for a formal definition of dyshomeostasis (as chronically enhanced surprise about bodily signals, or, equivalently, low evidence for the brain's model of bodily states) and allostasis (as a change in prior beliefs or predictions which define setpoints for homeostatic reflex arcs). Critically, we propose that the performance of interoceptive-allostatic circuitry is monitored by a metacognitive layer that updates beliefs about the brain's capacity to successfully regulate bodily states (allostatic self-efficacy). In this framework, fatigue and depression can be understood as sequential responses to the interoceptive experience of dyshomeostasis and the ensuing metacognitive diagnosis of low allostatic self-efficacy. While fatigue might represent an early response with adaptive value (cf. sickness behavior), the experience of chronic dyshomeostasis may trigger a generalized belief of low self-efficacy and lack of control (cf. learned helplessness), resulting in depression. This perspective implies alternative pathophysiological mechanisms that are reflected by differential abnormalities in the effective connectivity of circuits for interoception and allostasis. We discuss suitably extended models of effective connectivity that could distinguish these connectivity patterns in individual patients and may help inform differential diagnosis of fatigue and depression in the future.", "authors": [{"name": "Klaas Ε.

{"title": "An Overview of the Free Energy Principle and Related Research", "abstract": "Abstract The free energy principle and its corollary, the active inference framework, serve as theoretical foundations in the domain of neuroscience, explaining the genesis of intelligent behavior. This principle states that the processes of perception, learning, and decision making—within an agent—are all driven by the objective of “minimizing free energy,” evincing the following behaviors: learning and employing a generative model of the environment to interpret observations, thereby achieving perception, and selecting actions to maintain a stable preferred state and minimize the uncertainty about the environment, thereby achieving decision making. This fundamental principle can be used to explain how the brain processes perceptual information, learns about the environment, and selects actions. Two pivotal tenets are that the agent employs a generative model for perception and planning and that interaction with the world (and other agents) enhances the performance of the generative model and augments perception. With the evolution of control theory and deep learning tools, agents based on the FEP have been instantiated in various ways across different domains, guiding the design of a multitude of generative models and decision-making algorithms. This letter first introduces the basic concepts of the FEP, followed by its historical development and connections with other theories of intelligence, and then delves into the specific application of the FEP to perception and decision making, encompassing both low-dimensional simple situations and high-dimensional complex situations. It compares the FEP with model-based reinforcement learning to show that the FEP provides a better objective function. We illustrate this using numerical studies of Dreamer3 by adding expected information gain into the standard objective function. In a complementary fashion, existing reinforcement learning, and deep learning algorithms can also help implement the FEP-based agents. Finally, we discuss the various capabilities that agents need to possess in complex environments and state that the FEP can aid agents in acquiring these capabilities.", "authors": [{"name": "Zhengquan Zhang", "affiliation": "Fudan University", "orcid": "0000-0002-7347-0324"}, {"name": "Feng Xu", "affiliation": "Fudan University", "orcid": "0000-0002-7015-1467"}], "year": 2024, "doi": "10.1162/neco_a_01642", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W4392579763", "venue": "Neural Computation", "citation_count": 4, "references": ["openalex:W1524895715", "openalex:W1959608418", "openalex:W1977628053", "openalex:W1994182995", "openalex:W2026799324", "openalex:W2033422410", "openalex:W2059156134", "openalex:W2076092328", "openalex:W2096375888", "openalex:W2113257799", "openalex:W2119885245", "openalex:W2131352719", "openalex:W2132003317", "openalex:W2137411342", "openalex:W2147008239", "openalex:W2156358825", "openalex:W2225156818", "openalex:W2237059274", "openalex:W2330802087", "openalex:W2345211079", "openalex:W2552810632", "openalex:W2604292070", "openalex:W2612690371", "openalex:W2617660370", "openalex:W2623066203", "openalex:W2743911451", "openalex:W2753555157", "openalex:W2875797025", "openalex:W2913855895", "openalex:W2919878953", "openalex:W2935889419", "openalex:W2962681511", "openalex:W2976738340", "openalex:W3001808890", "openalex:W3003886363", "openalex:W3007127011", "openalex:W3008513355", "openalex:W3017302611", "openalex:W3025794913", "openalex:W3026687585", "openalex:W3031514878", "openalex:W3033196763", "openalex:W3038822267", "openalex:W3049038639", "openalex:W3081008878", "openalex:W3083918609", "openalex:W3088414180", "openalex:W3095485376", "openalex:W3096632469", "openalex:W3098156617", "openalex:W3098317736", "openalex:W3100049110", "openalex:W3100789280", "openalex:W3103942687", "openalex:W3111639715", "openalex:W3117244011", "openalex:W3118769118", "openalex:W3120701370", "openalex:W3122690883", "openalex:W3135588948", "openalex:W3139813835", "openalex:W3142707146", "openalex:W3145013517", "openalex:W3154005821", "openalex:W3154473905", "openalex:W3159995865", "openalex:W3162787663", "openalex:W3168182227", "openalex:W3181795511", "openalex:W3198198704", "openalex:W3201689285", "openalex:W4200634454", "openalex:W4206297508", "openalex:W4207021923", "openalex:W4212774754", "openalex:W4212811802", "openalex:W4229063633", "openalex:W4236754227", "openalex:W4288101718", "openalex:W4299515571", "openalex:W4304695089", "openalex:W4308965146", "openalex:W4315705812", "openalex:W4315706776", "openalex:W4352976800", "openalex:W4352976818", "openalex:W4365515296", "openalex:W4385630601", "openalex:W6669203465", "openalex:W6682671827", "openalex:W6743446608", "openalex:W6770853193", "openalex:W6771974586", "openalex:W6773682236", "openalex:W6777146863", "openalex:W6779175359", "openalex:W6785137750", "openalex:W6791098498", "openalex:W6791314693", "openalex:W6802806350", "openalex:W6854843314"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Attention and Conscious Perception in the Hypothesis Testing Brain", "abstract": "Conscious perception and attention are difficult to study, partly because their relation to each other is not fully understood. Rather than conceiving and studying them in isolation form each other it may be useful to locate them in an independently motivated, general framework, from which a principled account of how they relate can then transpire. Accordingly, these mental phenomena are here reviewed through the prism of the increasingly influential predictive coding framework. On this framework, conscious perception can be seen as the upshot of prediction error minimisation and attention as the optimisation of precision expectations during such perceptual inference. This approach maps on well to a range of standard characteristics of conscious perception and attention, and can be used to explain a range of empirical findings on their relation to each other.", "authors": [{"name": "Jakob Hohwy", "affiliation": "Monash University", "orcid": "0000-0003-3906-3060"}], "year": 2012, "doi": "10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00096", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W1967826667", "venue": "Frontiers in Psychology", "citation_count": 413, "references": ["openalex:W86076975", "openalex:W1528946842", "openalex:W1571895365", "openalex:W1591422284", "openalex:W1597932157", "openalex:W1752759862", "openalex:W1853247995", "openalex:W1886566035", "openalex:W1966342514", "openalex:W1967817087", "openalex:W1969330856", "openalex:W1977628053", "openalex:W1991362484", "openalex:W1995616479", "openalex:W1995867794", "openalex:W2004907500", "openalex:W2017040534", "openalex:W2022781591", "openalex:W2030753578", "openalex:W2031650972", "openalex:W2032743424", "openalex:W2033613103", "openalex:W2038991910", "openalex:W2047192086", "openalex:W2049236887", "openalex:W2049524306", "openalex:W2052841394", "openalex:W2054226260", "openalex:W2055570159", "openalex:W2055862894", "openalex:W2056046632", "openalex:W2070813962", "openalex:W2070902649", "openalex:W2075117230", "openalex:W2083014579", "openalex:W2085663684", "openalex:W2095648136", "openalex:W2096652090", "openalex:W2096962395", "openalex:W2098231867", "openalex:W2099169325", "openalex:W2099679614", "openalex:W2103739933", "openalex:W2104649823", "openalex:W2107805450", "openalex:W2107890688", "openalex:W2108625229", "openalex:W2111947800", "openalex:W2111990464", "openalex:W2113820953", "openalex:W2116533103", "openalex:W2118051999", "openalex:W2118615399", "openalex:W2119667556", "openalex:W2120449116", "openalex:W2122249653", "openalex:W2127531110", "openalex:W2127958135", "openalex:W2128676863", "openalex:W2135354504", "openalex:W2136997924", "openalex:W2137411342", "openalex:W2141912078", "openalex:W2142796031", "openalex:W2144016834", "openalex:W2144608574", "openalex:W2148331243", "openalex:W2148764920", "openalex:W2149095485", "openalex:W2153098120", "openalex:W2156959828", "openalex:W2157376352", "openalex:W2157754891", "openalex:W2159288231", "openalex:W2164446969", "openalex:W2166876238", "openalex:W2169115591", "openalex:W2171916839", "openalex:W2409876466", "openalex:W2585903100", "openalex:W2751379301", "openalex:W2804155104", "openalex:W2978315572", "openalex:W4229685843", "openalex:W4232347407", "openalex:W4232589280", "openalex:W4236848939", "openalex:W4238430326", "openalex:W4249609777", "openalex:W4250194384", "openalex:W4321429439", "openalex:W4388319002", "openalex:W6629769997", "openalex:W6630141279", "openalex:W6635360447", "openalex:W6636009472", "openalex:W6637640463", "openalex:W6639536160", "openalex:W6642425394", "openalex:W6642595836", "openalex:W6655975375", "openalex:W6658299349", "openalex:W6659105928", "openalex:W6660208821", "openalex:W6662616561", "openalex:W6662906795", "openalex:W6664202716", "openalex:W6668399020", "openalex:W6674126358", "openalex:W6675641762", "openalex:W6675903101", "openalex:W6676391669", "openalex:W6676695175", "openalex:W6677279040", "openalex:W6678575826", "openalex:W6679123138", "openalex:W6679917587", "openalex:W6682366126", "openalex:W6683039678", "openalex:W6683961135", "openalex:W6684324104", "openalex:W6743412012", "openalex:W6768490725", "openalex:W6850037623", "openalex:W7036912993", "openalex:W7047002149", "openalex:W7074614240"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Uncertainty in perception and the Hierarchical Gaussian Filter", "abstract": "In its full sense, perception rests on an agent's model of how its sensory input comes about and the inferences it draws based on this model. These inferences are necessarily uncertain. Here, we illustrate how the Hierarchical Gaussian Filter (HGF) offers a principled and generic way to deal with the several forms that uncertainty in perception takes. The HGF is a recent derivation of one-step update equations from Bayesian principles that rests on a hierarchical generative model of the environment and its (in)stability. It is computationally highly efficient, allows for online estimates of hidden states, and has found numerous applications to experimental data from human subjects. In this paper, we generalize previous descriptions of the HGF and its account of perceptual uncertainty. First, we explicitly formulate the extension of the HGF's hierarchy to any number of levels; second, we discuss how various forms of uncertainty are accommodated by the minimization of variational free energy as encoded in the update equations; third, we combine the HGF with decision models and demonstrate the inversion of this combination; finally, we report a simulation study that compared four optimization methods for inverting the HGF/decision model combination at different noise levels. These four methods (Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm, Gaussian process-based global optimization, variational Bayes and Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling) all performed well even under considerable noise, with variational Bayes offering the best combination of efficiency and informativeness of inference. Our results demonstrate that the HGF provides a principled, flexible, and efficient-but at the same time intuitive-framework for the resolution of perceptual uncertainty in behaving agents.", "authors": [{"name": "Christoph Mathys", "affiliation": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging", "orcid": "0000-0003-4079-5453"}, {"name": "Ekaterina I.

{"title": "The graphical brain: Belief propagation and active inference", "abstract": "This paper considers functional integration in the brain from a computational perspective. We ask what sort of neuronal message passing is mandated by active inference—and what implications this has for context-sensitive connectivity at microscopic and macroscopic levels. In particular, we formulate neuronal processing as belief propagation under deep generative models. Crucially, these models can entertain both discrete and continuous states, leading to distinct schemes for belief updating that play out on the same (neuronal) architecture. Technically, we use Forney (normal) factor graphs to elucidate the requisite message passing in terms of its form and scheduling. To accommodate mixed generative models (of discrete and continuous states), one also has to consider link nodes or factors that enable discrete and continuous representations to talk to each other. When mapping the implicit computational architecture onto neuronal connectivity, several interesting features emerge. For example, Bayesian model averaging and comparison, which link discrete and continuous states, may be implemented in thalamocortical loops. These and other considerations speak to a computational connectome that is inherently state dependent and self-organizing in ways that yield to a principled (variational) account. We conclude with simulations of reading that illustrate the implicit neuronal message passing, with a special focus on how discrete (semantic) representations inform, and are informed by, continuous (visual) sampling of the sensorium.", "authors": [{"name": "Karl Friston", "affiliation": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging", "orcid": "0000-0001-7984-8909"}, {"name": "Thomas Parr", "affiliation": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging", "orcid": "0000-0001-5108-5743"}, {"name": "Bert de Vries", "affiliation": "Eindhoven University of Technology", "orcid": null}], "year": 2017, "doi": "10.1162/netn_a_00018", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W2623066203", "venue": "Network Neuroscience", "citation_count": 410, "references": ["openalex:W81409850", "openalex:W188781509", "openalex:W1481764136", "openalex:W1504499192", "openalex:W1524895715", "openalex:W1549987057", "openalex:W1602644359", "openalex:W1603903339", "openalex:W1620203002", "openalex:W1934021597", "openalex:W1973845142", "openalex:W1976284302", "openalex:W1977628053", "openalex:W1980619664", "openalex:W1982748320", "openalex:W1986065278", "openalex:W1991362484", "openalex:W1992230893", "openalex:W1992987050", "openalex:W1993665893", "openalex:W1995920481", "openalex:W1998651249", "openalex:W2000576846", "openalex:W2001863269", "openalex:W2002453029", "openalex:W2004978206", "openalex:W2005441736", "openalex:W2006570783", "openalex:W2008459347", "openalex:W2022238029", "openalex:W2027063265", "openalex:W2033422410", "openalex:W2033965963", "openalex:W2039546655", "openalex:W2040884624", "openalex:W2041441429", "openalex:W2043394513", "openalex:W2047347093", "openalex:W2047990541", "openalex:W2048009237", "openalex:W2055789905", "openalex:W2059156134", "openalex:W2066835186", "openalex:W2070765152", "openalex:W2073325183", "openalex:W2073840350", "openalex:W2075514521", "openalex:W2076214212", "openalex:W2076674596", "openalex:W2081402846", "openalex:W2081529557", "openalex:W2085582801", "openalex:W2085851893", "openalex:W2085989895", "openalex:W2090544951", "openalex:W2091536100", "openalex:W2091990110", "openalex:W2092874151", "openalex:W2093466600", "openalex:W2095087224", "openalex:W2096629297", "openalex:W2098580305", "openalex:W2104731571", "openalex:W2107280169", "openalex:W2109844392", "openalex:W2111947800", "openalex:W2113263087", "openalex:W2115990221", "openalex:W2116533103", "openalex:W2119885245", "openalex:W2120079537", "openalex:W2120529907", "openalex:W2123611655", "openalex:W2127918219", "openalex:W2136675476", "openalex:W2137813581", "openalex:W2139295975", "openalex:W2139701068", "openalex:W2142373488", "openalex:W2143885952", "openalex:W2144978822", "openalex:W2146141169", "openalex:W2147008239", "openalex:W2147782383", "openalex:W2151496011", "openalex:W2153791616", "openalex:W2158065370", "openalex:W2159080219", "openalex:W2159282459", "openalex:W2169415915", "openalex:W2170702893", "openalex:W2170814877", "openalex:W2171523413", "openalex:W2172463260", "openalex:W2180254922", "openalex:W2256669593", "openalex:W2290046961", "openalex:W2298354499", "openalex:W2329323183", "openalex:W2403125938", "openalex:W2424475825", "openalex:W2545581354", "openalex:W2547057105", "openalex:W2552810632", "openalex:W2562554626", "openalex:W2604086949", "openalex:W2623066203", "openalex:W2950279330", "openalex:W3147260715", "openalex:W4240947882", "openalex:W4241221200", "openalex:W4249210107", "openalex:W6678209274"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Dopamine, Affordance and Active Inference", "abstract": "The role of dopamine in behaviour and decision-making is often cast in terms of reinforcement learning and optimal decision theory. Here, we present an alternative view that frames the physiology of dopamine in terms of Bayes-optimal behaviour. In this account, dopamine controls the precision or salience of (external or internal) cues that engender action. In other words, dopamine balances bottom-up sensory information and top-down prior beliefs when making hierarchical inferences (predictions) about cues that have affordance. In this paper, we focus on the consequences of changing tonic levels of dopamine firing using simulations of cued sequential movements. Crucially, the predictions driving movements are based upon a hierarchical generative model that infers the context in which movements are made. This means that we can confuse agents by changing the context (order) in which cues are presented. These simulations provide a (Bayes-optimal) model of contextual uncertainty and set switching that can be quantified in terms of behavioural and electrophysiological responses. Furthermore, one can simulate dopaminergic lesions (by changing the precision of prediction errors) to produce pathological behaviours that are reminiscent of those seen in neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease. We use these simulations to demonstrate how a single functional role for dopamine at the synaptic level can manifest in different ways at the behavioural level.", "authors": [{"name": "Karl Friston", "affiliation": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging", "orcid": "0000-0001-7984-8909"}, {"name": "Tamara Shiner", "affiliation": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging", "orcid": "0000-0002-6368-9656"}, {"name": "Thomas H.

{"title": "Free Energy Principle for the Noise Smoothness Estimation of Linear Systems with Colored Noise", "abstract": "The free energy principle (FEP) from neuroscience provides a framework called active inference for the joint estimation and control of state space systems, subjected to colored noise. However, the active inference community has been challenged with the critical task of manually tuning the noise smoothness parameter. To solve this problem, we introduce a novel online noise smoothness estimator based on the idea of free energy principle. We mathematically show that our estimator can converge to the free energy optimum during smoothness estimation. Using this formulation, we introduce a joint state and noise smoothness observer design called DEMs. Through rigorous simulations, we show that DEMs outperforms state-of-the-art state observers with least state estimation error. Finally, we provide a proof of concept for DEMs by applying it on a real life robotics problem - state estimation of a quadrotor hovering in wind, demonstrating its practical use.", "authors": [{"name": "Ajith Anil Meera", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0002-2310-0579"}, {"name": "Martijn Wisse", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0001-8210-7562"}], "year": 2022, "doi": "10.48550/arxiv.2204.01796", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W4224903345", "venue": "arXiv (Cornell University)", "citation_count": 1, "references": [], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Real-World Robot Control Based on Contrastive Deep Active Inference With Demonstrations", "abstract": "Despite significant advances in robotics and deep learning, the ability of robots to perceive and act remain far below that of humans. To bridge this gap, we utilize active inference, a framework based on the free-energy principle that accounts for various human brain functions. Despite the utility of active inference, most previous studies have focused on simulated or real-world environments with low-dimensional observations. Therefore, direct applications in real-world robotics with high-dimensional observation and action spaces remain a challenge. To address this issue, we combine the active inference framework with contrastive learning and develop an extension by introducing learning from demonstration. This framework comprises a world model, an action model, and an expected free-energy model. The world model ensures an adequate perception of the environment by minimizing contrastive variational free energy. Meanwhile, the expected free-energy model estimates the contrastive expected free energy, while the action model generates adaptive actions by learning from demonstrations, with the aim of minimizing the estimates provided by the expected free-energy model. We show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework through image-based robotic reaching tasks in both learned and unlearned real-world environments. As a result, while the baselines achieved a success rate of up to approximately 71%, the proposed framework achieved a success rate of around 96%. Moreover, the proposed framework realized performance improvements by leveraging estimated expected free energy for action selection.

In particular, we extend current formulations of the brain as an organ of inference—based upon hierarchical predictive coding—and consider how these inferences are orchestrated. In other words, what would the brain require to dynamically coordinate and contextualize its message passing to optimize its computational goals? The answer that emerges rests on the delicate (modulatory) gain control of neuronal populations that select and coordinate (prediction error) signals that ascend cortical hierarchies. This is important because it speaks to a hierarchical anatomy of extrinsic (between region) connections that form two distinct classes, namely a class of driving (first-order) connections that are concerned with encoding the content of neuronal representations and a class of modulatory (second-order) connections that establish context—in the form of the salience or precision ascribed to content. We explore the implications of this distinction from a formal perspective (using simulations of feature–ground segregation) and consider the neurobiological substrates of the ensuing precision-engineered dynamics, with a special focus on the pulvinar and attention.", "authors": [{"name": "Ryota Kanai", "affiliation": "University of Sussex", "orcid": "0000-0002-0186-2687"}, {"name": "Yutaka Komura", "affiliation": "Japan Science and Technology Agency", "orcid": null}, {"name": "Stewart Shipp", "affiliation": "University College London", "orcid": "0000-0002-6703-2352"}, {"name": "Karl Friston", "affiliation": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging", "orcid": "0000-0001-7984-8909"}], "year": 2015, "doi": "10.1098/rstb.2014.0169", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W1973845142", "venue": "Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B Biological Sciences", "citation_count": 443, "references": ["openalex:W34287105", "openalex:W188781509", "openalex:W379488513", "openalex:W1504499192", "openalex:W1528946842", "openalex:W1574056453", "openalex:W1970798847", "openalex:W1971976749", "openalex:W1975700187", "openalex:W1976689920", "openalex:W1977628053", "openalex:W1979732124", "openalex:W1984001074", "openalex:W1985368528", "openalex:W1991362484", "openalex:W1995920481", "openalex:W1996197465", "openalex:W2002299908", "openalex:W2003723368", "openalex:W2008275505", "openalex:W2010931698", "openalex:W2012180101", "openalex:W2013554506", "openalex:W2022152471", "openalex:W2022704107", "openalex:W2024415031", "openalex:W2026799324", "openalex:W2030440331", "openalex:W2033422410", "openalex:W2033965963", "openalex:W2045823207", "openalex:W2046154593", "openalex:W2046451366", "openalex:W2048009237", "openalex:W2050506578", "openalex:W2053886595", "openalex:W2054508155", "openalex:W2055473086", "openalex:W2056452833", "openalex:W2062652125", "openalex:W2065292719", "openalex:W2067463092", "openalex:W2072977581", "openalex:W2073159385", "openalex:W2082816202", "openalex:W2082828612", "openalex:W2083993913", "openalex:W2090263161", "openalex:W2093640201", "openalex:W2095087224", "openalex:W2096470434", "openalex:W2096962395", "openalex:W2104346961", "openalex:W2104731571", "openalex:W2105665089", "openalex:W2107566414", "openalex:W2108301231", "openalex:W2109471230", "openalex:W2111177605", "openalex:W2112479070", "openalex:W2112575206", "openalex:W2113798640", "openalex:W2119885245", "openalex:W2120079537", "openalex:W2125663122", "openalex:W2137547003", "openalex:W2140487181", "openalex:W2147008239", "openalex:W2147782383", "openalex:W2148545198", "openalex:W2153791616", "openalex:W2157787057", "openalex:W2160996295", "openalex:W2170181995", "openalex:W2170814877", "openalex:W2171523413", "openalex:W2295455646", "openalex:W4210450701", "openalex:W4247883378", "openalex:W4249210107"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "The anatomy of choice: active inference and agency", "abstract": "This paper considers agency in the setting of embodied or active inference. In brief, we associate a sense of agency with prior beliefs about action and ask what sorts of beliefs underlie optimal behavior. In particular, we consider prior beliefs that action minimizes the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between desired states and attainable states in the future. This allows one to formulate bounded rationality as approximate Bayesian inference that optimizes a free energy bound on model evidence. We show that constructs like expected utility, exploration bonuses, softmax choice rules and optimism bias emerge as natural consequences of this formulation. Previous accounts of active inference have focused on predictive coding and Bayesian filtering schemes for minimizing free energy. Here, we consider variational Bayes as an alternative scheme that provides formal constraints on the computational anatomy of inference and action-constraints that are remarkably consistent with neuroanatomy. Furthermore, this scheme contextualizes optimal decision theory and economic (utilitarian) formulations as pure inference problems. For example, expected utility theory emerges as a special case of free energy minimization, where the sensitivity or inverse temperature (of softmax functions and quantal response equilibria) has a unique and Bayes-optimal solution-that minimizes free energy. This sensitivity corresponds to the precision of beliefs about behavior, such that attainable goals are afforded a higher precision or confidence. In turn, this means that optimal behavior entails a representation of confidence about outcomes that are under an agent's control.", "authors": [{"name": "Karl Friston", "affiliation": "University College London", "orcid": "0000-0001-7984-8909"}, {"name": "Philipp Schwartenbeck", "affiliation": "University College London", "orcid": "0000-0001-8943-9965"}, {"name": "Thomas H.

Understanding how such self-organizing dynamics emerge from first principles is crucial for advancing our understanding of neuronal computations and the design of artificial intelligence systems. Here we formalize how attractor networks emerge from the free energy principle applied to a universal partitioning of random dynamical systems. Our approach obviates the need for explicitly imposed learning and inference rules and identifies emergent, but efficient and biologically plausible inference and learning dynamics for such self-organizing systems. These result in a collective, multi-level Bayesian active inference process. Attractors on the free energy landscape encode prior beliefs; inference integrates sensory data into posterior beliefs; and learning fine-tunes couplings to minimize long-term surprise. Analytically and via simulations, we establish that the proposed networks favor approximately orthogonalized attractor representations, a consequence of simultaneously optimizing predictive accuracy and model complexity. These attractors efficiently span the input subspace, enhancing generalization and the mutual information between hidden causes and observable effects. Furthermore, while random data presentation leads to symmetric and sparse couplings, sequential data fosters asymmetric couplings and non-equilibrium steady-state dynamics, offering a natural extension to conventional Boltzmann Machines.

{"title": "Sophisticated Inference", "abstract": "Active inference offers a first principle account of sentient behaviour, from which special and important cases can be derived, e.g., reinforcement learning, active learning, Bayes optimal inference, Bayes optimal design, etc. Active inference resolves the exploitation-exploration dilemma in relation to prior preferences, by placing information gain on the same footing as reward or value. In brief, active inference replaces value functions with functionals of (Bayesian) beliefs, in the form of an expected (variational) free energy. In this paper, we consider a sophisticated kind of active inference, using a recursive form of expected free energy. Sophistication describes the degree to which an agent has beliefs about beliefs. We consider agents with beliefs about the counterfactual consequences of action for states of affairs and beliefs about those latent states. In other words, we move from simply considering beliefs about 'what would happen if I did that' to 'what would I believe about what would happen if I did that'. The recursive form of the free energy functional effectively implements a deep tree search over actions and outcomes in the future. Crucially, this search is over sequences of belief states, as opposed to states per se. We illustrate the competence of this scheme, using numerical simulations of deep decision problems.", "authors": [{"name": "Karl Friston", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0001-7984-8909"}, {"name": "Lancelot Da Costa", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0003-0126-4588"}, {"name": "Danijar Hafner", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0002-9534-7271"}, {"name": "Casper Hesp", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0001-7669-4078"}, {"name": "Thomas Parr", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0001-5108-5743"}], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.48550/arxiv.2006.04120", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W4287761019", "venue": "arXiv (Cornell University)", "citation_count": 1, "references": [], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Active Inference for Autonomous Decision-Making with Contextual Multi-Armed Bandits", "abstract": "In autonomous robotic decision-making under uncertainty, the tradeoff between exploitation and exploration of available options must be considered. If secondary information associated with options can be utilized, such decision-making problems can often be formulated as contextual multi-armed bandits (CMABs). In this study, we apply active inference, which has been actively studied in the field of neuroscience in recent years, as an alternative action selection strategy for CMABs. Unlike conventional action selection strategies, it is possible to rigorously evaluate the uncertainty of each option when calculating the expected free energy (EFE) associated with the decision agent's probabilistic model, as derived from the free-energy principle. We specifically address the case where a categorical observation likelihood function is used, such that EFE values are analytically intractable. We introduce new approximation methods for computing the EFE based on variational and Laplace approximations. Extensive simulation study results demonstrate that, compared to other strategies, active inference generally requires far fewer iterations to identify optimal options and generally achieves superior cumulative regret, for relatively low extra computational cost.", "authors": [{"name": "Shohei Wakayama", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0009-0009-1058-8366"}, {"name": "Nisar Ahmed", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0002-7555-5671"}], "year": 2022, "doi": "10.48550/arxiv.2209.09185", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W4296563457", "venue": "arXiv (Cornell University)", "citation_count": 1, "references": [], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Integrated World Modeling Theory (IWMT) Revisited", "abstract": "Here, I provide clarifications and discuss further issues relating to Safron (2020), “An Integrated World Modeling Theory (IWMT) of consciousness: Combining Integrated Information and Global Workspace Theories with the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference Framework; towards solving the Hard problem and characterizing agentic causation.” As a synthesis of major theories of complex systems and consciousness, with IWMT we may be able to address some of the most difficult problems in the sciences. This is a claim deserving of close scrutiny and much skepticism. What would it take to solve the Hard problem? One could answer the question of how it is possible that something like subjectivity could emerge from objective brain functioning (i.e., moving from a third person to a first person ontology), but a truly satisfying account might still require solving all the “easy” and “real” problems of consciousness. In this way, IWMT does not claim to definitively solve the Hard problem, as explaining all the particular ways that things feel across all relevant aspects of experience is likely an impossible task. Nonetheless, IWMT does claim to have made major inroads into our understanding of consciousness, and here I will attempt to justify this position by discussing challenging problems and outstanding questions with respect to philosophy, (neuro)phenomenology, computational principles, practical applications, and implications for existing theories of mind and life.", "authors": [{"name": "Adam

{"title": "Form, function, mind: What doesn't compute (and what might)", "abstract": "The applicability of computational and dynamical systems models to organisms is scrutinized, using examples from developmental biology and cognition. Developmental morphogenesis is dependent on the inherent material properties of developing animal (metazoan) tissues, a non-computational modality, but cell differentiation, which utilizes chromatin-based revisable memory banks and program-like function-calling, via the developmental gene co-expression system unique to the metazoans, has a quasi-computational basis. Multi-attractor dynamical models are argued to be misapplied to global properties of development, and it is suggested that along with computationalism, classic forms of dynamicism are similarly unsuitable to accounting for cognitive phenomena. Proposals are made for treating brains and other nervous tissues as novel forms of excitable matter with inherent properties which enable the intensification of cell-based basal cognition capabilities present throughout the tree of life. Finally, some connections are drawn between the viewpoint described here and active inference models of cognition, such as the Free Energy Principle.", "authors": [{"name": "Stuart A.

{"title": "The dark room problem in predictive processing and active inference, a legacy of cognitivism?", "abstract": "The free energy principle describes cognitive functions such as perception, action, learning and attention in terms of surprisal minimisation. Under simplifying assumptions, agents are depicted as systems minimising a weighted sum of prediction errors encoding the mismatch between incoming sensations and an agent's predictions about such sensations. The ``dark room'' is defined as a state that an agent would occupy should it only look to minimise this sum of prediction errors. This (paradoxical) state emerges as the contrast between the attempts to describe the richness of human and animal behaviour in terms of surprisal minimisation and the trivial solution of a dark room, where the complete lack of sensory stimuli would provide the easiest way to minimise prediction errors, i.e., to be in a perfectly predictable state of darkness with no incoming stimuli. Using a process theory derived from the free energy principle, active inference, we investigate with an agent-based model the meaning of the dark room problem and discuss some of its implications for natural and artificial systems. In this set up, we propose that the presence of this paradox is primarily due to the long-standing belief that agents should encode accurate world models, typical of traditional (computational) theories of cognition.", "authors": [{"name": "Manuel Baltieri", "affiliation": "University of Sussex", "orcid": "0000-0002-6086-4711"}, {"name": "Christopher D.

{"title": "Prediction, cognition and the brain", "abstract": "The term \"predictive brain\" depicts one of the most relevant concepts in cognitive neuroscience which emphasizes the importance of \"looking into the future\", namely prediction, preparation, anticipation, prospection or expectations in various cognitive domains. Analogously, it has been suggested that predictive processing represents one of the fundamental principles of neural computations and that errors of prediction may be crucial for driving neural and cognitive processes as well as behavior. This review discusses research areas which have recognized the importance of prediction and introduces the relevant terminology and leading theories in the field in an attempt to abstract some generative mechanisms of predictive processing. Furthermore, we discuss the process of testing the validity of postulated expectations by matching these to the realized events and compare the subsequent processing of events which confirm to those which violate the initial predictions. We conclude by suggesting that, although a lot is known about this type of processing, there are still many open issues which need to be resolved before a unified theory of predictive processing can be postulated with regard to both cognitive and neural functioning.", "authors": [{"name": "Andreja Bubić", "affiliation": "Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences", "orcid":

{"title": "Exploring action-oriented models via active inference for autonomous vehicles", "abstract": "Abstract Being able to robustly interact with and navigate a dynamic environment has been a long-standing challenge in intelligent transportation systems. Autonomous agents can use models that mimic the human brain to learn how to respond to other participants’ actions in the environment and proactively coordinate with the dynamics. Modeling brain learning procedures is challenging for multiple reasons, such as stochasticity, multimodality, and unobservant intents. Active inference may be defined as the Bayesian modeling of a brain with a biologically plausible model of the agent. Its primary idea relies on the free energy principle and the prior preference of the agent. It enables the agent to choose an action that leads to its preferred future observations. An exploring action-oriented model is introduced to address the inference complexity and solve the exploration–exploitation dilemma in unobserved environments. It is conducted by adapting active inference to an imitation learning approach and finding a theoretical connection between them. We present a multimodal self-awareness architecture for autonomous driving systems where the proposed techniques are evaluated on their ability to model proper driving behavior. Experimental results provide the basis for the intelligent driving system to make more human-like decisions and improve agent performance to avoid a collision.", "authors": [{"name": "Sheida Nozari", "affiliation": "University of Genoa", "orcid": "0000-0002-7767-6178"}, {"name": "Ali Krayani", "affiliation": "University of Genoa", "orcid": "0000-0002-6598-2805"}, {"name": "Pablo Marín", "affiliation": "Universidad Carlos III de Madrid", "orcid": "0000-0001-7196-434X"}, {"name": "Lucio Marcenaro", "affiliation": "University of Genoa", "orcid": "0000-0003-1515-120X"}, {"name": "David Martín", "affiliation": "Universidad Carlos III de Madrid", "orcid": "0000-0003-3764-5083"}, {"name": "Carlo S.

{"title": "Controlling the Sense of Agency in Dyadic Robot Interaction: An Active Inference Approach.", "abstract": "This study investigated how social interaction among robotic agents changes dynamically depending on individual sense of agency. In a set of simulation studies, we examine dyadic imitative interactions of robots using a variational recurrent neural network model. The model is based on the free energy principle such that interacting robots find themselves in a loop, attempting to predict and infer each other's actions using active inference. We examined how regulating the complexity term to minimize free energy during training determines the dynamic characteristics of networks and affects dyadic imitative interactions. Our simulation results show that through softer regulation of the complexity term, a robot with stronger agency develops and dominates its counterpart developed with weaker agency through tighter regulation. When two robots are trained with equally soft regulation, both generate individual intended behavior patterns, ignoring each other. We argue that primary intersubjectivity does develop in dyadic robotic interactions.", "authors": [{"name": "Nadine Wirkuttis", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0003-3217-944X"}, {"name": "Jun Tani", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0002-9131-9206"}], "year": 2021, "doi": null, "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W3135345398", "venue": "arXiv (Cornell University)", "citation_count": 2, "references": ["openalex:W34686378", "openalex:W2025575849", "openalex:W2028418738", "openalex:W2032179398", "openalex:W2045317647", "openalex:W2103460252", "openalex:W2120591602", "openalex:W2120886575", "openalex:W2127958135", "openalex:W2128483493", "openalex:W2345211079", "openalex:W2541661271", "openalex:W2567659977", "openalex:W2791067024", "openalex:W2801487100", "openalex:W2959105467", "openalex:W2974745023", "openalex:W2978417885", "openalex:W3037390745", "openalex:W3101413036"], "publication_date": null}

{"title": "A predictive processing theory of sensorimotor contingencies: Explaining the puzzle of perceptual presence and its absence in synesthesia", "abstract": "Normal perception involves experiencing objects within perceptual scenes as real, as existing in the world. This property of \"perceptual presence\" has motivated \"sensorimotor theories\" which understand perception to involve the mastery of sensorimotor contingencies. However, the mechanistic basis of sensorimotor contingencies and their mastery has remained unclear. Sensorimotor theory also struggles to explain instances of perception, such as synesthesia, that appear to lack perceptual presence and for which relevant sensorimotor contingencies are difficult to identify. On alternative \"predictive processing\" theories, perceptual content emerges from probabilistic inference on the external causes of sensory signals, however, this view has addressed neither the problem of perceptual presence nor synesthesia. Here, I describe a theory of predictive perception of sensorimotor contingencies which (1) accounts for perceptual presence in normal perception, as well as its absence in synesthesia, and (2) operationalizes the notion of sensorimotor contingencies and their mastery. The core idea is that generative models underlying perception incorporate explicitly counterfactual elements related to how sensory inputs would change on the basis of a broad repertoire of possible actions, even if those actions are not performed. These \"counterfactually-rich\" generative models encode sensorimotor contingencies related to repertoires of sensorimotor dependencies, with counterfactual richness determining the degree of perceptual presence associated with a stimulus. While the generative models underlying normal perception are typically counterfactually rich (reflecting a large repertoire of possible sensorimotor dependencies), those underlying synesthetic concurrents are hypothesized to be counterfactually poor. In addition to accounting for the phenomenology of synesthesia, the theory naturally accommodates phenomenological differences between a range of experiential states including dreaming, hallucination, and the like. It may also lead to a new view of the (in)determinacy of normal perception.", "authors": [{"name": "Anil K.

{"title": "Associative Learning and Active Inference", "abstract": "Abstract Associative learning is a behavioral phenomenon in which individuals develop connections between stimuli or events based on their co-occurrence. Initially studied by Pavlov in his conditioning experiments, the fundamental principles of learning have been expanded on through the discovery of a wide range of learning phenomena. Computational models have been developed based on the concept of minimizing reward prediction errors. The Rescorla-Wagner model, in particular, is a well-known model that has greatly influenced the field of reinforcement learning. However, the simplicity of these models restricts their ability to fully explain the diverse range of behavioral phenomena associated with learning. In this study, we adopt the free energy principle, which suggests that living systems strive to minimize surprise or uncertainty under their internal models of the world. We consider the learning process as the minimization of free energy and investigate its relationship with the Rescorla-Wagner model, focusing on the informational aspects of learning, different types of surprise, and prediction errors based on beliefs and values. Furthermore, we explore how well-known behavioral phenomena such as blocking, overshadowing, and latent inhibition can be modeled within the active inference framework. We accomplish this by using the informational and novelty aspects of attention, which share similar ideas proposed by seemingly contradictory models such as Mackintosh and Pearce-Hall models. Thus, we demonstrate that the free energy principle, as a theoretical framework derived from first principles, can integrate the ideas and models of associative learning proposed based on empirical experiments and serve as a framework for a better understanding of the computational processes behind associative learning in the brain.", "authors": [{"name": "Petr Anokhin", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Artyom Sorokin", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Mikhail Burtsev", "affiliation": "Royal Institution of Great Britain", "orcid": "0000-0003-1614-1695"}, {"name": "Karl Friston", "affiliation": "VERSES (United States)", "orcid": "0000-0001-7984-8909"}], "year": 2024, "doi": "10.1162/neco_a_01711", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W4402744240", "venue": "Neural Computation", "citation_count": 2, "references": ["openalex:W354832773", "openalex:W609092168", "openalex:W1546799349", "openalex:W1781576227", "openalex:W1986264597", "openalex:W2000514530", "openalex:W2001284551", "openalex:W2002907081", "openalex:W2008544186", "openalex:W2019515298", "openalex:W2034370736", "openalex:W2034806191", "openalex:W2039546655", "openalex:W2042233841", "openalex:W2057639861", "openalex:W2059320470", "openalex:W2085754318", "openalex:W2090144013", "openalex:W2094342172", "openalex:W2109203825", "openalex:W2111947800", "openalex:W2117257474", "openalex:W2119624849", "openalex:W2127531110", "openalex:W2132003317", "openalex:W2145339207", "openalex:W2148764920", "openalex:W2170283496", "openalex:W2312491913", "openalex:W2419438565", "openalex:W2463330366", "openalex:W2466376138", "openalex:W2743911451", "openalex:W2765383588", "openalex:W2892266804", "openalex:W2928639725", "openalex:W3001808890", "openalex:W3003886363", "openalex:W3041202696", "openalex:W3095485376", "openalex:W3108742966", "openalex:W3118752252", "openalex:W3118769118", "openalex:W3207389317", "openalex:W3210018673", "openalex:W3211802703", "openalex:W4226023986", "openalex:W4226400653", "openalex:W4229063633", "openalex:W4246602395", "openalex:W4281687715", "openalex:W6606625665", "openalex:W6632714132", "openalex:W6682025713", "openalex:W6713989974"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Active Inference and Reinforcement Learning: A Unified Inference on Continuous State and Action Spaces Under Partial Observability", "abstract": "Abstract Reinforcement learning (RL) has garnered significant attention for developing decision-making agents that aim to maximize rewards, specified by an external supervisor, within fully observable environments. However, many real-world problems involve partial or noisy observations, where agents cannot access complete and accurate information about the environment. These problems are commonly formulated as partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). Previous studies have tackled RL in POMDPs by either incorporating the memory of past actions and observations or by inferring the true state of the environment from observed data. Nevertheless, aggregating observations and actions over time becomes impractical in problems with large decision-making time horizons and high-dimensional spaces. Furthermore, inference-based RL approaches often require many environmental samples to perform well, as they focus solely on reward maximization and neglect uncertainty in the inferred state. Active inference (AIF) is a framework naturally formulated in POMDPs and directs agents to select actions by minimizing a function called expected free energy (EFE). This supplies reward-maximizing (or exploitative) behavior, as in RL, with information-seeking (or exploratory) behavior. Despite this exploratory behavior of AIF, its use is limited to problems with small time horizons and discrete spaces due to the computational challenges associated with EFE. In this article, we propose a unified principle that establishes a theoretical connection between AIF and RL, enabling seamless integration of these two approaches and overcoming their limitations in continuous space POMDP settings. We substantiate our findings with rigorous theoretical analysis, providing novel perspectives for using AIF in designing and implementing artificial agents. Experimental results demonstrate the superior learning capabilities of our method compared to other alternative RL approaches in solving partially observable tasks with continuous spaces. Notably, our approach harnesses information-seeking exploration, enabling it to effectively solve reward-free problems and rendering explicit task reward design by an external supervisor optional.", "authors": [{"name": "Parvin Malekzadeh", "affiliation": "University of Toronto", "orcid": null}, {"name": "Konstantinos N.

{"title": "Functional contextual implementation of an evolutionary, entropy-based, and embodied free energy framework: Utilizing Lagrangian mechanics and evolutionary game theory’s truth vs. fitness test of the veridicality of phenomenological experience", "abstract": "The Bayesian approach of cognitive science largely takes the position that evolution drives perception to produce precepts that are veridical. However, some efforts utilizing evolutionary game theory simulations have shown that perception is more likely based on a fitness function, which promotes survival rather than promoting perceptual truth about the environment. Although these findings do not correspond well with the standard Bayesian approach to cognition, they may correspond with a behavioral functional contextual approach that is ontologically neutral (a-ontological). This approach, formalized through a post-Skinnerian account of behaviorism called relational frame theory (RFT), can, in fact, be shown to correspond well with an evolutionary fitness function, whereby contextual functions form that corresponds to a fitness function interface of the world. This fitness interface approach therefore may help provide a mathematical description for a functional contextual interface of phenomenological experience. Furthermore, this more broadly fits with a neurological active inference approach based on the free-energy principle (FEP) and more broadly with Lagrangian mechanics. These assumptions of how fitness beats truth (FBT) and FEP correspond to RFT are then discussed within a broader multidimensional and evolutionary framework called the extended evolutionary meta-model (EEMM) that has emerged out of the functional contextual behavioral science literature to incorporate principles of cognition, neurobiology, behaviorism, and evolution and are discussed in the context of a novel RFT framework called “Neurobiological and Natural Selection Relational Frame Theory” (N-frame). This framework mathematically connects RFT to FBT, FEP, and EEMM within a single framework that expands into dynamic graph networking. This is then discussed for its implications of empirical work at the non-ergodic process-based idiographic level as applied to individual and societal level dynamic modeling and clinical work. This discussion is framed within the context of individuals that are described as evolutionary adaptive and conscious (observer-self) agents that minimize entropy and can promote a prosocial society through group-level values and psychological flexibility.", "authors": [{"name": "Darren J.

{"title": "‘Bodily precision’: a predictive coding account of individual differences in interoceptive accuracy", "abstract": "Individuals differ in their awareness of afferent information from within their bodies, which is typically assessed by a heartbeat perception measure of ‘interoceptive accuracy’ (IAcc). Neural and behavioural correlates of this trait have been investigated, but a theoretical explanation has yet to be presented. Building on recent models that describe interoception within the free energy/predictive coding framework, this paper applies similar principles to IAcc, proposing that individual differences in IAcc depend on ‘precision’ in interoceptive systems, i.e. the relative weight accorded to ‘prior’ representations and ‘prediction errors’ (that part of incoming interoceptive sensation not accounted for by priors), at various levels within the cortical hierarchy and between modalities. Attention has the effect of optimizing precision both within and between sensory modalities. Our central assumption is that people with high IAcc are able, with attention, to prioritize interoception over other sensory modalities and can thus adjust the relative precision of their interoceptive priors and prediction errors, where appropriate, given their personal history. This characterization explains key findings within the interoception literature; links results previously seen as unrelated or contradictory; and may have important implications for understanding cognitive, behavioural and psychopathological consequences of both high and low interoceptive awareness.

This study combined computational simulations and pharmaco-electroencephalography in humans, to test a formulation of perceptual inference based upon the free energy principle. This formulation suggests that ACh enhances the precision of bottom-up synaptic transmission in cortical hierarchies by optimizing the gain of supragranular pyramidal cells. Simulations of a mismatch negativity paradigm predicted a rapid trial-by-trial suppression of evoked sensory prediction error (PE) responses that is attenuated by cholinergic neuromodulation. We confirmed this prediction empirically with a placebo-controlled study of cholinesterase inhibition. Furthermore, using dynamic causal modeling, we found that drug-induced differences in PE responses could be explained by gain modulation in supragranular pyramidal cells in primary sensory cortex.

{"title": "Active inference and agency: optimal control without cost functions", "abstract": "This paper describes a variational free-energy formulation of (partially observable) Markov decision problems in decision making under uncertainty. We show that optimal control can be cast as active inference. In active inference, both action and posterior beliefs about hidden states minimise a free energy bound on the negative log-likelihood of observed states, under a generative model. In this setting, reward or cost functions are absorbed into prior beliefs about state transitions and terminal states. Effectively, this converts optimal control into a pure inference problem, enabling the application of standard Bayesian filtering techniques. We then consider optimal trajectories that rest on posterior beliefs about hidden states in the future. Crucially, this entails modelling control as a hidden state that endows the generative model with a representation of agency. This leads to a distinction between models with and without inference on hidden control states; namely, agency-free and agency-based models, respectively.", "authors": [{"name": "Karl Friston", "affiliation": "University College London", "orcid": "0000-0001-7984-8909"}, {"name": "Spyridon Samothrakis", "affiliation": "University of Essex", "orcid": "0000-0003-1902-9690"}, {"name": "Read Montague", "affiliation": "Carilion Clinic", "orcid": null}], "year": 2012, "doi": "10.1007/s00422-012-0512-8", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W2091405003", "venue": "Biological Cybernetics", "citation_count": 242, "references": ["openalex:W160989634", "openalex:W609092168", "openalex:W1495732641", "openalex:W1497039698", "openalex:W1557517019", "openalex:W1590986876", "openalex:W1607896360", "openalex:W1746680969", "openalex:W1814308503", "openalex:W1925816294", "openalex:W1971715144", "openalex:W1971758547", "openalex:W1973243121", "openalex:W1974246960", "openalex:W1977628053", "openalex:W1979732124", "openalex:W1991495714", "openalex:W1998651249", "openalex:W2005866069", "openalex:W2020783158", "openalex:W2026659355", "openalex:W2026799324", "openalex:W2028145673", "openalex:W2029321550", "openalex:W2037917209", "openalex:W2040598998", "openalex:W2043849093", "openalex:W2043962331", "openalex:W2045833919", "openalex:W2047229728", "openalex:W2056653303", "openalex:W2061097716", "openalex:W2070813962", "openalex:W2078443730", "openalex:W2078594241", "openalex:W2080039641", "openalex:W2089029564", "openalex:W2096016260", "openalex:W2096375888", "openalex:W2096962395", "openalex:W2101448098", "openalex:W2105714874", "openalex:W2107662876", "openalex:W2109925931", "openalex:W2111467524", "openalex:W2111947800", "openalex:W2114307208", "openalex:W2115979064", "openalex:W2119717200", "openalex:W2119885245", "openalex:W2123157758", "openalex:W2124526257", "openalex:W2130195834", "openalex:W2135100787", "openalex:W2136634080", "openalex:W2137411342", "openalex:W2137808289", "openalex:W2138623500", "openalex:W2140173765", "openalex:W2143072483", "openalex:W2145060720", "openalex:W2147008239", "openalex:W2148067905", "openalex:W2148764920", "openalex:W2149565728", "openalex:W2149960632", "openalex:W2152742892", "openalex:W2153960487", "openalex:W2155772159", "openalex:W2158282517", "openalex:W2159080219", "openalex:W2165730296", "openalex:W2168359464", "openalex:W2171084228", "openalex:W2172273932", "openalex:W2268119109", "openalex:W2317030384", "openalex:W2321292752", "openalex:W2325147017", "openalex:W2485373351", "openalex:W2567948266", "openalex:W4243509751", "openalex:W4251227784"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Reshaping computational neuropsychiatry beyond synaptopathy", "abstract": "Abstract Computational neuropsychiatry is a leading discipline in explaining psychopathology in terms of neuronal message passing, distributed processing and belief propagation in neuronal networks. Active Inference (AI) is a way of representing this dysfunctional signal processing. According to the AI approach, all neuronal processing and action selection can be explained by maximizing Bayesian model evidence or minimizing variational free energy. Following these principles, it has been suggested that dysconnection in neuronal networks results in aberrant belief updating and erroneous inference, leading to psychiatric and neurologic symptoms. However, there is a classic distinction between disorders of inference (or synaptopathy—including the majority of psychiatric disorders) and disorders of brain function (including vascular neurological pathologies and severe forms of tauopathy and synucleinopathies). This distinction is generally based on the idea that synaptopathies impair neuromodulatory precision weighting, leading to rigid inferences or heightened sensitivity to noise, while disorders of brain function are linked to damage in the nervous system (disconnection). This makes it challenging to apply the logic of the free energy principle. We suggest that this distinction will enable future models of neuropsychiatric symptoms to be improved by considering more than neuronal message passing.", "authors": [{"name": "Hugo Bottemanne", "affiliation": "Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique", "orcid": "0000-0003-2958-0849"}, {"name": "Stéphane Mouchabac", "affiliation": "Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique", "orcid": "0000-0002-4226-7956"}, {"name": "Christophe Gauld", "affiliation": "Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1", "orcid": "0000-0003-4510-6186"}], "year": 2025, "doi": "10.1093/brain/awaf031", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W4406906756", "venue": "Brain", "citation_count": 1, "references": ["openalex:W1515138319", "openalex:W2011459890", "openalex:W2014632617", "openalex:W2043849093", "openalex:W2046258436", "openalex:W2049114067", "openalex:W2059320470", "openalex:W2060449369", "openalex:W2070461647", "openalex:W2077648298", "openalex:W2094348922", "openalex:W2098328927", "openalex:W2114302768", "openalex:W2135713127", "openalex:W2147565549", "openalex:W2154653671", "openalex:W2169356885", "openalex:W2424475825", "openalex:W2479616914", "openalex:W2498492890", "openalex:W2547057105", "openalex:W2552810632", "openalex:W2603168527", "openalex:W2623066203", "openalex:W2781668895", "openalex:W2890724683", "openalex:W2901597764", "openalex:W3094945647", "openalex:W3164390524", "openalex:W3169104567", "openalex:W4225640137", "openalex:W4327554766", "openalex:W4387246721", "openalex:W4389330422", "openalex:W6640871937"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "A Neural Network Implementation for Free Energy Principle", "abstract": "The free energy principle (FEP), as an encompassing framework and a unified brain theory, has been widely applied to account for various problems in fields such as cognitive science, neuroscience, social interaction, and hermeneutics. As a computational model deeply rooted in math and statistics, FEP posits an optimization problem based on variational Bayes, which is solved either by dynamic programming or expectation maximization in practice. However, there seems to be a bottleneck in extending the FEP to machine learning and implementing such models with neural networks. This paper gives a preliminary attempt at bridging FEP and machine learning, via a classical neural network model, the Helmholtz machine. As a variational machine learning model, the Helmholtz machine is optimized by minimizing its free energy, the same objective as FEP. Although the Helmholtz machine is not temporal, it gives an ideal parallel to the vanilla FEP and the hierarchical model of the brain, under which the active inference and predictive coding could be formulated coherently. Besides a detailed theoretical discussion, the paper also presents a preliminary experiment to validate the hypothesis. By fine-tuning the trained neural network through active inference, the model performance is promoted to accuracy above 99\\%. In the meantime, the data distribution is continuously deformed to a salience that conforms to the model representation, as a result of active sampling.", "authors": [{"name": "Jingwei Liu", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0002-4685-0196"}], "year": 2023, "doi": "10.48550/arxiv.2306.06792", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W4380558455", "venue": "arXiv (Cornell University)", "citation_count": 1, "references": [], "publication_date": null}

{"title": "Representationalism and Enactivism in Cognitive Translation Studies: A Predictive Processing Perspective", "abstract": "Representational Theories of Mind have long dominated Cognitive Translation Studies, typically assuming that translation involves the manipulation of internal representations (symbols) that stand in for external states of affairs. In recent years, classical representationalism has given way to more nuanced, inferential, interpretive, context-sensitive, and modern representational models, some of which align naturally with probabilistic and predictive approaches. While these frameworks remain broadly compatible with one another, radical enactivism offers a more disruptive alternative: it denies representational content altogether, viewing translation instead as an affectively grounded, context-sensitive, self-evidencing activity shaped by the translator’s embodied engagement with text, context, and sociocultural norms. From an enactivist standpoint, translation emerges not from static symbolic mappings, but from situated, embodied, and affectively modulated inference processes that dynamically negotiate meaning across languages.

{"title": "Meta-Intrinsic Dynamics and Semantic Capacity", "abstract": "This preprint develops a thermodynamically grounded, information-theoretic framework for emergent intelligence in open, self-modifying systems. Instead of assuming a fixed state space and model class, the paper introduces an open representation space of prefix-free codes for internal states, parameters, and architectures. Structural novelty and new “dimensions” of representation appear as internally generated growth in description complexity. On top of a classical stochastic thermodynamics description with moving boundaries, the work defines three meta-intrinsic degrees that quantify how much of the relevant dynamics is internally driven: a dynamic degree (information flows in state/parameter/architecture updates), a dimensional degree (internally driven complexity growth), and a boundary degree (autonomous boundary reconfiguration). These are shown to be robust under broad equivalence classes of codes and alphabets, under explicit asymptotic scaling assumptions. To capture semantics, the paper defines a thermodynamic viability vector that bundles future environment, boundary configuration, nonequilibrium free energy, and internal/boundary entropy-production rates. Intrinsic semantic capacity is then defined as a mutual-information advantage of a semantic code over a task-agnostic base code with respect to this viability vector. Under information-thermodynamic inequalities and Landauer-type structural cost assumptions, the paper proves law-like resource inequalities that bound the long-time growth rate of intrinsic semantic capacity in terms of entropy-production budgets and non-isothermal information-processing cost factors. The framework is contrasted with the free energy principle / active inference, predictive-information approaches, and integrated information theory. Rather than reducing intelligence to probabilistic inference in a fixed model, it treats emergent intelligence as the thermodynamically constrained organisation of information flows, structural growth, and boundary dynamics that support predictive, autopoietic semantics in open-ended systems.", "authors": [{"name": "Takahashi, K", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0009-0004-4273-3365"}], "year": 2025, "doi": "10.5281/zenodo.17880033", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W7114795173", "venue": "Zenodo (CERN European Organization for Nuclear Research)", "citation_count": 2, "references": [], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Navigating Complexity: How Resource-Limited Agents Derive Probability and Generate Emergence", "abstract": "In the Kolmogorov Theory of consciousness (KT), an algorithmic agent is an information-processing system that compresses sensory data into simpler representations to plan actions that optimize its objective function. Algorithmic agents operate under limited data access, finite computational resources, and fundamental limits from the algorithmic information theory (AIT). In this paper, we demonstrate how these limitations naturally give rise to the principles of probability, Bayesian inference, and the concept of emergence within this framework.Using a toy example of an agent compressing data from a large library, we demonstrate how limitations in data access naturally lead to a multi-model strategy, where probabilistic reasoning and Occam's razor emerge as the agent navigates between different models. This process is naturally extended by allowing it to accommodate objective functions beyond compression. Next, we propose a formal definition of emergence from the notions of coarse-graining and Kolmogorov complexity. Due to its limited resources, the agent must employ coarse-graining to transform data that initially appears incompressible into a compressible, aggregate form while retaining a non-trivial structure. The agent must find patterns and operate at some coarse-graining level to ensure survival. Coarse-graining may include various forms of data reorganization, such as spatiotemporal averaging, compressive sensing, and dimensionality reduction techniques.We discuss the connections to other theoretical approaches, such as Jaynes' robot, the Free Energy Principle, and Active Inference. By addressing how an ideal agent copes with the inherent limitations of data access and computational capacity, we provide a unified framework for understanding both probabilistic reasoning and emergence in algorithmic agents.", "authors": [{"name": "Giulio Ruffini", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0003-3084-0177"}], "year": 2024, "doi": "10.31234/osf.io/3xy5d", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W4402606099", "venue": null, "citation_count": 3, "references": [], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "A Computational Model of Minimal Phenomenal Experience (MPE)", "abstract": "Minimal phenomenal experience (MPE), or \"pure consciousness,\" represents a fundamental form of conscious experience characterised by reflexive meta-awareness and the absence of many features of regular phenomenology. It has been described as e.g. non-conceptual, atemporal, non-egoic and aperspectival. This paper aims to develop a computational model of MPE using the mathematics of variational free energy minimization derived from the free energy principle (FEP). I employ a computational neurophenomenology approach, formalising key phenomenological features of MPE within the active inference framework. The model incorporates parametric depth, allowing for higher-order inferences about generative model parameters. I relate specific model parameterisations to reported MPE qualities such as meta-awareness, equanimity, effortlessness, and non-conceptuality. The proposed model suggests that MPE arises when an agent achieves very low free energy through self-directed awareness and modulation of their generative model, particularly by emphasising awareness of awareness itself. The model predicts elements of MPE phenomenology including a sense of effortlessness, timelessness, and the potential for a \"zero-person perspective&amp;rdquo;. The implementation details for a simulation of the proposed model are outlined, as well as directions for empirical validation.", "authors": [{"name": "Lars Sandved-Smith", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0002-2282-1438"}], "year": 2024, "doi": "10.20944/preprints202411.0649.v1", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W4404339871", "venue": "Preprints.org", "citation_count": 1, "references": [], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Realising Synthetic Active Inference Agents, Part I: Epistemic Objectives and Graphical Specification Language", "abstract": "The Free Energy Principle (FEP) is a theoretical framework for describing how (intelligent) systems self-organise into coherent, stable structures by minimising a free energy functional. Active Inference (AIF) is a corollary of the FEP that specifically details how systems that are able to plan for the future (agents) function by minimising particular free energy functionals that incorporate information seeking components. This paper is the first in a series of two where we derive a synthetic version of AIF on free form factor graphs. The present paper focuses on deriving a local version of the free energy functionals used for AIF. This enables us to construct a version of AIF which applies to arbitrary graphical models and interfaces with prior work on message passing algorithms. The resulting messages are derived in our companion paper. We also identify a gap in the graphical notation used for factor graphs. While factor graphs are great at expressing a generative model, they have so far been unable to specify the full optimisation problem including constraints. To solve this problem we develop Constrained Forney-style Factor Graph (CFFG) notation which permits a fully graphical description of variational inference objectives. We then proceed to show how CFFG's can be used to reconstruct prior algorithms for AIF as well as derive new ones. The latter is demonstrated by deriving an algorithm that permits direct policy inference for AIF agents, circumventing a long standing scaling issue that has so far hindered the application of AIF in industrial settings. We demonstrate our algorithm on the classic T-maze task and show that it reproduces the information seeking behaviour that is a hallmark feature of AIF.", "authors": [{"name": "Magnus Koudahl", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0003-3411-5036"}, {"name": "Thijs van de Laar", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0003-3936-5368"}, {"name": "Bert B.A. de Vries", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0002-0000-2917"}], "year": 2023, "doi": "10.48550/arxiv.2306.08014", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W4380989335", "venue": "arXiv (Cornell University)", "citation_count": 1, "references": [], "publication_date": null}

By de novo learning, we mean discovering, directly from observations, the structure and parameters of a discrete generative model for sequential policy optimisation. Concretely, our procedure grows and then reduces a model until it discovers a pullback attractor over (generalised) states; this attracting set supplies paths of least action among goal states while avoiding costly states. The implicit efficiency rests upon reframing the learning problem through the lens of the free energy principle, under which it is sufficient to learn a generative model whose dynamics feature such an attracting set.

{"title": "Uncertainty, epistemics and active inference", "abstract": "Abstract Biological systems—like ourselves—are constantly faced with uncertainty. Despite noisy sensory data, and volatile environments, creatures appear to actively maintain their integrity. To account for this remarkable ability to make optimal decisions in the face of a capricious world, we propose a generative model that represents the beliefs an agent might possess about their own uncertainty. By simulating a noisy and volatile environment, we demonstrate how uncertainty influences optimal epistemic (visual) foraging. In our simulations, saccades were deployed less frequently to regions with a lower sensory precision, while a greater volatility led to a shorter inhibition of return. These simulations illustrate a principled explanation for some cardinal aspects of visual foraging—and allow us to propose a correspondence between the representation of uncertainty and ascending neuromodulatory systems, complementing that suggested by Yu &amp; Dayan (Yu &amp; Dayan 2005 Neuron46, 681–692.

{"title": "Active Inference for Self-Organizing Multi-LLM Systems: A Bayesian Thermodynamic Approach to Adaptation", "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel approach to creating adaptive language agents by integrating active inference with large language models (LLMs). While LLMs demonstrate remarkable capabilities, their reliance on static prompts limits adaptation to new information and changing environments. We address this by implementing an active inference framework that acts as a cognitive layer above an LLM-based agent, dynamically adjusting prompts and search strategies through principled information-seeking behavior. Our framework models the environment using three state factors (prompt, search, and information states) with seven observation modalities capturing quality metrics. By framing the agent's learning through the free energy principle, we enable systematic exploration of prompt combinations and search strategies. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, with the agent developing accurate models of environment dynamics evidenced by emergent structure in observation matrices. Action selection patterns reveal sophisticated exploration-exploitation behavior, transitioning from initial information-gathering to targeted prompt testing. The integration of thermodynamic principles with language model capabilities provides a principled framework for creating robust, adaptable agents, extending active inference beyond traditional low-dimensional control problems to high-dimensional, language-driven environments.", "authors": [{"name": "Rithvik Prakki", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2024, "doi": "10.48550/arxiv.2412.10425", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W4405468121", "venue": "arXiv (Cornell University)", "citation_count": 1, "references": [], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Decision-making balance in suicide: an active inference account", "abstract": "<b>Introduction:</b> Suicide is a behaviour whose motivation is challenging to explain as it can neither be rewarded nor punished since the agent no longer exists. The conventional explanation is that suicide is motivated as an escape from unresolvable psychological pain. However, despite suicide's high availability, its rates are very low (about 0.014% in the US). This speaks to high ambivalence as an essential feature of the suicidal mind.<b>Method:</b> To explicate the ambivalence of the suicidal mind, suicide has recently been framed within the active inference framework (AIF). AIF appears to be appropriate for conceptualising suicide because it is a theory of choice behaviour under uncertainty that, in suicide, cannot be resolved or, validated by experience.

{"title": "Exploring Disturbance as a Force for Good in Motor Learning", "abstract": "Abstract Disturbance forces facilitate motor learning, but theoretical explanations for this counterintuitive phenomenon are lacking. Smooth arm movements require predictions (inference) about the force-field associated with a workspace. The Free Energy Principle (FEP) suggests that such ‘active inference’ is driven by ‘surprise’. We used these insights to create a formal model that explains why disturbance helps learning. In two experiments, participants undertook a continuous tracking task where they learned how to move their arm in different directions through a novel 3D force field. We compared baseline performance before and after exposure to the novel field to quantify learning. In Experiment 1, the exposure phases (but not the baseline measures) were delivered under three different conditions: (i) robot haptic assistance; (ii) no guidance; (iii) robot haptic disturbance. The disturbance group showed the best learning as our model predicted. Experiment 2 further tested our FEP inspired model. Assistive and/or disturbance forces were applied as a function of performance (low surprise), and compared to a random error manipulation (high surprise). The random group showed the most improvement as predicted by the model. Thus, motor learning can be conceptualised as a process of entropy reduction. Short term motor strategies (e.g. global impedance) can mitigate unexpected perturbations, but continuous movements require active inference about external force-fields in order to create accurate internal models of the external world (motor learning). Our findings reconcile research on the relationship between noise, variability, and motor learning, and show that information is the currency of motor learning.", "authors": [{"name": "Jack Brookes", "affiliation": "University of Leeds", "orcid": "0000-0002-4600-7561"}, {"name": "Faisal Mushtaq", "affiliation": "University of Leeds", "orcid": "0000-0001-7881-1127"}, {"name": "Earle Jamieson", "affiliation": "University of Leeds", "orcid": null}, {"name": "Aaron J.

{"title": "Free Energy Projective Simulation (FEPS): Active inference with interpretability", "abstract": "In the last decade, the free energy principle (FEP) and active inference (AIF) have achieved many successes connecting conceptual models of learning and cognition to mathematical models of perception and action. This effort is driven by a multidisciplinary interest in understanding aspects of self-organizing complex adaptive systems, including elements of agency. Various reinforcement learning (RL) models performing active inference have been proposed and trained on standard RL tasks using deep neural networks. Recent work has focused on improving such agents’ performance in complex environments by incorporating the latest machine learning techniques. In this paper, we build upon these techniques. Within the constraints imposed by the FEP and AIF, we attempt to model agents in an interpretable way without deep neural networks by introducing Free Energy Projective Simulation (FEPS). Using internal rewards only, FEPS agents build a representation of their partially observable environments with which they interact. Following AIF, the policy to achieve a given task is derived from this world model by minimizing the expected free energy. Leveraging the interpretability of the model, techniques are introduced to deal with long-term goals and reduce prediction errors caused by erroneous hidden state estimation. We test the FEPS model on two RL environments inspired from behavioral biology: a timed response task and a navigation task in a partially observable grid. Our results show that FEPS agents fully resolve the ambiguity of both environments by appropriately contextualizing their observations based on prediction accuracy only. In addition, they infer optimal policies flexibly for any target observation in the environment.", "authors": [{"name": "Joséphine Pazem", "affiliation": "Universität Innsbruck", "orcid": "0000-0002-9609-3146"}, {"name": "Marius Krumm", "affiliation": "Universität Innsbruck", "orcid": null}, {"name": "Alexander Q.

{"title": "Neural Elements for Predictive Coding", "abstract": "Predictive coding theories of sensory brain function interpret the hierarchical construction of the cerebral cortex as a Bayesian, generative model capable of predicting the sensory data consistent with any given percept. Predictions are fed backward in the hierarchy and reciprocated by prediction error in the forward direction, acting to modify the representation of the outside world at increasing levels of abstraction, and so to optimize the nature of perception over a series of iterations. This accounts for many ‘illusory’ instances of perception where what is seen (heard, etc.) is unduly influenced by what is expected, based on past experience. This simple conception, the hierarchical exchange of prediction and prediction error, confronts a rich cortical microcircuitry that is yet to be fully documented. This article presents the view that, in the current state of theory and practice, it is profitable to begin a two-way exchange: that predictive coding theory can support an understanding of cortical microcircuit function, and prompt particular aspects of future investigation, whilst existing knowledge of microcircuitry can, in return, influence theoretical development. As an example, a neural inference arising from the earliest formulations of predictive coding is that the source populations of forward and backward pathways should be completely separate, given their functional distinction; this aspect of circuitry – that neurons with extrinsically bifurcating axons do not project in both directions – has only recently been confirmed. Here, the computational architecture prescribed by a generalized (free-energy) formulation of predictive coding is combined with the classic ‘canonical microcircuit’ and the laminar architecture of hierarchical extrinsic connectivity to produce a template schematic, that is further examined in the light of (a) updates in the microcircuitry of primate visual cortex, and (b) rapid technical advances made possible by transgenic neural engineering in the mouse. The exercise highlights a number of recurring themes, amongst them the consideration of interneuron diversity as a spur to theoretical development and the potential for specifying a pyramidal neuron’s function by its individual ‘connectome,’ combining its extrinsic projection (forward, backward or subcortical) with evaluation of its intrinsic network (e.g., unidirectional versus bidirectional connections with other pyramidal neurons).", "authors": [{"name": "Stewart Shipp", "affiliation": "Chinese Academy of Sciences", "orcid": "0000-0002-6703-2352"}], "year": 2016, "doi":

{"title": "Active Inference &amp; Behavior Engineering for Teams", "abstract": "Comprehensive frameworks for Teams should include various functionalities and structures in order to capture the broad range of affordances available for modern Remote Teams, including, but not limited to, synchronous &amp; asynchronous communications, memes, geospatial maps, hardware/software use, and contact escalation. We suggest that Systems Engineering provides guidelines to define the functions of Ontologies, Narratives, Formal documents, and Tools (ONFT) within the context of the life cycle of any System of Interest. Following this ONFT assessment it is possible to break out to sub-systems levels and mechanistic analysis. In this paper we explore how a new generation of ONFT for Remote Teams could be based on Active Inference, a process theory related to the Free Energy Principle. Effective ONFT based upon Active Inference could lead to the realization of lightweight and powerful epistemic tools to guide everyday decision-making in an embodied, enactive fashion. Such a technology for Remote Teams would lead to fundamental changes in various aspects of Team function, for example the efficiency of a Team’s production of artifacts or self-reported “phenomenology of the working day”.", "authors": [{"name": "Alexander Vyatkin", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0003-1306-4620"}, {"name": "Ivan Metelkin", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Alexandra Mikhailova", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "RJ Cordes", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Daniel Friedman", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0001-6232-9096"}], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.5281/zenodo.4021163", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W3211319881", "venue": "Zenodo (CERN European Organization for Nuclear Research)", "citation_count": 1, "references": [], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Glacial-Isostatic Adjustment-II. The Inverse Problem", "abstract": "The principle of correspondence is invoked to determine Laplace transform domain solutions to the surface mass loading problem for radially stratified visco-elastic (Maxwell) spheroids. These Laplace transform domain solutions are expressed in terms of visco-elastic analogues of the conventional surface load Love numbers of elasticity. These visco-elastic Love numbers may be approximately transformed to the time domain using an extremal technique. Application of this technique shows that the Love number time histories may be well approximated by the linear superposition of a discrete set of purely exponential relaxations plus a constant term. Alternatively the discrete spectrum of relaxation times involved in the synthesis of each Love number time history may be found exactly by solving the associated homogeneous problem. Such solutions determine the set of eigen-decay times associated with the normal modes of viscous gravitational relaxation of the visco-elastic planetary model. The solution of the inhomogeneous problem may be expressed in the form of a normal mode expansion. This normal mode expansion is employed as the basis for the construction of a rigorous first-order perturbation theory for the inference of the viscosity of the deep interior of the planet. A variational principle is derived which determines to first order that shift in position of a free decay pole in the relaxation spectrum which is forced by the addition of a radially-distributed perturbation of viscosity to the starting model. This determines the differential kernels required for the solution of the inverse problem. The uniqueness of the state of isostatic equilibrium for the viscously incompressible Maxwell models employed in this analysis is demonstrated and this uniqueness allows us to calculate the shift in the residue which is associated with the shift in position of a free decay pole for the inhomogeneous problem. The inhomogeneous problem is thus closed to first order. A formula is derived for the differential kernels appropriate to the inhomogeneous problem. The time domain form of these kernels may be calculated analytically. The structure of the full inverse theory is sufficiently simple that it may be employed to rigorously test the compatibility of the simple Maxwell model with the observed relaxation of the Earth's shape which accompanied deglaciation at the end of the last ice age.", "authors": [{"name": "W.

{"title": "Generalised free energy and active inference", "abstract": "Active inference is an approach to understanding behaviour that rests upon the idea that the brain uses an internal generative model to predict incoming sensory data. The fit between this model and data may be improved in two ways. The brain could optimise probabilistic beliefs about the variables in the generative model (i.e. perceptual inference). Alternatively, by acting on the world, it could change the sensory data, such that they are more consistent with the model. This implies a common objective function (variational free energy) for action and perception that scores the fit between an internal model and the world. We compare two free energy functionals for active inference in the framework of Markov decision processes. One of these is a functional of beliefs (i.e. probability distributions) about states and policies, but a function of observations, while the second is a functional of beliefs about all three. In the former (expected free energy), prior beliefs about outcomes are not part of the generative model (because they are absorbed into the prior over policies). Conversely, in the second (generalised free energy), priors over outcomes become an explicit component of the generative model. When using the free energy function, which is blind to future observations, we equip the generative model with a prior over policies that ensure preferred (i.e. priors over) outcomes are realised. In other words, if we expect to encounter a particular kind of outcome, this lends plausibility to those policies for which this outcome is a consequence. In addition, this formulation ensures that selected policies minimise uncertainty about future outcomes by minimising the free energy expected in the future. When using the free energy functional—that effectively treats future observations as hidden states—we show that policies are inferred or selected that realise prior preferences by minimising the free energy of future expectations.

{"title": "Deeply Felt Affect: The Emergence of Valence in Deep Active Inference", "abstract": "Abstract The positive-negative axis of emotional valence has long been recognized as fundamental to adaptive behavior, but its origin and underlying function have largely eluded formal theorizing and computational modeling. Using deep active inference, a hierarchical inference scheme that rests on inverting a model of how sensory data are generated, we develop a principled Bayesian model of emotional valence. This formulation asserts that agents infer their valence state based on the expected precision of their action model—an internal estimate of overall model fitness (“subjective fitness”). This index of subjective fitness can be estimated within any environment and exploits the domain generality of second-order beliefs (beliefs about beliefs). We show how maintaining internal valence representations allows the ensuing affective agent to optimize confidence in action selection preemptively. Valence representations can in turn be optimized by leveraging the (Bayes-optimal) updating term for subjective fitness, which we label affective charge (AC). AC tracks changes in fitness estimates and lends a sign to otherwise unsigned divergences between predictions and outcomes. We simulate the resulting affective inference by subjecting an in silico affective agent to a T-maze paradigm requiring context learning, followed by context reversal. This formulation of affective inference offers a principled account of the link between affect, (mental) action, and implicit metacognition. It characterizes how a deep biological system can infer its affective state and reduce uncertainty about such inferences through internal action (i.e., top-down modulation of priors that underwrite confidence). Thus, we demonstrate the potential of active inference to provide a formal and computationally tractable account of affect. Our demonstration of the face validity and potential utility of this formulation represents the first step within a larger research program.

{"title": "Empirical Translation Process Research: Past and Possible Future Perspectives", "abstract": "Over the past four decades, efforts have been made to develop and evaluate models for Empirical Translation Process Research (TPR), yet a comprehensive framework remains elusive. This article traces the evolution of empirical TPR within the CRITT TPR-DB tradition and proposes the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference (AIF) as a framework for modeling deeply embedded translation processes. It introduces novel approaches for quantifying fundamental concepts of Relevance Theory (relevance, s-mode, i-mode), and establishes their relation to the Monitor Model, framing relevance maximization as a special case of minimizing free energy. FEP/AIF provides a mathematically rigorous foundation that enables modeling of deep temporal architectures in which embedded translation processes unfold on different timelines. This framework opens up exciting prospects for future research in predictive TPR, likely to enrich our comprehension of human translation processes, and making valuable contributions to the wider realm of translation studies and the design of cognitive architectures.", "authors": [{"name": "Michaël Carl", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0002-2815-0292"}], "year": 2023, "doi": "10.48550/arxiv.2308.01368", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W4385964792", "venue": "arXiv (Cornell University)", "citation_count": 1, "references": [], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Sentience and the Origins of Consciousness: From Cartesian Duality to Markovian Monism", "abstract": "This essay addresses Cartesian duality and how its implicit dialectic might be repaired using physics and information theory. Our agenda is to describe a key distinction in the physical sciences that may provide a foundation for the distinction between mind and matter, and between sentient and intentional systems. From this perspective, it becomes tenable to talk about the physics of sentience and ‘forces’ that underwrite our beliefs (in the sense of probability distributions represented by our internal states), which may ground our mental states and consciousness. We will refer to this view as Markovian monism, which entails two claims: (1) fundamentally, there is only one type of thing and only one type of irreducible property (hence monism). (2) All systems possessing a Markov blanket have properties that are relevant for understanding the mind and consciousness: if such systems have mental properties, then they have them partly by virtue of possessing a Markov blanket (hence Markovian). Markovian monism rests upon the information geometry of random dynamic systems. In brief, the information geometry induced in any system—whose internal states can be distinguished from external states—must acquire a dual aspect. This dual aspect concerns the (intrinsic) information geometry of the probabilistic evolution of internal states and a separate (extrinsic) information geometry of probabilistic beliefs about external states that are parameterised by internal states. We call these intrinsic (i.e., mechanical, or state-based) and extrinsic (i.e., Markovian, or belief-based) information geometries, respectively. Although these mathematical notions may sound complicated, they are fairly straightforward to handle, and may offer a means through which to frame the origins of consciousness.", "authors": [{"name": "Karl Friston", "affiliation": "University College London", "orcid": "0000-0001-7984-8909"}, {"name": "Wanja Wiese", "affiliation": "Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz", "orcid": "0000-0003-3338-7398"}, {"name": "J.

{"title": "Information and Efficiency in the Nervous System—A Synthesis", "abstract": "In systems biology, questions concerning the molecular and cellular makeup of an organism are of utmost importance, especially when trying to understand how unreliable components--like genetic circuits, biochemical cascades, and ion channels, among others--enable reliable and adaptive behaviour. The repertoire and speed of biological computations are limited by thermodynamic or metabolic constraints: an example can be found in neurons, where fluctuations in biophysical states limit the information they can encode--with almost 20-60% of the total energy allocated for the brain used for signalling purposes, either via action potentials or by synaptic transmission. Here, we consider the imperatives for neurons to optimise computational and metabolic efficiency, wherein benefits and costs trade-off against each other in the context of self-organised and adaptive behaviour. In particular, we try to link information theoretic (variational) and thermodynamic (Helmholtz) free-energy formulations of neuronal processing and show how they are related in a fundamental way through a complexity minimisation lemma.", "authors": [{"name": "Biswa Sengupta", "affiliation": "University College London", "orcid": "0000-0002-1377-6583"}, {"name": "Martin Stemmler", "affiliation": "Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience Munich", "orcid": "0000-0002-9040-0475"}, {"name": "Karl Friston", "affiliation": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging", "orcid": "0000-0001-7984-8909"}], "year": 2013, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003157", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W2073820635", "venue": "PLoS Computational Biology", "citation_count": 205, "references": ["openalex:W43284170", "openalex:W92654806", "openalex:W1480115832", "openalex:W1486520839", "openalex:W1504499192", "openalex:W1509562192", "openalex:W1528822345", "openalex:W1549431774", "openalex:W1556815708", "openalex:W1562792231", "openalex:W1572568267", "openalex:W1667165204", "openalex:W1673584506", "openalex:W1776857128", "openalex:W1956327946", "openalex:W1971715144", "openalex:W1973747802", "openalex:W1974705591", "openalex:W1975700187", "openalex:W1977628053", "openalex:W1979191599", "openalex:W1983446016", "openalex:W1983485726", "openalex:W1986098213", "openalex:W1991362484", "openalex:W1992430091", "openalex:W1993197592", "openalex:W1993673892", "openalex:W1994624135", "openalex:W1995875735", "openalex:W1996075175", "openalex:W1997844067", "openalex:W1998071216", "openalex:W1998651249", "openalex:W1999488699", "openalex:W1999653836", "openalex:W2006967535", "openalex:W2015113576", "openalex:W2022995207", "openalex:W2027607804", "openalex:W2029657491", "openalex:W2032558547", "openalex:W2033001588", "openalex:W2037156065", "openalex:W2039656669", "openalex:W2040073285", "openalex:W2040486796", "openalex:W2040882507", "openalex:W2042422091", "openalex:W2049064952", "openalex:W2049450494", "openalex:W2052023461", "openalex:W2059825138", "openalex:W2068662533", "openalex:W2068967633", "openalex:W2072627350", "openalex:W2075187489", "openalex:W2094344877", "openalex:W2095087224", "openalex:W2098580305", "openalex:W2101692583", "openalex:W2102993821", "openalex:W2108384452", "openalex:W2112129677", "openalex:W2113257799", "openalex:W2114771311", "openalex:W2115979064", "openalex:W2119885245", "openalex:W2122741244", "openalex:W2124018923", "openalex:W2125010820", "openalex:W2128084896", "openalex:W2130453501", "openalex:W2131475304", "openalex:W2142176084", "openalex:W2144321909", "openalex:W2144588131", "openalex:W2144662207", "openalex:W2147008239", "openalex:W2148764920", "openalex:W2149801992", "openalex:W2150409050", "openalex:W2151271926", "openalex:W2151387592", "openalex:W2152435897", "openalex:W2152742892", "openalex:W2154562678", "openalex:W2156675727", "openalex:W2157376352", "openalex:W2157629899", "openalex:W2158947594", "openalex:W2159343681", "openalex:W2163886718", "openalex:W2164189343", "openalex:W2165055912", "openalex:W2168998384", "openalex:W2172463260", "openalex:W2275719488", "openalex:W2317030384", "openalex:W3004320394", "openalex:W3099348545", "openalex:W3165208394", "openalex:W4206315045", "openalex:W4232132600", "openalex:W4233798822", "openalex:W4246305369", "openalex:W4285719527", "openalex:W4299551239", "openalex:W6683308982"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "The Anatomy of Inference: Generative Models and Brain Structure", "abstract": "To infer the causes of its sensations, the brain must call on a generative (predictive) model. This necessitates passing local messages between populations of neurons to update beliefs about hidden variables in the world beyond its sensory samples. It also entails inferences about how we will act. Active inference is a principled framework that frames perception and action as approximate Bayesian inference. This has been successful in accounting for a wide range of physiological and behavioral phenomena. Recently, a process theory has emerged that attempts to relate inferences to their neurobiological substrates. In this paper, we review and develop the anatomical aspects of this process theory. We argue that the form of the generative models required for inference constrains the way in which brain regions connect to one another. Specifically, neuronal populations representing beliefs about a variable must receive input from populations representing the Markov blanket of that variable. We illustrate this idea in four different domains: perception, planning, attention, and movement. In doing so, we attempt to show how appealing to generative models enables us to account for anatomical brain architectures. Ultimately, committing to an anatomical theory of inference ensures we can form empirical hypotheses that can be tested using neuroimaging, neuropsychological, and electrophysiological experiments.",

{"title": "The Dopaminergic Midbrain Encodes the Expected Certainty about Desired Outcomes", "abstract": "Dopamine plays a key role in learning; however, its exact function in decision making and choice remains unclear. Recently, we proposed a generic model based on active (Bayesian) inference wherein dopamine encodes the precision of beliefs about optimal policies. Put simply, dopamine discharges reflect the confidence that a chosen policy will lead to desired outcomes. We designed a novel task to test this hypothesis, where subjects played a \"limited offer\" game in a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment. Subjects had to decide how long to wait for a high offer before accepting a low offer, with the risk of losing everything if they waited too long. Bayesian model comparison showed that behavior strongly supported active inference, based on surprise minimization, over classical utility maximization schemes. Furthermore, midbrain activity, encompassing dopamine projection neurons, was accurately predicted by trial-by-trial variations in model-based estimates of precision. Our findings demonstrate that human subjects infer both optimal policies and the precision of those inferences, and thus support the notion that humans perform hierarchical probabilistic Bayesian inference. In other words, subjects have to infer both what they should do as well as how confident they are in their choices, where confidence may be encoded by dopaminergic firing.", "authors": [{"name": "Philipp Schwartenbeck", "affiliation": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging", "orcid": "0000-0001-8943-9965"}, {"name": "Thomas H.

{"title": "Perception and self-organized instability", "abstract": "This paper considers state-dependent dynamics that mediate perception in the brain. In particular, it considers the formal basis of self-organized instabilities that enable perceptual transitions during Bayes-optimal perception. The basic phenomena we consider are perceptual transitions that lead to conscious ignition (Dehaene and Changeux, 2011) and how they depend on dynamical instabilities that underlie chaotic itinerancy (Breakspear, 2001; Tsuda, 2001) and self-organized criticality (Beggs and Plenz, 2003; Plenz and Thiagarajan, 2007; Shew et al., 2011). Our approach is based on a dynamical formulation of perception as approximate Bayesian inference, in terms of variational free energy minimization. This formulation suggests that perception has an inherent tendency to induce dynamical instabilities (critical slowing) that enable the brain to respond sensitively to sensory perturbations. We briefly review the dynamics of perception, in terms of generalized Bayesian filtering and free energy minimization, present a formal conjecture about self-organized instability and then test this conjecture, using neuronal (numerical) simulations of perceptual categorization.", "authors": [{"name": "Karl Friston", "affiliation": "University College London", "orcid": "0000-0001-7984-8909"}, {"name": "Michael Breakspear", "affiliation": "QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute", "orcid": "0000-0003-4943-3969"}, {"name": "Gustavo Deco", "affiliation": "Pompeu Fabra University", "orcid": "0000-0002-8995-7583"}], "year": 2012, "doi": "10.3389/fncom.2012.00044", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W2148242024", "venue": "Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience", "citation_count": 194, "references": ["openalex:W2392040", "openalex:W380338613", "openalex:W1481764136", "openalex:W1515138319", "openalex:W1863658077", "openalex:W1971123690", "openalex:W1971715144", "openalex:W1973243121", "openalex:W1977628053", "openalex:W1978282545", "openalex:W1979732124", "openalex:W1981025738", "openalex:W1981443979", "openalex:W1985706433", "openalex:W1991362484", "openalex:W1993887342", "openalex:W1994892978", "openalex:W2003900693", "openalex:W2004978206", "openalex:W2015303758", "openalex:W2022238029", "openalex:W2026799324", "openalex:W2031066728", "openalex:W2031396362", "openalex:W2032558547", "openalex:W2035461931", "openalex:W2036964507", "openalex:W2045347463", "openalex:W2048648663", "openalex:W2059156134", "openalex:W2063922957", "openalex:W2070813962", "openalex:W2073955207", "openalex:W2075514521", "openalex:W2076618566", "openalex:W2079714205", "openalex:W2083070231", "openalex:W2090408525", "openalex:W2090857396", "openalex:W2096375888", "openalex:W2096962395", "openalex:W2104848063", "openalex:W2108010165", "openalex:W2111947800", "openalex:W2113748017", "openalex:W2115979064", "openalex:W2119333483", "openalex:W2119885245", "openalex:W2122803078", "openalex:W2127531110", "openalex:W2127958135", "openalex:W2128065872", "openalex:W2130195834", "openalex:W2133947501", "openalex:W2137411342", "openalex:W2137571295", "openalex:W2147336195", "openalex:W2148764920", "openalex:W2152742892", "openalex:W2157376352", "openalex:W2158065370", "openalex:W2317030384", "openalex:W2403125938", "openalex:W2490610550", "openalex:W3022780580", "openalex:W4229915299", "openalex:W4237117028", "openalex:W4240478533", "openalex:W4240971513", "openalex:W4249210107", "openalex:W4379517753", "openalex:W4392145873", "openalex:W6600096493", "openalex:W6630141279", "openalex:W6643036594", "openalex:W6643276836", "openalex:W6643519119", "openalex:W6645517253", "openalex:W6646775512", "openalex:W6656102646", "openalex:W6657225017", "openalex:W6658723161", "openalex:W6674678433", "openalex:W6675149333", "openalex:W6675587378", "openalex:W6676695175", "openalex:W6678246631", "openalex:W6678575826", "openalex:W6679123138", "openalex:W6679431192", "openalex:W6682377272", "openalex:W6699397322", "openalex:W6830473208", "openalex:W6831468618"], "publication_date": null}

We use simulations of a maze problem to illustrate how agents can solve quite complicated problems using context sensitive prior preferences to form subgoals. Our focus is on how epistemic behaviour-driven by novelty and the imperative to reduce uncertainty about the world-contextualises pragmatic or goal-directed behaviour. Using simulations, we illustrate the underlying process theory with synthetic behavioural and electrophysiological responses during exploration of a maze and subsequent navigation to a target location.

{"title": "Quantum Behavior as a Consequence of Ze Systems", "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel theoretical framework that reinterprets quantum behavior—superposition, interference, and wavefunction collapse—not as fundamental properties of matter but as emergent epistemic properties of a specific class of information-processing architectures, termed Ze systems. A Ze system is defined as an active predictive engine that operates on continuous data streams through two distinct modes: forward reading (ℱ) and retrograde encoding (ℛ). The core architectural constraint is that ℛ, the process of running predictions backward to reconcile models, necessitates the cessation of the forward information flow ℱ. We demonstrate that superposition corresponds to the system state where competing internal hypotheses remain compatible, formally defined by a small free energy difference (ΔF &lt; θ). Collapse is not a primitive event but a structured, two-stage process triggered when ΔF ≥ θ: first, the mandatory stoppage of ℱ, and second, the execution of ℛ to achieve a single, globally consistent model. Interference is shown to be a statistical signature of the coherent blending of hypotheses when they are non-distinguishable. This framework generates testable predictions across scales, from the accelerated decoherence of complex molecules to the modulation of cognitive flexibility during REM sleep. By deriving quantum phenomena from a principle of predictive inference, the theory bridges the Free Energy Principle, relational quantum mechanics, and decoherence theory, suggesting that quantumness is a universal signature of systems that must pause to look backward in order to predict the future.", "authors": [{"name": "Jaba Tkemaladze", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2026, "doi": "10.65649/93qfwv21", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W7125411505", "venue": "Longevity Horizon", "citation_count": 1, "references": ["openalex:W1854335913", "openalex:W1976804176", "openalex:W1980521192", "openalex:W1989113639", "openalex:W2026796483", "openalex:W2029898484", "openalex:W2050035613", "openalex:W2070461647", "openalex:W2071365780", "openalex:W2073384645", "openalex:W2076327464", "openalex:W2096962395", "openalex:W2099505143", "openalex:W2101692583", "openalex:W2113250069", "openalex:W2115107366", "openalex:W2123571009", "openalex:W2123869440", "openalex:W2125303188", "openalex:W2126517582", "openalex:W2128152674", "openalex:W2132003317", "openalex:W2143891888", "openalex:W2146950091", "openalex:W2147449010", "openalex:W2148764920", "openalex:W2153791616", "openalex:W2156583743", "openalex:W2157376352", "openalex:W2165092209", "openalex:W2171904973", "openalex:W2324176949", "openalex:W2949457836", "openalex:W2953319434", "openalex:W2977321575", "openalex:W3019976882", "openalex:W3036314142", "openalex:W4210576969", "openalex:W4211057129", "openalex:W4247883378", "openalex:W4392507186", "openalex:W7125390003", "openalex:W7125405807"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Myth of objectivity and the origin of symbols", "abstract": "An age-old challenge in epistemology and moral philosophy is whether objectivity exists independent of subjective perspective. Alfred North Whitehead labeled it a “fallacy of misplaced concreteness”; after all, knowledge is represented elusively in symbols. I employ the free energy principle (FEP) to argue that the belief in moral objectivity, although perhaps fallacious, amounts to an ancient and universal human myth that is essential for our symbolic capacity. To perceive any object in a world of non-diminishing (perhaps irreducible) uncertainty, according to the FEP, its constituent parts must display common probabilistic tendencies, known as statistical beliefs, prior to its interpretation, or active inference, as a stable entity. Behavioral bias, subjective emotions, and social norms scale the scope of identity by coalescing agents with otherwise disparate goals and aligning their perspectives into a coherent structure. I argue that by declaring belief in norms as objective, e.g., expressing that a particular theft or infidelity was generally wrong, our ancestors psychologically constructed a type of identity bound only by shared faith in a perspective that technically transcended individual subjectivity. Signaling explicit belief in what were previously non-symbolic norms, as seen in many non-human animals, simulates a top-down point of view of our social interactions and thereby constructs our cultural niche and symbolic capacity. I demonstrate that, largely by contrasting with overly reductive analytical models that assume individual rational pursuit of extrinsic rewards, shared belief in moral conceptions, i.e., what amounts to a religious faith, remains a motivational cornerstone of our language, economic and civic institutions, stories, and psychology. Finally, I hypothesize that our bias for familiar accents (shibboleth), plausibly represents the phylogenetic and ontogenetic contextual origins of our impulse to minimize social surprise by declaring belief in the myth of objectivity.", "authors": [{"name": "Shagor Rahman", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2023, "doi": "10.3389/fsoc.2023.1269621", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W4387459985", "venue": "Frontiers in Sociology", "citation_count": 2, "references": ["openalex:W41683454", "openalex:W229479180", "openalex:W572012434", "openalex:W595957473", "openalex:W658622296", "openalex:W826920078", "openalex:W1193784276", "openalex:W1513844058", "openalex:W1524895715", "openalex:W1536810429", "openalex:W1553256758", "openalex:W1556837482", "openalex:W1566702655", "openalex:W1574662445", "openalex:W1834590959", "openalex:W1979641707", "openalex:W1983467315", "openalex:W2002713919", "openalex:W2003644116", "openalex:W2005736153", "openalex:W2015930340", "openalex:W2016243751", "openalex:W2020506662", "openalex:W2021564806", "openalex:W2024149692", "openalex:W2028704749", "openalex:W2041992445", "openalex:W2043787485", "openalex:W2043840059", "openalex:W2055789905", "openalex:W2056493313", "openalex:W2059320470", "openalex:W2061868368", "openalex:W2068200449", "openalex:W2076580309", "openalex:W2092618205", "openalex:W2094342172", "openalex:W2099777565", "openalex:W2110258639", "openalex:W2115305054", "openalex:W2115834877", "openalex:W2116096794", "openalex:W2117308887", "openalex:W2129538603", "openalex:W2138632812", "openalex:W2154178038", "openalex:W2156109180", "openalex:W2156258831", "openalex:W2157154485", "openalex:W2305785161", "openalex:W2312262540", "openalex:W2408670836", "openalex:W2415911547", "openalex:W2484983710", "openalex:W2501578540", "openalex:W2556148253", "openalex:W2612460495", "openalex:W2616027181", "openalex:W2743911451", "openalex:W2754844655", "openalex:W2797062887", "openalex:W2800995374", "openalex:W2808334401", "openalex:W2886956600", "openalex:W2905018743", "openalex:W2908473373", "openalex:W2908555537", "openalex:W2933899145", "openalex:W2947189528", "openalex:W2952240149", "openalex:W2980655938", "openalex:W2988114478", "openalex:W2988862489", "openalex:W2989729815", "openalex:W2996530576", "openalex:W3001808890", "openalex:W3012959192", "openalex:W3025897679", "openalex:W3035509303", "openalex:W3042228302", "openalex:W3095485376", "openalex:W3099576249", "openalex:W3122768711", "openalex:W3191991819", "openalex:W3194862499", "openalex:W3199043696", "openalex:W4220746083", "openalex:W4224279946", "openalex:W4230403012", "openalex:W4237197454", "openalex:W4240175854", "openalex:W4240280763", "openalex:W4241976975", "openalex:W4247772586", "openalex:W4250018289", "openalex:W4281401161", "openalex:W4295234255", "openalex:W4306860846", "openalex:W4313069599", "openalex:W4320086004", "openalex:W4365515296", "openalex:W4399645374", "openalex:W6634503697", "openalex:W6635523610", "openalex:W6713989974", "openalex:W6995783691"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Attention and prediction in human audition: a lesson from cognitive psychophysiology", "abstract": "Abstract Attention is a hypothetical mechanism in the service of perception that facilitates the processing of relevant information and inhibits the processing of irrelevant information. Prediction is a hypothetical mechanism in the service of perception that considers prior information when interpreting the sensorial input. Although both (attention and prediction) aid perception, they are rarely considered together. Auditory attention typically yields enhanced brain activity, whereas auditory prediction often results in attenuated brain responses. However, when strongly predicted sounds are omitted, brain responses to silence resemble those elicited by sounds. Studies jointly investigating attention and prediction revealed that these different mechanisms may interact, e.g. attention may magnify the processing differences between predicted and unpredicted sounds. Following the predictive coding theory, we suggest that prediction relates to predictions sent down from predictive models housed in higher levels of the processing hierarchy to lower levels and attention refers to gain modulation of the prediction error signal sent up to the higher level. As predictions encode contents and confidence in the sensory data, and as gain can be modulated by the intention of the listener and by the predictability of the input, various possibilities for interactions between attention and prediction can be unfolded. From this perspective, the traditional distinction between bottom‐up/exogenous and top‐down/endogenous driven attention can be revisited and the classic concepts of attentional gain and attentional trace can be integrated.", "authors": [{"name": "Erich Schröger", "affiliation": "Leipzig University", "orcid": "0000-0002-8321-6629"}, {"name": "Anna Marzecová", "affiliation": "Leipzig University",

{"title": "A Unified View of “How Allostery Works”", "abstract": "The question of how allostery works was posed almost 50 years ago. Since then it has been the focus of much effort. This is for two reasons: first, the intellectual curiosity of basic science and the desire to understand fundamental phenomena, and second, its vast practical importance. Allostery is at play in all processes in the living cell, and increasingly in drug discovery. Many models have been successfully formulated, and are able to describe allostery even in the absence of a detailed structural mechanism. However, conceptual schemes designed to qualitatively explain allosteric mechanisms usually lack a quantitative mathematical model, and are unable to link its thermodynamic and structural foundations. This hampers insight into oncogenic mutations in cancer progression and biased agonists' actions. Here, we describe how allostery works from three different standpoints: thermodynamics, free energy landscape of population shift, and structure; all with exactly the same allosteric descriptors. This results in a unified view which not only clarifies the elusive allosteric mechanism but also provides structural grasp of agonist-mediated signaling pathways, and guides allosteric drug discovery. Of note, the unified view reasons that allosteric coupling (or communication) does not determine the allosteric efficacy; however, a communication channel is what makes potential binding sites allosteric.", "authors": [{"name": "Chung‐Jung Tsai", "affiliation": "National Cancer Institute", "orcid": "0000-0003-1524-9928"}, {"name": "Ruth Nussinov", "affiliation": "Leidos (United States)", "orcid": "0000-0002-8115-6415"}], "year": 2014, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003394", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W2014252415", "venue": "PLoS Computational Biology", "citation_count": 407, "references": ["openalex:W30334872", "openalex:W1594547339", "openalex:W1965835906", "openalex:W1969563735", "openalex:W1969939692", "openalex:W1972919297", "openalex:W1976266427", "openalex:W1976738153", "openalex:W1983165588", "openalex:W1986795645", "openalex:W1987582289", "openalex:W1988837867", "openalex:W1992784105", "openalex:W1998093640", "openalex:W2007832948", "openalex:W2009123297", "openalex:W2011669324", "openalex:W2014038272", "openalex:W2016386715", "openalex:W2020622784", "openalex:W2024620705", "openalex:W2026911129", "openalex:W2029745930", "openalex:W2030368884", "openalex:W2037694981", "openalex:W2037787959", "openalex:W2041205020", "openalex:W2042239308", "openalex:W2042964041", "openalex:W2045143386", "openalex:W2049682677", "openalex:W2049843026", "openalex:W2050643839", "openalex:W2053004995", "openalex:W2053717973", "openalex:W2058240476", "openalex:W2075702662", "openalex:W2083975423", "openalex:W2087565057", "openalex:W2088311925", "openalex:W2090272634", "openalex:W2094795801", "openalex:W2096345281", "openalex:W2099297532", "openalex:W2105850024", "openalex:W2106777560", "openalex:W2110810762", "openalex:W2111373319", "openalex:W2112907786", "openalex:W2113030357", "openalex:W2115152262", "openalex:W2118770079", "openalex:W2124676068", "openalex:W2141346349", "openalex:W2142544064", "openalex:W2147466870", "openalex:W2154279541", "openalex:W2158150436", "openalex:W2159756091", "openalex:W2336542886", "openalex:W2397485333", "openalex:W3025891904"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Scene Construction, Visual Foraging, and Active Inference", "abstract": "This paper describes an active inference scheme for visual searches and the perceptual synthesis entailed by scene construction. Active inference assumes that perception and action minimize variational free energy, where actions are selected to minimize the free energy expected in the future. This assumption generalizes risk-sensitive control and expected utility theory to include epistemic value; namely, the value (or salience) of information inherent in resolving uncertainty about the causes of ambiguous cues or outcomes. Here, we apply active inference to saccadic searches of a visual scene. We consider the (difficult) problem of categorizing a scene, based on the spatial relationship among visual objects where, crucially, visual cues are sampled myopically through a sequence of saccadic eye movements. This means that evidence for competing hypotheses about the scene has to be accumulated sequentially, calling upon both prediction (planning) and postdiction (memory). Our aim is to highlight some simple but fundamental aspects of the requisite functional anatomy; namely, the link between approximate Bayesian inference under mean field assumptions and functional segregation in the visual cortex. This link rests upon the (neurobiologically plausible) process theory that accompanies the normative formulation of active inference for Markov decision processes.

{"title": "‘Seeing the Dark’: Grounding Phenomenal Transparency and Opacity in Precision Estimation for Active Inference", "abstract": "One of the central claims of the Self-model Theory of Subjectivity is that the experience of being someone - even in a minimal form - arises through a transparent phenomenal self-model, which itself can in principle be reduced to brain processes. Here, we consider whether it is possible to distinguish between phenomenally transparent and opaque states in terms of active inference. We propose a relationship of phenomenal opacity to expected uncertainty or precision; i.e., the capacity for introspective attention and implicit mental action. Thus we associate introspective attention with the deployment of 'precision' that may render the perceptual evidence (for action) opaque, while treating transparency as a necessary aspect of beliefs about action, i.e., 'what I am' doing. We conclude by proposing how we may have to nuance our conception of minimal phenomenal selfhood and agency in light of this active inference conception of transparency-opacity.", "authors": [{"name": "Jakub Limanowski", "affiliation": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging", "orcid": "0000-0001-9673-5500"}, {"name": "Karl Friston", "affiliation": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging", "orcid": "0000-0001-7984-8909"}], "year": 2018, "doi": "10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00643", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W2802947734", "venue": "Frontiers in Psychology", "citation_count": 169, "references": ["openalex:W196559336", "openalex:W1482860377", "openalex:W1494456132", "openalex:W1524895715", "openalex:W1528045197", "openalex:W1594303435", "openalex:W1973056968", "openalex:W1979524373", "openalex:W1991282939", "openalex:W1994259251", "openalex:W1997558330", "openalex:W2010358983", "openalex:W2016468036", "openalex:W2017043944", "openalex:W2017522310", "openalex:W2024149692", "openalex:W2033422410", "openalex:W2035834232", "openalex:W2036216401", "openalex:W2046624418", "openalex:W2052685640", "openalex:W2077106910", "openalex:W2080654992", "openalex:W2086815053", "openalex:W2091902028", "openalex:W2095087224", "openalex:W2096962395", "openalex:W2098533845", "openalex:W2101744684", "openalex:W2103176783", "openalex:W2119600275", "openalex:W2120079537", "openalex:W2123611655", "openalex:W2125191661", "openalex:W2126233790", "openalex:W2127958135", "openalex:W2130195834", "openalex:W2132960888", "openalex:W2135840784", "openalex:W2140487181", "openalex:W2142672241", "openalex:W2147617226", "openalex:W2148544865", "openalex:W2148764920", "openalex:W2151496011", "openalex:W2151582777", "openalex:W2160195521", "openalex:W2276275925", "openalex:W2277780286", "openalex:W2344384217", "openalex:W2492481216", "openalex:W2521669314", "openalex:W2530226740", "openalex:W2552810632", "openalex:W2560229246", "openalex:W2563109517", "openalex:W2564601941", "openalex:W2603171575", "openalex:W2606488938", "openalex:W2607344273", "openalex:W2618615166", "openalex:W2620332686", "openalex:W2623066203", "openalex:W2701645347", "openalex:W2744535290", "openalex:W2765383588", "openalex:W2765831433", "openalex:W2768212097", "openalex:W2769704218", "openalex:W2783657280", "openalex:W2885863838", "openalex:W2913830908", "openalex:W2973222891", "openalex:W4234821997", "openalex:W4242945207", "openalex:W4247883378", "openalex:W6607957900", "openalex:W6735652675", "openalex:W6736373855", "openalex:W6739972304", "openalex:W6753540925", "openalex:W6907898498", "openalex:W6945526307"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Rhythmic complexity and predictive coding: a novel approach to modeling rhythm and meter perception in music", "abstract": "Musical rhythm, consisting of apparently abstract intervals of accented temporal events, has a remarkable capacity to move our minds and bodies. How does the cognitive system enable our experiences of rhythmically complex music? In this paper, we describe some common forms of rhythmic complexity in music and propose the theory of predictive coding (PC) as a framework for understanding how rhythm and rhythmic complexity are processed in the brain. We also consider why we feel so compelled by rhythmic tension in music. First, we consider theories of rhythm and meter perception, which provide hierarchical and computational approaches to modeling. Second, we present the theory of PC, which posits a hierarchical organization of brain responses reflecting fundamental, survival-related mechanisms associated with predicting future events. According to this theory, perception and learning is manifested through the brain's Bayesian minimization of the error between the input to the brain and the brain's prior expectations. Third, we develop a PC model of musical rhythm, in which rhythm perception is conceptualized as an interaction between what is heard (\"rhythm\") and the brain's anticipatory structuring of music (\"meter\"). Finally, we review empirical studies of the neural and behavioral effects of syncopation, polyrhythm and groove, and propose how these studies can be seen as special cases of the PC theory. We argue that musical rhythm exploits the brain's general principles of prediction and propose that pleasure and desire for sensorimotor synchronization from musical rhythm may be a result of such mechanisms.", "authors": [{"name": "Peter Vuust", "affiliation": "Aarhus University Hospital", "orcid": "0000-0002-4908-735X"}, {"name": "Maria A.

{"title": "A Dual Role for Prediction Error in Associative Learning", "abstract": "Confronted with a rich sensory environment, the brain must learn statistical regularities across sensory domains to construct causal models of the world. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging and dynamic causal modeling (DCM) to furnish neurophysiological evidence that statistical associations are learnt, even when task-irrelevant. Subjects performed an audio-visual target-detection task while being exposed to distractor stimuli. Unknown to them, auditory distractors predicted the presence or absence of subsequent visual distractors. We modeled incidental learning of these associations using a Rescorla-Wagner (RW) model. Activity in primary visual cortex and putamen reflected learning-dependent surprise: these areas responded progressively more to unpredicted, and progressively less to predicted visual stimuli. Critically, this prediction-error response was observed even when the absence of a visual stimulus was surprising. We investigated the underlying mechanism by embedding the RW model into a DCM to show that auditory to visual connectivity changed significantly over time as a function of prediction error. Thus, consistent with predictive coding models of perception, associative learning is mediated by prediction-error dependent changes in connectivity. These results posit a dual role for prediction-error in encoding surprise and driving associative plasticity.", "authors": [{"name": "Hanneke E.M. den Ouden", "affiliation": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging", "orcid": "0000-0001-7039-5130"}, {"name": "Karl Friston", "affiliation": "UCL Australia", "orcid": "0000-0001-7984-8909"}, {"name": "Nathaniel D.

{"title": "The Hard Problem of Consciousness and the Free Energy Principle", "abstract": "This article applies the free energy principle to the hard problem of consciousness. After clarifying some philosophical issues concerning functionalism, it identifies the elemental form of consciousness as <i>affect</i> and locates its physiological mechanism (an extended form of homeostasis) in the upper brainstem. This mechanism is then formalized in terms of free energy minimization (in unpredicted contexts) where decreases and increases in expected uncertainty are felt as pleasure and unpleasure, respectively. Emphasis is placed on the reasons why such existential imperatives <i>feel like something</i> to and for an organism.", "authors": [{"name": "Mark Solms", "affiliation": "University of Cape Town", "orcid": "0000-0003-4828-3882"}], "year": 2019, "doi": "10.3389/fpsyg.2018.02714", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W2905018743", "venue": "Frontiers in Psychology", "citation_count": 191, "references": ["openalex:W174748666", "openalex:W200020848", "openalex:W649228844", "openalex:W1509643880", "openalex:W1513765680", "openalex:W1570699532", "openalex:W1608785134", "openalex:W1809188141", "openalex:W1968799970", "openalex:W1972996138", "openalex:W1980338610", "openalex:W1988878611", "openalex:W2012176474", "openalex:W2014085266", "openalex:W2016521818", "openalex:W2022333848", "openalex:W2025175321", "openalex:W2034450065", "openalex:W2043919213", "openalex:W2045226019", "openalex:W2055789905", "openalex:W2059958122", "openalex:W2072267104", "openalex:W2095596789", "openalex:W2098766452", "openalex:W2103994288", "openalex:W2105911464", "openalex:W2107557962", "openalex:W2130142026", "openalex:W2133682902", "openalex:W2149514160", "openalex:W2165031188", "openalex:W2166891515", "openalex:W2168462263", "openalex:W2170192957", "openalex:W2286883861", "openalex:W2335468251", "openalex:W2397315869", "openalex:W2419438565", "openalex:W2481219889", "openalex:W2490558748", "openalex:W2519649706", "openalex:W2560094789", "openalex:W2588736771", "openalex:W2740055348", "openalex:W2793276175", "openalex:W2867035005", "openalex:W2902215602", "openalex:W2975220955", "openalex:W2975648870", "openalex:W2980693601", "openalex:W3008146034", "openalex:W3011976414", "openalex:W3027798348", "openalex:W3202030447", "openalex:W3210699874", "openalex:W4237024493", "openalex:W4241976975", "openalex:W4242323100", "openalex:W4247883378", "openalex:W4251731575", "openalex:W4388248103", "openalex:W4388250061", "openalex:W4388395465", "openalex:W6636017328", "openalex:W6653975771", "openalex:W6683472420", "openalex:W6692106974", "openalex:W6696028755", "openalex:W6767302101", "openalex:W6768633755", "openalex:W6824674084"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Virtual reality and consciousness inference in dreaming", "abstract": "This article explores the notion that the brain is genetically endowed with an innate virtual reality generator that - through experience-dependent plasticity - becomes a generative or predictive model of the world. This model, which is most clearly revealed in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep dreaming, may provide the theater for conscious experience. Functional neuroimaging evidence for brain activations that are time-locked to rapid eye movements (REMs) endorses the view that waking consciousness emerges from REM sleep - and dreaming lays the foundations for waking perception. In this view, the brain is equipped with a virtual model of the world that generates predictions of its sensations. This model is continually updated and entrained by sensory prediction errors in wakefulness to ensure veridical perception, but not in dreaming. In contrast, dreaming plays an essential role in maintaining and enhancing the capacity to model the world by minimizing model complexity and thereby maximizing both statistical and thermodynamic efficiency. This perspective suggests that consciousness corresponds to the embodied process of inference, realized through the generation of virtual realities (in both sleep and wakefulness). In short, our premise or hypothesis is that the waking brain engages with the world to predict the causes of sensations, while in sleep the brain's generative model is actively refined so that it generates more efficient predictions during waking. We review the evidence in support of this hypothesis - evidence that grounds consciousness in biophysical computations whose neuronal and neurochemical infrastructure has been disclosed by sleep research.", "authors": [{"name": "J.

{"title": "The Social Modulation of Pain: Others as Predictive Signals of Salience – a Systematic Review", "abstract": "Several studies in cognitive neuroscience have investigated the cognitive and affective modulation of pain. By contrast, fewer studies have focused on the social modulation of pain, despite a plethora of relevant clinical findings. Here we present the first review of experimental studies addressing how interpersonal factors, such as the presence, behavior, and spatial proximity of an observer, modulate pain. Based on a systematic literature search, we identified 26 studies on experimentally induced pain that manipulated different interpersonal variables and measured behavioral, physiological, and neural pain-related responses. We observed that the modulation of pain by interpersonal factors depended on (1) the degree to which the social partners were active or were perceived by the participants to possess possibility for action; (2) the degree to which participants could perceive the specific intentions of the social partners; (3) the type of pre-existing relationship between the social partner and the person in pain, and lastly, (4) individual differences in relating to others and coping styles. Based on these findings, we propose that the modulation of pain by social factors can be fruitfully understood in relation to a recent predictive coding model, the free energy framework, particularly as applied to interoception and social cognition. Specifically, we argue that interpersonal interactions during pain may function as social, predictive signals of contextual threat or safety and as such influence the salience of noxious stimuli. The perception of such interpersonal interactions may in turn depend on (a) prior beliefs about interpersonal relating and (b) the certainty or precision by which an interpersonal interaction may predict environmental threat or safety.", "authors": [{"name": "Charlotte Krahé", "affiliation": "King's College London", "orcid": "0000-0002-0620-1263"}, {"name": "Anne Springer", "affiliation": "University of Potsdam", "orcid": "0000-0001-7881-3755"}, {"name": "John Weinman", "affiliation": "King's College London", "orcid": "0000-0002-6786-0166"}, {"name": "Aikaterini Fotopoulou", "affiliation": "University College London", "orcid": "0000-0003-0904-7967"}], "year": 2013, "doi": "10.3389/fnhum.2013.00386", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W2133333909", "venue": "Frontiers in Human Neuroscience", "citation_count": 246, "references": ["openalex:W1500532393", "openalex:W1507573241", "openalex:W1556541525", "openalex:W1706861413", "openalex:W1797402740", "openalex:W1849553904", "openalex:W1964899388", "openalex:W1965478461", "openalex:W1966677887", "openalex:W1966763047", "openalex:W1967205531", "openalex:W1967379942", "openalex:W1967830590", "openalex:W1968003444", "openalex:W1969054157", "openalex:W1971234484", "openalex:W1972687385", "openalex:W1973011094", "openalex:W1976859826", "openalex:W1977385640", "openalex:W1978960460", "openalex:W1979732124", "openalex:W1982017466", "openalex:W1984450149", "openalex:W1988055799", "openalex:W1989308633", "openalex:W1989971220", "openalex:W1991729388", "openalex:W1994841627", "openalex:W1995002349", "openalex:W1997524205", "openalex:W1999662809", "openalex:W2001061467", "openalex:W2001839966", "openalex:W2002958204", "openalex:W2003628930", "openalex:W2005043307", "openalex:W2006789534", "openalex:W2007426292", "openalex:W2011614166", "openalex:W2013670608", "openalex:W2016521818", "openalex:W2017323063", "openalex:W2017737013", "openalex:W2018100360", "openalex:W2018459912", "openalex:W2020176769", "openalex:W2020701398", "openalex:W2026602454", "openalex:W2027331274", "openalex:W2028074742", "openalex:W2028841195", "openalex:W2031410737", "openalex:W2032292825", "openalex:W2032652882", "openalex:W2038599853", "openalex:W2040047870", "openalex:W2040084483", "openalex:W2041265714", "openalex:W2042837986", "openalex:W2053571806", "openalex:W2053788108", "openalex:W2055761781", "openalex:W2060645796", "openalex:W2061226698", "openalex:W2068200107", "openalex:W2070373913", "openalex:W2073432353", "openalex:W2076573082", "openalex:W2077254755", "openalex:W2078581272", "openalex:W2079957063", "openalex:W2082310821", "openalex:W2082352243", "openalex:W2083799223", "openalex:W2086623405", "openalex:W2086963885", "openalex:W2088740067", "openalex:W2089225124", "openalex:W2092073393", "openalex:W2093663252", "openalex:W2096578021", "openalex:W2096962395", "openalex:W2099493839", "openalex:W2101486318", "openalex:W2102207042", "openalex:W2107390095", "openalex:W2109933817", "openalex:W2110247921", "openalex:W2111005252", "openalex:W2112250788", "openalex:W2113653767", "openalex:W2114301646", "openalex:W2116658855", "openalex:W2119847000", "openalex:W2119885245", "openalex:W2121090957", "openalex:W2122697928", "openalex:W2123466071", "openalex:W2125635982", "openalex:W2128765821", "openalex:W2131045394", "openalex:W2131443869", "openalex:W2132708207", "openalex:W2141093480", "openalex:W2141609058", "openalex:W2141610063", "openalex:W2142213531", "openalex:W2142823391", "openalex:W2143072217", "openalex:W2146664695", "openalex:W2147985239", "openalex:W2157376352", "openalex:W2158420012", "openalex:W2160195521", "openalex:W2161577472", "openalex:W2162012761", "openalex:W2162060678", "openalex:W2163081513", "openalex:W2164510317", "openalex:W2164861154", "openalex:W2165864909", "openalex:W2165883673", "openalex:W2166164817", "openalex:W2166228838", "openalex:W2166503734", "openalex:W2171518803", "openalex:W2175873029", "openalex:W2186385505", "openalex:W2331198226", "openalex:W2460048842", "openalex:W2624653302", "openalex:W3215953092", "openalex:W4230525824", "openalex:W4232948727", "openalex:W4244925768", "openalex:W4245213632", "openalex:W4246830980", "openalex:W4253378603", "openalex:W4253436400", "openalex:W4253600352", "openalex:W4288400169", "openalex:W4301121815", "openalex:W4392145873", "openalex:W6642185580", "openalex:W6642378514", "openalex:W6643518612", "openalex:W6645011386", "openalex:W6649018789", "openalex:W6676183827", "openalex:W6676818625", "openalex:W6681027126", "openalex:W6739449775", "openalex:W6807968058", "openalex:W6989522895", "openalex:W7018895964", "openalex:W7073757229"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Active Inference, Attention, and Motor Preparation", "abstract": "Perception is the foundation of cognition and is fundamental to our beliefs and consequent action planning. The Editorial (this issue) asks: \"what mechanisms, if any, mediate between perceptual and cognitive processes?\" It has recently been argued that attention might furnish such a mechanism. In this paper, we pursue the idea that action planning (motor preparation) is an attentional phenomenon directed toward kinesthetic signals. This rests on a view of motor control as active inference, where predictions of proprioceptive signals are fulfilled by peripheral motor reflexes. If valid, active inference suggests that attention should not be limited to the optimal biasing of perceptual signals in the exteroceptive (e.g., visual) domain but should also bias proprioceptive signals during movement. Here, we investigate this idea using a classical attention (Posner) paradigm cast in a motor setting. Specially, we looked for decreases in reaction times when movements were preceded by valid relative to invalid cues. Furthermore, we addressed the hierarchical level at which putative attentional effects were expressed by independently cueing the nature of the movement and the hand used to execute it. We found a significant interaction between the validity of movement and effector cues on reaction times. This suggests that attentional bias might be mediated at a low level in the motor hierarchy, in an intrinsic frame of reference. This finding is consistent with attentional enabling of top-down predictions of proprioceptive input and may rely upon the same synaptic mechanisms that mediate directed spatial attention in the visual system.", "authors": [{"name": "Harriet R.

{"title": "A Thermodynamic State Inequality for Autopoietic Intelligence", "abstract": "This preprint develops a local thermodynamic state inequality for autopoietic intelligence: open, far-from-equilibrium information-processing systems that use incoming energy to maintain structure, reliability, and semantically meaningful internal dynamics. Instead of assuming a linear, additive power budget, the paper introduces a nonlinear total power functional PtotP_{\\mathrm{tot}}Ptot over coupled process coordinates (structural organisation, persistence, semantic processing, tagging, reference updating, value updating), motivated by stochastic and nonequilibrium thermodynamics. By analysing supporting hyperplanes of PtotP_{\\mathrm{tot}}Ptot around a given operating regime, the work derives a local state inequality linking effective energy influx to three core autopoietic quantities: relative structural order, a persistence potential derived from self-measured failure statistics, and a viability-based semantic rate. Semantic activity is defined in terms of internal prediction of viability rather than an externally imposed “true” future, implementing a strictly no-meta observability stance. A viability-based semantic rate Σsemviab\\Sigma_{\\mathrm{sem}}^{\\mathrm{viab}}Σsemviab is built from conditional mutual information between internal semantic classes and an internal viability proxy, and information-thermodynamic arguments yield a lower bound relating this rate to the power PsemP_{\\mathrm{sem}}Psem required for semantic processing, with an architecture-dependent predictive efficiency parameter ηpred\\eta_{\\mathrm{pred}}ηpred. Tagging, dynamic reference frames, and an evolving internal value field are treated as physical subsystems with their own Landauer-type costs, closing Maxwell-demon loopholes. In a dimensionless form, the inequality defines a feasible allocation simplex for structural, persistence, and predictive-semantic expenditures of effective power, leaving a free semantic margin that can be filled by internally valued semantics such as play, exploration, and art. The framework clarifies how survival-oriented and non-utilitarian meanings can coexist in physically realistic, self-modifying intelligent systems, and it is explicitly compared to—but not reduced to—Free-Energy Principle and active inference approaches to adaptive agents and AI.", "authors": [{"name": "Takahashi, K", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0009-0004-4273-3365"}], "year": 2025, "doi": "10.5281/zenodo.17873550", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W7114767399", "venue": "Zenodo (CERN European Organization for Nuclear Research)", "citation_count": 2, "references": [], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "A Neuronal Model of Predictive Coding Accounting for the Mismatch Negativity", "abstract": "The mismatch negativity (MMN) is thought to index the activation of specialized neural networks for active prediction and deviance detection. However, a detailed neuronal model of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the MMN is still lacking, and its computational foundations remain debated. We propose here a detailed neuronal model of auditory cortex, based on predictive coding, that accounts for the critical features of MMN. The model is entirely composed of spiking excitatory and inhibitory neurons interconnected in a layered cortical architecture with distinct input, predictive, and prediction error units. A spike-timing dependent learning rule, relying upon NMDA receptor synaptic transmission, allows the network to adjust its internal predictions and use a memory of the recent past inputs to anticipate on future stimuli based on transition statistics. We demonstrate that this simple architecture can account for the major empirical properties of the MMN. These include a frequency-dependent response to rare deviants, a response to unexpected repeats in alternating sequences (ABABA A …), a lack of consideration of the global sequence context, a response to sound omission, and a sensitivity of the MMN to NMDA receptor antagonists. Novel predictions are presented, and a new magnetoencephalography experiment in healthy human subjects is presented that validates our key hypothesis: the MMN results from active cortical prediction rather than passive synaptic habituation.", "authors": [{"name": "Catherine Wacongne", "affiliation": "Commissariat à l'Énergie Atomique et aux Énergies Alternatives", "orcid": null}, {"name": "Jean‐Pierre Changeux", "affiliation": "Collège de France", "orcid": "0000-0003-0297-1583"}, {"name": "Stanislas Dehaene", "affiliation": "Cognitive Neuroimaging Lab", "orcid": "0000-0002-7418-8275"}], "year": 2012, "doi": "10.1523/jneurosci.5003-11.2012", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W1977683420", "venue": "Journal of Neuroscience", "citation_count": 557, "references": ["openalex:W1641769423", "openalex:W1963576035", "openalex:W1964934384", "openalex:W1966897368", "openalex:W1968600772", "openalex:W1974840272", "openalex:W1975141160", "openalex:W1975764941", "openalex:W1980131199", "openalex:W1981343716", "openalex:W1982395728", "openalex:W1983583284", "openalex:W1994044313", "openalex:W1995852935", "openalex:W1996141026", "openalex:W1997844067", "openalex:W1998708317", "openalex:W2001921661", "openalex:W2010772505", "openalex:W2016554514", "openalex:W2017040534", "openalex:W2022775623", "openalex:W2037478258", "openalex:W2039448771", "openalex:W2039984531", "openalex:W2039992474", "openalex:W2043161845", "openalex:W2045507876", "openalex:W2049328501", "openalex:W2050062133", "openalex:W2051203024", "openalex:W2052805224", "openalex:W2056988564", "openalex:W2058368564", "openalex:W2059225874", "openalex:W2060366056", "openalex:W2061148423", "openalex:W2061637827", "openalex:W2062987340", "openalex:W2065750611", "openalex:W2068591890", "openalex:W2069474802", "openalex:W2070813962", "openalex:W2076231092", "openalex:W2076277079", "openalex:W2077086984", "openalex:W2078485646", "openalex:W2080067400", "openalex:W2082501703", "openalex:W2087649546", "openalex:W2090808068", "openalex:W2091351732", "openalex:W2093397301", "openalex:W2094681793", "openalex:W2097652643", "openalex:W2103179919", "openalex:W2116533103", "openalex:W2117010174", "openalex:W2117726420", "openalex:W2119845553", "openalex:W2119885245", "openalex:W2120238402", "openalex:W2121863487", "openalex:W2125663122", "openalex:W2127793360", "openalex:W2127958135", "openalex:W2145695390", "openalex:W2147008239", "openalex:W2154354257", "openalex:W2157111422", "openalex:W2158696116", "openalex:W2158951270", "openalex:W2161996678", "openalex:W2162913744", "openalex:W2164653071", "openalex:W2166902549", "openalex:W2418152387", "openalex:W4214717370", "openalex:W4233503374", "openalex:W4253613142", "openalex:W6655557675"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Computational Psychiatry: towards a mathematically informed understanding of mental illness", "abstract": "Computational Psychiatry aims to describe the relationship between the brain's neurobiology, its environment and mental symptoms in computational terms. In so doing, it may improve psychiatric classification and the diagnosis and treatment of mental illness. It can unite many levels of description in a mechanistic and rigorous fashion, while avoiding biological reductionism and artificial categorisation. We describe how computational models of cognition can infer the current state of the environment and weigh up future actions, and how these models provide new perspectives on two example disorders, depression and schizophrenia. Reinforcement learning describes how the brain can choose and value courses of actions according to their long-term future value. Some depressive symptoms may result from aberrant valuations, which could arise from prior beliefs about the loss of agency ('helplessness'), or from an inability to inhibit the mental exploration of aversive events. Predictive coding explains how the brain might perform Bayesian inference about the state of its environment by combining sensory data with prior beliefs, each weighted according to their certainty (or precision). Several cortical abnormalities in schizophrenia might reduce precision at higher levels of the inferential hierarchy, biasing inference towards sensory data and away from prior beliefs. We discuss whether striatal hyperdopaminergia might have an adaptive function in this context, and also how reinforcement learning and incentive salience models may shed light on the disorder. Finally, we review some of Computational Psychiatry's applications to neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, and some pitfalls to avoid when applying its methods.", "authors": [{"name": "Rick A.

{"title": "Predictive Top-Down Integration of Prior Knowledge during Speech Perception", "abstract": "A striking feature of human perception is that our subjective experience depends not only on sensory information from the environment but also on our prior knowledge or expectations. The precise mechanisms by which sensory information and prior knowledge are integrated remain unclear, with longstanding disagreement concerning whether integration is strictly feedforward or whether higher-level knowledge influences sensory processing through feedback connections. Here we used concurrent EEG and MEG recordings to determine how sensory information and prior knowledge are integrated in the brain during speech perception. We manipulated listeners' prior knowledge of speech content by presenting matching, mismatching, or neutral written text before a degraded (noise-vocoded) spoken word. When speech conformed to prior knowledge, subjective perceptual clarity was enhanced. This enhancement in clarity was associated with a spatiotemporal profile of brain activity uniquely consistent with a feedback process: activity in the inferior frontal gyrus was modulated by prior knowledge before activity in lower-level sensory regions of the superior temporal gyrus. In parallel, we parametrically varied the level of speech degradation, and therefore the amount of sensory detail, so that changes in neural responses attributable to sensory information and prior knowledge could be directly compared. Although sensory detail and prior knowledge both enhanced speech clarity, they had an opposite influence on the evoked response in the superior temporal gyrus. We argue that these data are best explained within the framework of predictive coding in which sensory activity is compared with top-down predictions and only unexplained activity propagated through the cortical hierarchy.", "authors": [{"name": "Ediz Sohoglu", "affiliation": "Medical Research Council", "orcid": "0000-0002-0755-6445"}, {"name": "Jonathan E.

{"title": "Neuropragmatism, Neuropsychoanalysis, Therapeutic Trends, and the Care Crisis", "abstract": "Neuropragmatism offers a non-dualistic conception of experience from which scientific inquiries can provide resources for sociocultural critique. This reconstructive effort addresses what Emma Dowling calls the care crisis without succumbing to what Mike W. Martin calls therapeutic tyranny. This tyranny relies on problematic dualisms, between mind/body, mind/world, and fact/value, that are also found in neuropsychoanalysis. While pragmatism and psychoanalysis more generally share an evolutionary perspective and can overlap in therapeutic approaches, neuropsychoanalysis diverges from this effort in its dual-aspect monism and positivistic conception of science. Where neuropsychoanalysis seeks to reconcile the first-person subjectivity of lived experience with the third-person objectivity of science, neuropragmatism offers reconstruction. In taking the neuropragmatic turn, neuropsychoanalysts can better utilize Freudian therapies in conjunction with active inference principles, such as the free-energy principle and allostasis. Along with neuropragmatism’s conception of experience as organism-environment dynamic engagement, neuropsychoanalysis can benefit from allostatic approaches to experience and inquiry without reducing experience to brute mechanism or denying the utility of such mechanisms for prediction and intervention. Understanding the value-ladenness of experience, primary and secondary, in everyday waking life and in reflective inquiry, empowers people to better care for themselves without succumbing to merely coping with neoliberal oppression.", "authors": [{"name": "Tïbor Solymosi", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0001-9393-116X"}], "year": 2023, "doi": "10.4000/ejpap.3590", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W4387642122", "venue": "European Journal of Pragmatism and American Philosophy", "citation_count": 1, "references": ["openalex:W71761313", "openalex:W324769695", "openalex:W1536468369", "openalex:W1984517957", "openalex:W1986230743", "openalex:W1998399295", "openalex:W2058020857", "openalex:W2107557962", "openalex:W2148764920", "openalex:W2163341414", "openalex:W2187728318", "openalex:W2478072222", "openalex:W2489639866", "openalex:W2496471150", "openalex:W2511836425", "openalex:W2618517468", "openalex:W2900351545", "openalex:W3216248131", "openalex:W4226400653", "openalex:W4231482993", "openalex:W4233522785", "openalex:W4235271752", "openalex:W4236728048", "openalex:W4238980349", "openalex:W4241856266", "openalex:W4246743475", "openalex:W4247898303", "openalex:W4248198257", "openalex:W4251348230", "openalex:W4252681508", "openalex:W4312037627", "openalex:W4323051435", "openalex:W4366316052", "openalex:W6721173417", "openalex:W6759452832", "openalex:W6844047011"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Recent advances in the application of predictive coding and active inference models within clinical neuroscience", "abstract": "Research in clinical neuroscience is founded on the idea that a better understanding of brain (dys)function will improve our ability to diagnose and treat neurological and psychiatric disorders. In recent years, neuroscience has converged on the notion that the brain is a ‘prediction machine,’ in that it actively predicts the sensory input that it will receive if one or another course of action is chosen. These predictions are used to select actions that will (most often, and in the long run) maintain the body within the narrow range of physiological states consistent with survival. This insight has given rise to an area of clinical computational neuroscience research that focuses on characterizing neural circuit architectures that can accomplish these predictive functions, and on how the associated processes may break down or become aberrant within clinical conditions. Here, we provide a brief review of examples of recent work on the application of predictive processing models of brain function to study clinical (psychiatric) disorders, with the aim of highlighting current directions and their potential clinical utility. We offer examples of recent conceptual models, formal mathematical models, and applications of such models in empirical research in clinical populations, with a focus on making this material accessible to clinicians without expertise in computational neuroscience. In doing so, we aim to highlight the potential insights and opportunities that understanding the brain as a prediction machine may offer to clinical research and practice.", "authors": [{"name": "Ryan Smith", "affiliation": "Laureate Institute for Brain Research", "orcid": "0000-0002-4448-185X"}, {"name": "Paul B.

{"title": "Expectation and Attention in Hierarchical Auditory Prediction", "abstract": "Hierarchical predictive coding suggests that attention in humans emerges from increased precision in probabilistic inference, whereas expectation biases attention in favor of contextually anticipated stimuli. We test these notions within auditory perception by independently manipulating top-down expectation and attentional precision alongside bottom-up stimulus predictability. Our findings support an integrative interpretation of commonly observed electrophysiological signatures of neurodynamics, namely mismatch negativity (MMN), P300, and contingent negative variation (CNV), as manifestations along successive levels of predictive complexity. Early first-level processing indexed by the MMN was sensitive to stimulus predictability: here, attentional precision enhanced early responses, but explicit top-down expectation diminished it. This pattern was in contrast to later, second-level processing indexed by the P300: although sensitive to the degree of predictability, responses at this level were contingent on attentional engagement and in fact sharpened by top-down expectation. At the highest level, the drift of the CNV was a fine-grained marker of top-down expectation itself. Source reconstruction of high-density EEG, supported by intracranial recordings, implicated temporal and frontal regions differentially active at early and late levels. The cortical generators of the CNV suggested that it might be involved in facilitating the consolidation of context-salient stimuli into conscious perception. These results provide convergent empirical support to promising recent accounts of attention and expectation in predictive coding.", "authors": [{"name": "Srivas Chennu", "affiliation": "University of Cambridge", "orcid": "0000-0002-6840-2941"}, {"name": "Valdas Noreika", "affiliation": "Medical Research Council", "orcid": "0000-0003-0492-6954"}, {"name": "David Gueorguiev", "affiliation": "Medical Research Council", "orcid": "0000-0002-2833-0437"}, {"name": "Alejandro O.

{"title": "Predictive processing as a systematic basis for identifying the neural correlates of consciousness", "abstract": "The search for the neural correlates of consciousness is in need of a systematic, principled foundation that can endow putative neural correlates with greater predictive and explanatory value. Here, we propose the predictive processing framework for brain function as a promising candidate for providing this systematic foundation. The proposal is motivated by that framework’s ability to address three general challenges to identifying the neural correlates of consciousness, and to satisfy two constraints common to many theories of consciousness. Implementing the search for neural correlates of consciousness through the lens of predictive processing delivers strong potential for predictive and explanatory value through detailed, systematic mappings between neural substrates and phenomenological structure. We conclude that the predictive processing framework, precisely because it at the outset is not itself a theory of consciousness, has significant potential for advancing the neuroscience of consciousness.", "authors": [{"name": "Jakob Hohwy", "affiliation": "Australian Regenerative Medicine Institute", "orcid": "0000-0003-3906-3060"}, {"name": "Anil K.

Omitting the prior leads to the standard KL‐NMF algorithms as special cases, where maximum likelihood parameter estimation is carried out via the Expectation‐Maximisation (EM) algorithm. Starting from this view, we develop full Bayesian inference via variational Bayes or Monte Carlo. Our construction retains conjugacy and enables us to develop more powerful models while retaining attractive features of standard NMF such as monotonic convergence and easy implementation.

{"title": "SKEMPI: a Structural Kinetic and Energetic database of Mutant Protein Interactions and its use in empirical models", "abstract": "Abstract Motivation: Empirical models for the prediction of how changes in sequence alter protein–protein binding kinetics and thermodynamics can garner insights into many aspects of molecular biology. However, such models require empirical training data and proper validation before they can be widely applied. Previous databases contained few stabilizing mutations and no discussion of their inherent biases or how this impacts model construction or validation. Results: We present SKEMPI, a database of 3047 binding free energy changes upon mutation assembled from the scientific literature, for protein–protein heterodimeric complexes with experimentally determined structures. This represents over four times more data than previously collected. Changes in 713 association and dissociation rates and 127 enthalpies and entropies were also recorded. The existence of biases towards specific mutations, residues, interfaces, proteins and protein families is discussed in the context of how the data can be used to construct predictive models.

{"title": "An Active Inference Approach to Interoceptive Psychopathology", "abstract": "Interoception refers to the process by which the nervous system senses and integrates signals originating from within the body, providing a momentary mapping of the body's internal landscape and its relationship to the outside world. Active inference is based on the premise that afferent sensory input to the brain is constantly shaped and modified by prior expectations. In this review we propose that interoceptive psychopathology results from two primary interoceptive dysfunctions: First, individuals have abnormally strong expectations of the situations that elicit bodily change (i.e., hyperprecise priors), and second, they have great difficulty adjusting these expectations when the environment changes (i.e., context rigidity). Here we discuss how these dysfunctions potentially manifest in mental illness and how interventions aimed at altering interoceptive processing can help the brain create a more realistic model of its internal state.", "authors": [{"name": "Martin P.

{"title": "The role of the salience network in cognitive and affective deficits", "abstract": "Analysis and interpretation of studies on cognitive and affective dysregulation often draw upon the network paradigm, especially the Triple Network Model, which consists of the default mode network (DMN), the frontoparietal network (FPN), and the salience network (SN). DMN activity is primarily dominant during cognitive leisure and self-monitoring processes. The FPN peaks during task involvement and cognitive exertion. Meanwhile, the SN serves as a dynamic “switch” between the DMN and FPN, in line with salience and cognitive demand. In the cognitive and affective domains, dysfunctions involving SN activity are connected to a broad spectrum of deficits and maladaptive behavioral patterns in a variety of clinical disorders, such as depression, insomnia, narcissism, PTSD (in the case of SN hyperactivity), chronic pain, and anxiety, high degrees of neuroticism, schizophrenia, epilepsy, autism, and neurodegenerative illnesses, bipolar disorder (in the case of SN hypoactivity). We discuss behavioral and neurological data from various research domains and present an integrated perspective indicating that these conditions can be associated with a widespread disruption in predictive coding at multiple hierarchical levels. We delineate the fundamental ideas of the brain network paradigm and contrast them with the conventional modular method in the first section of this article. Following this, we outline the interaction model of the key functional brain networks and highlight recent studies coupling SN-related dysfunctions with cognitive and affective impairments.", "authors": [{"name": "J.

{"title": "Action-rule-based cognitive control enables efficient execution of stimulus–response conflict tasks: a model validation of Simon task performance", "abstract": "Introduction The human brain can flexibly modify behavioral rules to optimize task performance (speed and accuracy) by minimizing cognitive load. To show this flexibility, we propose an action-rule-based cognitive control (ARC) model. The ARC model was based on a stochastic framework consistent with an active inference of the free energy principle, combined with schematic brain network systems regulated by the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), to develop several hypotheses for demonstrating the validity of the ARC model. Methods A step-motion Simon task was developed involving congruence or incongruence between important symbolic information (illustration of a foot labeled “L” or “R,” where “L” requests left and “R” requests right foot movement) and irrelevant spatial information (whether the illustration is actually of a left or right foot). We made predictions for behavioral and brain responses to testify to the theoretical predictions. Results Task responses combined with event-related deep-brain activity (ER-DBA) measures demonstrated a key contribution of the dACC in this process and provided evidence for the main prediction that the dACC could reduce the Shannon surprise term in the free energy formula by internally reversing the irrelevant rapid anticipatory postural adaptation. We also found sequential effects with modulated dip depths of ER-DBA waveforms that support the prediction that repeated stimuli with the same congruency can promote remodeling of the internal model through the information gain term while counterbalancing the surprise term. Discussion Overall, our results were consistent with experimental predictions, which may support the validity of the ARC model. The sequential effect accompanied by dip modulation of ER-DBA waveforms suggests that cognitive cost is saved while maintaining cognitive performance in accordance with the framework of the ARC based on 1-bit congruency-dependent selective control.", "authors": [{"name": "Yoshitaka Otani", "affiliation": "Kobe International University", "orcid": "0000-0002-1405-9674"}, {"name": "Yoshitada Katagiri", "affiliation": "The University of Tokyo", "orcid": null}, {"name": "Emiko Imai", "affiliation": "Kobe University", "orcid": null}, {"name": "Hisatomo Kowa", "affiliation": "Kobe University", "orcid": "0000-0002-5300-8589"}], "year": 2023, "doi": "10.3389/fnhum.2023.1239207", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W4388729117", "venue": "Frontiers in Human Neuroscience", "citation_count": 1, "references": ["openalex:W1530571642", "openalex:W1532921825", "openalex:W1729600369", "openalex:W1869902417", "openalex:W1967116710", "openalex:W1967847233", "openalex:W1971594021", "openalex:W1974967176", "openalex:W1981331769", "openalex:W1985327429", "openalex:W1985614484", "openalex:W1989637222", "openalex:W1993657271", "openalex:W1995875735", "openalex:W1998249115", "openalex:W1998583946", "openalex:W2001711230", "openalex:W2003401485", "openalex:W2004990666", "openalex:W2006682502", "openalex:W2014345907", "openalex:W2015982946", "openalex:W2023890362", "openalex:W2025136857", "openalex:W2033775113", "openalex:W2035090004", "openalex:W2043449216", "openalex:W2044399139", "openalex:W2045273697", "openalex:W2048618958", "openalex:W2048996569", "openalex:W2049844151", "openalex:W2052524465", "openalex:W2054521507", "openalex:W2056868975", "openalex:W2064257383", "openalex:W2074058537", "openalex:W2075135612", "openalex:W2078687760", "openalex:W2082080293", "openalex:W2085662927", "openalex:W2086452472", "openalex:W2087175814", "openalex:W2092433382", "openalex:W2096016260", "openalex:W2096184964", "openalex:W2097982135", "openalex:W2098633248", "openalex:W2104148938", "openalex:W2113665653", "openalex:W2118849533", "openalex:W2120815846", "openalex:W2121860971", "openalex:W2124512625", "openalex:W2126311339", "openalex:W2131517816", "openalex:W2132205529", "openalex:W2133195474", "openalex:W2136837756", "openalex:W2138900265", "openalex:W2140414778", "openalex:W2143270986", "openalex:W2147558499", "openalex:W2148764920", "openalex:W2151422217", "openalex:W2155648416", "openalex:W2169102615", "openalex:W2203267307", "openalex:W2252040183", "openalex:W2295176576", "openalex:W2311914956", "openalex:W2335555489", "openalex:W2345489637", "openalex:W2414050368", "openalex:W2419461529", "openalex:W2505007294", "openalex:W2525194628", "openalex:W2563742216", "openalex:W2582439684", "openalex:W2594504931", "openalex:W2602737239", "openalex:W2614687836", "openalex:W2623066203", "openalex:W2738465457", "openalex:W2766755334", "openalex:W2769314405", "openalex:W2769583531", "openalex:W2774293052", "openalex:W2783187977", "openalex:W2790647914", "openalex:W2790726298", "openalex:W2791492851", "openalex:W2803248524", "openalex:W2805021533", "openalex:W2809629771", "openalex:W2890480785", "openalex:W2892659249", "openalex:W2903359542", "openalex:W2917779886", "openalex:W2924587039", "openalex:W2925195493", "openalex:W2943862792", "openalex:W2948418501", "openalex:W2948504964", "openalex:W2948924886", "openalex:W2949689970", "openalex:W2953016744", "openalex:W2982776635", "openalex:W2984749190", "openalex:W2986241899", "openalex:W2986309716", "openalex:W2994883889", "openalex:W3007529783", "openalex:W3009036462", "openalex:W3010943324", "openalex:W3011941014", "openalex:W3015814072", "openalex:W3029310104", "openalex:W3039111765", "openalex:W3081879130", "openalex:W3089678295", "openalex:W3120536054", "openalex:W3138691141", "openalex:W3174759122", "openalex:W3181776419", "openalex:W3184072428", "openalex:W3194036877", "openalex:W3195078123", "openalex:W3199814983", "openalex:W3205183711", "openalex:W3212568996", "openalex:W4200105095", "openalex:W4206221170", "openalex:W4221016003", "openalex:W4225783337", "openalex:W4226059181", "openalex:W4286491822", "openalex:W4292262238", "openalex:W4293659516", "openalex:W4295135118", "openalex:W4313889942"], "publication_date": null}

Affine transformations and\\nnonlinear activation functions, two key elements in neural networks, are\\nenacted in the quantum network using Gaussian and non-Gaussian gates,\\nrespectively. The non-Gaussian gates provide both the nonlinearity and the\\nuniversality of the model. Due to the structure of the CV model, the CV quantum\\nneural network can encode highly nonlinear transformations while remaining\\ncompletely unitary. We show how a classical network can be embedded into the\\nquantum formalism and propose quantum versions of various specialized model\\nsuch as convolutional, recurrent, and residual networks. Finally, we present\\nnumerous modeling experiments built with the Strawberry Fields software\\nlibrary.

{"title": "Earth system resilience through planetary active inference.", "abstract": "&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;We formalize the resilience of the Earth system under the free energy principle (Friston 2013; Parr et al, 2019; Rubin et al, 2020). This allows us to understand resilience as the self-maintenance of a non-equilibrium steady-state. This autopoietic steady-state depends on gradient flows that counter entropic dissipation by random fluctuations. These flows can also be interpreted in a statistical sense, which amounts to the claim that resilience depends upon the Earth system possessing a Markov blanket were blanket states (i.e., active and sensory states) separate internal states from external states. Our formalization rests on how the metabolic rates of the biosphere (i.e., internal states) relate vicariously to solar radiation at the Earth&amp;amp;#8217;s surface (i.e., external states), through the changes in greenhouse and albedo effects (i.e. active states) and ocean-driven global temperature changes (i.e. sensory states). Describing the interaction between the metabolic rates and solar radiation as climatic states&amp;amp;#8212;via a Markov blanket&amp;amp;#8212;amounts to describing the dynamics of the internal states as actively inferring external states.

{"title": "Evaluating the neurophysiological evidence for predictive processing as a model of perception", "abstract": "Abstract For many years, the dominant theoretical framework guiding research into the neural origins of perceptual experience has been provided by hierarchical feedforward models, in which sensory inputs are passed through a series of increasingly complex feature detectors. However, the long‐standing orthodoxy of these accounts has recently been challenged by a radically different set of theories that contend that perception arises from a purely inferential process supported by two distinct classes of neurons: those that transmit predictions about sensory states and those that signal sensory information that deviates from those predictions. Although these predictive processing (PP) models have become increasingly influential in cognitive neuroscience, they are also criticized for lacking the empirical support to justify their status. This limited evidence base partly reflects the considerable methodological challenges that are presented when trying to test the unique predictions of these models. However, a confluence of technological and theoretical advances has prompted a recent surge in human and nonhuman neurophysiological research seeking to fill this empirical gap. Here, we will review this new research and evaluate the degree to which its findings support the key claims of PP.", "authors": [{"name": "Kevin Walsh", "affiliation": "Trinity College Dublin", "orcid": "0000-0002-3745-2073"}, {"name": "David P.

{"title": "Exploring Cognition through Morphological Info-Computational Framework", "abstract": "Traditionally, cognition has been considered a uniquely human capability involving perception, memory, learning, reasoning, and problem-solving. However, recent research shows that cognition is a fundamental ability shared by all living beings, from single cells to complex organisms. This chapter takes an info-computational approach (ICON), viewing natural structures as information and the processes of change in these structures as computations. It is a relational framework dependent on the perspective of a cognizing observer/cognizer. Informational structures are properties of the material substrate, and when focusing on the behavior of the substrate, we discuss morphological computing (MC). ICON and MC are complementary perspectives for a cognizer. Information and computation are inseparably connected with cognition. This chapter explores research connecting nature as a computational structure for a cognizer, with morphological computation, morphogenesis, agency, extended cognition, and extended evolutionary synthesis, using examples of the free energy principle and active inference. It introduces theoretical and practical approaches challenging traditional computational models of cognition limited to abstract symbol processing, highlighting the computational capacities inherent in the material substrate (embodiment). Understanding the embodiment of cognition through its morphological computational basis is crucial for biology, evolution, intelligence theory, AI, robotics, and other fields.", "authors": [{"name": "Gordana Dodig-Crnković", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0001-9881-400X"}], "year": 2024, "doi": "10.48550/arxiv.2412.00748", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W4405033534", "venue": "arXiv (Cornell University)", "citation_count": 1, "references": [], "publication_date": null}

{"title": "On Distributed Computing Continuum Systems", "abstract": "This article presents our vision on the need of developing new managing technologies to harness distributed computing continuum systems. These systems are concurrently executed in multiple computing tiers: Cloud, Fog, Edge and IoT. This simple idea develops manifold challenges due to the inherent complexity inherited from the underlying infrastructures of these systems. This makes inappropriate the use of current methodologies for managing Internet distributed systems, which are based on the early systems that were based on client/server architectures and were completely specified by the application software. We present a new methodology to manage distributed computing continuum systems. This is based on a mathematical artifact called Markov Blanket, which sets these systems in a Markovian space, more suitable to cope with their complex characteristics. Furthermore, we develop the concept of equilibrium for these systems, providing a more flexible management framework compared with the one based on thresholds, currently in use for Internet-based distributed systems. Finally, we also link the equilibrium with the development of adaptive mechanisms. However, we are aware that developing the entire methodology requires a big effort and the use of learning techniques, therefore, we finish this article with an overview of the techniques required to develop this methodology.", "authors": [{"name": "Schahram Dustdar", "affiliation": "TU Wien", "orcid": "0000-0001-6872-8821"}, {"name": "Víctor Casamayor Pujol", "affiliation": "TU Wien", "orcid": "0000-0003-2830-8368"}, {"name": "Praveen Kumar Donta", "affiliation": "TU Wien", "orcid": "0000-0002-8233-6071"}], "year": 2022, "doi": "10.1109/tkde.2022.3142856", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W4206114022", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering", "citation_count": 128, "references": ["openalex:W1526097585", "openalex:W1556316174", "openalex:W1981696983", "openalex:W2030646934", "openalex:W2036594939", "openalex:W2147008239", "openalex:W2159080219", "openalex:W2159985326", "openalex:W2165190832", "openalex:W2201646840", "openalex:W2263756804", "openalex:W2321792379", "openalex:W2324228145", "openalex:W2393319904", "openalex:W2485657344", "openalex:W2510548579", "openalex:W2525748243", "openalex:W2538337023", "openalex:W2558460151", "openalex:W2573763768", "openalex:W2617660370", "openalex:W2736668803", "openalex:W2783657280", "openalex:W2808255162", "openalex:W2896915209", "openalex:W2911259477", "openalex:W2912826796", "openalex:W2914999862", "openalex:W2916584677", "openalex:W2917048035", "openalex:W2926752081", "openalex:W2938135176", "openalex:W2947197489", "openalex:W2965190706", "openalex:W2969513208", "openalex:W2969935099", "openalex:W2970357581", "openalex:W2979638007", "openalex:W2980507899", "openalex:W2998122921", "openalex:W3003886363", "openalex:W3006501067", "openalex:W3014714271", "openalex:W3026139144", "openalex:W3033535666", "openalex:W3038781879", "openalex:W3044723004", "openalex:W3097472721", "openalex:W3111967092", "openalex:W3118769118", "openalex:W3120419251", "openalex:W3125961706", "openalex:W3129131414", "openalex:W3131899022", "openalex:W3133993636", "openalex:W3135608507", "openalex:W3136370452", "openalex:W3152893301", "openalex:W3153000374", "openalex:W3158207578", "openalex:W3172927853", "openalex:W3175322838", "openalex:W3185062523", "openalex:W3201267215", "openalex:W3211358851", "openalex:W3213233044", "openalex:W3213717658", "openalex:W4226047880", "openalex:W4394648279", "openalex:W6631330034", "openalex:W6674856645", "openalex:W6675566125", "openalex:W6758491607", "openalex:W6790607510", "openalex:W6797086680", "openalex:W6797592442", "openalex:W6798865750"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Free Energy, Value, and Attractors", "abstract": "It has been suggested recently that action and perception can be understood as minimising the free energy of sensory samples. This ensures that agents sample the environment to maximise the evidence for their model of the world, such that exchanges with the environment are predictable and adaptive. However, the free energy account does not invoke reward or cost-functions from reinforcement-learning and optimal control theory. We therefore ask whether reward is necessary to explain adaptive behaviour. The free energy formulation uses ideas from statistical physics to explain action in terms of minimising sensory surprise. Conversely, reinforcement-learning has its roots in behaviourism and engineering and assumes that agents optimise a policy to maximise future reward. This paper tries to connect the two formulations and concludes that optimal policies correspond to empirical priors on the trajectories of hidden environmental states, which compel agents to seek out the (valuable) states they expect to encounter.", "authors": [{"name": "Karl Friston", "affiliation": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging", "orcid": "0000-0001-7984-8909"}, {"name": "Ping Ao", "affiliation": "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "orcid": "0000-0001-7109-628X"}], "year": 2011, "doi": "10.1155/2012/937860", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W1971715144", "venue": "Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine", "citation_count": 139, "references": ["openalex:W32403112", "openalex:W160989634", "openalex:W429051271", "openalex:W593934247", "openalex:W1483086805", "openalex:W1504499192", "openalex:W1515138319", "openalex:W1561704653", "openalex:W1568229137", "openalex:W1578630563", "openalex:W1582771551", "openalex:W1593884796", "openalex:W1601036473", "openalex:W1606584452", "openalex:W1871708413", "openalex:W1944446569", "openalex:W1965555277", "openalex:W1966656445", "openalex:W1968203843", "openalex:W1971758547", "openalex:W1973219195", "openalex:W1974055000", "openalex:W1977576450", "openalex:W1977628053", "openalex:W1978282545", "openalex:W1981443979", "openalex:W1985706433", "openalex:W1985983039", "openalex:W1988819089", "openalex:W1991362484", "openalex:W1994616650", "openalex:W1998948338", "openalex:W2003501808", "openalex:W2003900693", "openalex:W2004978206", "openalex:W2005866069", "openalex:W2006062868", "openalex:W2013266622", "openalex:W2022238029", "openalex:W2026799324", "openalex:W2037917209", "openalex:W2040598998", "openalex:W2044386301", "openalex:W2045347463", "openalex:W2047229728", "openalex:W2048648663", "openalex:W2056066754", "openalex:W2056653303", "openalex:W2061097716", "openalex:W2067050450", "openalex:W2070430318", "openalex:W2073696559", "openalex:W2073955207", "openalex:W2083070231", "openalex:W2092740013", "openalex:W2105009406", "openalex:W2113748017", "openalex:W2115979064", "openalex:W2117277172", "openalex:W2117359342", "openalex:W2117726420", "openalex:W2119333483", "openalex:W2119885245", "openalex:W2122249653", "openalex:W2125663122", "openalex:W2127531110", "openalex:W2127958135", "openalex:W2129541348", "openalex:W2130195834", "openalex:W2132003317", "openalex:W2134243390", "openalex:W2135100787", "openalex:W2137411342", "openalex:W2137547003", "openalex:W2137571295", "openalex:W2140173765", "openalex:W2145060720", "openalex:W2145805610", "openalex:W2147008239", "openalex:W2152081677", "openalex:W2152742892", "openalex:W2152909569", "openalex:W2153960487", "openalex:W2158065370", "openalex:W2160754686", "openalex:W2162657038", "openalex:W2166811440", "openalex:W2168016523", "openalex:W2264897026", "openalex:W2282054059", "openalex:W2317030384", "openalex:W2321141082", "openalex:W2329889558", "openalex:W2411171543", "openalex:W2487919169", "openalex:W3004847442", "openalex:W3022780580", "openalex:W3105907531", "openalex:W3121698465", "openalex:W3125716315", "openalex:W3135630760", "openalex:W3139377883", "openalex:W4249210107"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Unifying Theories of Psychedelic Drug Effects", "abstract": "How do psychedelic drugs produce their characteristic range of acute effects in perception, emotion, cognition, and sense of self? How do these effects relate to the clinical efficacy of psychedelic-assisted therapies? Efforts to understand psychedelic phenomena date back more than a century in Western science. In this article I review theories of psychedelic drug effects and highlight key concepts which have endured over the last 125 years of psychedelic science. First, I describe the subjective phenomenology of acute psychedelic effects using the best available data. Next, I review late 19th-century and early 20th-century theories-<i>model psychoses theory, filtration theory</i>, and <i>psychoanalytic theory</i>-and highlight their shared features. I then briefly review recent findings on the neuropharmacology and neurophysiology of psychedelic drugs in humans. Finally, I describe recent theories of psychedelic drug effects which leverage 21st-century cognitive neuroscience frameworks-<i>entropic brain theory, integrated information theory</i>, and <i>predictive processing</i>-and point out key shared features that link back to earlier theories. I identify an abstract principle which cuts across many theories past and present: psychedelic drugs perturb universal brain processes that normally serve to constrain neural systems central to perception, emotion, cognition, and sense of self. I conclude that making an explicit effort to investigate the principles and mechanisms of psychedelic drug effects is a uniquely powerful way to iteratively develop and test unifying theories of brain

{"title": "Predictive Processing and the Representation Wars", "abstract": "Clark has recently suggested that predictive processing advances a theory of neural function with the resources to put an ecumenical end to the \"representation wars\" of recent cognitive science. In this paper I defend and develop this suggestion. First, I broaden the representation wars to include three foundational challenges to representational cognitive science. Second, I articulate three features of predictive processing's account of internal representation that distinguish it from more orthodox representationalist frameworks. Specifically, I argue that it posits a resemblance-based representational architecture with organism-relative contents that functions in the service of pragmatic success, not veridical representation. Finally, I argue that internal representation so understood is either impervious to the three anti-representationalist challenges I outline or can actively embrace them.", "authors": [{"name": "Daniel R.

{"title": "Why empathy has a beneficial impact on others in medicine: unifying theories", "abstract": "The past decades have seen an explosion of studies on empathy in various academic domains including affective neuroscience, psychology, medicine, and economics. However, the volumes of research have almost exclusively focused on its evolutionary origins, development, and neurobiological bases, as well as how the experience of empathy is modulated by social context and interpersonal relationships. In the present paper, we examine a much less attended side of empathy: why it has a positive impact on others? After specifying what the construct of empathy encompasses, we brieﬂy review the various effects of empathy on health outcomes in the domain of medicine. We then propose two non-mutually exclusive mechanistic explanations that contribute to explain the positive effects of physician empathy on patients. (1) The social baseline theory (SBT), building on social support research, proposes that the presence of other people helps individuals to conserve metabolically costly somatic and neural resources through the social regulation of emotion.

{"title": "Where There is Life There is Mind: In Support of a Strong Life-Mind Continuity Thesis", "abstract": "This paper considers questions about continuity and discontinuity between life and mind. It begins by examining such questions from the perspective of the free energy principle (FEP). The FEP is becoming increasingly influential in neuroscience and cognitive science. It says that organisms act to maintain themselves in their expected biological and cognitive states, and that they can do so only by minimizing their free energy given that the long-term average of free energy is entropy. The paper then argues that there is no singular interpretation of the FEP for thinking about the relation between life and mind. Some FEP formulations express what we call an independence view of life and mind. One independence view is a cognitivist view of the FEP. It turns on information processing with semantic content, thus restricting the range of systems capable of exhibiting mentality. Other independence views exemplify what we call an overly generous non-cognitivist view of the FEP, and these appear to go in the opposite direction. That is, they imply that mentality is nearly everywhere. The paper proceeds to argue that non-cognitivist FEP, and its implications for thinking about the relation between life and mind, can be usefully constrained by key ideas in recent enactive approaches to cognitive science. We conclude that the most compelling account of the relationship between life and mind treats them as strongly continuous, and that this continuity is based on particular concepts of life (autopoiesis and adaptivity) and mind (basic and non-semantic).", "authors": [{"name": "Michael D.

{"title": "In the Body’s Eye: The computational anatomy of interoceptive inference", "abstract": "A growing body of evidence highlights the intricate linkage of exteroceptive perception to the rhythmic activity of the visceral body. In parallel, interoceptive inference theories of affective perception and self-consciousness are on the rise in cognitive science. However, thus far no formal theory has emerged to integrate these twin domains; instead, most extant work is conceptual in nature. Here, we introduce a formal model of cardiac active inference, which explains how ascending cardiac signals entrain exteroceptive sensory perception and uncertainty. Through simulated psychophysics, we reproduce the defensive startle reflex and commonly reported effects linking the cardiac cycle to affective behaviour. We further show that simulated ‘interoceptive lesions’ blunt affective expectations, induce psychosomatic hallucinations, and exacerbate biases in perceptual uncertainty. Through synthetic heart-rate variability analyses, we illustrate how the balance of arousal-priors and visceral prediction errors produces idiosyncratic patterns of physiological reactivity. Our model thus offers a roadmap for computationally phenotyping disordered brain-body interaction.", "authors": [{"name": "Micah Allen", "affiliation": "Aarhus University Hospital", "orcid": "0000-0001-9399-4179"}, {"name": "Andrew R.

{"title": "Uncertainty minimization and pattern recognition in <i>Volvox carteri</i> and <i>V. aureus</i>", "abstract": "The field of diverse intelligence explores the capacity of systems without complex brains to dynamically engage with changing environments, seeking fundamental principles of cognition and their evolutionary origins. However, there are many knowledge gaps around a general behavioural directive connecting aneural to neural organisms. This study tests predictions of the computational framework of active inference based on the free energy principle in neuroscience, applied to aneural biological processes. We demonstrate pattern recognition in the green algae Volvox using phototactic experiments with varied light pulse patterns, measuring their phototactic bias as a readout for their preferential ability to detect and adapt to one pattern over another. Results show Volvox adapt more readily to regular patterns than irregular ones and even exhibit memory properties, exhibiting a crucial component of basal intelligence. Pharmacological and electric shock-based interventions and photoadaptation simulations reveal how randomized stimuli interfere with normal photoadaptation through a structured dynamic interplay of colony rotation and calcium-mediated photoreceptor-to-flagellar information transfer, consistent with uncertainty minimization. The detection of functional uncertainty minimization in an aneural organism expands concepts like uncertainty minimization beyond neurons and provides insights and novel intervention tools applicable to other living systems, similar to early learning validations in simpler neural organisms.", "authors": [{"name": "Franz Kuchling", "affiliation": "Tufts University", "orcid": "0000-0003-2339-1991"}, {"name": "Isha Singh", "affiliation": "Tufts University", "orcid": null}, {"name": "Mridushi Daga", "affiliation": "Tufts University", "orcid": null}, {"name": "Susan Zec", "affiliation": "Tufts University", "orcid": null}, {"name": "Alexandra Kunen", "affiliation": "Tufts University", "orcid": null}, {"name": "Michael Levin", "affiliation": "Tufts University", "orcid": "0000-0001-7292-8084"}], "year": 2025, "doi": "10.1098/rsif.2024.0645", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W4407929430", "venue": "Journal of The Royal Society Interface", "citation_count": 1, "references": ["openalex:W1505523925", "openalex:W1507102473", "openalex:W1978383578", "openalex:W1979848013", "openalex:W1997451298", "openalex:W2022405619", "openalex:W2024130051", "openalex:W2029056405", "openalex:W2047409756", "openalex:W2050839379", "openalex:W2051606585", "openalex:W2054128638", "openalex:W2055789905", "openalex:W2074663723", "openalex:W2074876028", "openalex:W2076169321", "openalex:W2079650925", "openalex:W2082400913", "openalex:W2091847025", "openalex:W2122458046", "openalex:W2136602896", "openalex:W2139384331", "openalex:W2153685804", "openalex:W2154123408", "openalex:W2154191107", "openalex:W2155040131", "openalex:W2155534824", "openalex:W2155744172", "openalex:W2161704424", "openalex:W2163430198", "openalex:W2175307482", "openalex:W2314770590", "openalex:W2329354315", "openalex:W2407000226", "openalex:W2410837675", "openalex:W2444466369", "openalex:W2461939826", "openalex:W2569076969", "openalex:W2589653196", "openalex:W2745326990", "openalex:W2783657280", "openalex:W2810873133", "openalex:W2950915616", "openalex:W2951666363", "openalex:W2993206637", "openalex:W2999900178", "openalex:W3006924944", "openalex:W3079890010", "openalex:W3092030771", "openalex:W3103782180", "openalex:W3123874034", "openalex:W3127122147", "openalex:W3127203216", "openalex:W3127479309", "openalex:W3177934866", "openalex:W3197031970", "openalex:W4200300030", "openalex:W4214859751", "openalex:W4220845414", "openalex:W4224442515", "openalex:W4229037531", "openalex:W4246233237", "openalex:W4283014711", "openalex:W4293109481", "openalex:W4308094659", "openalex:W4313244913", "openalex:W4317436299", "openalex:W4317543154", "openalex:W4317666200", "openalex:W4362475206", "openalex:W4384938107", "openalex:W4402295364"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Value Cores for Inner and Outer Alignment: Simulating Personality Formation via Iterated Policy Selection and Preference Learning with Self-World Modeling Active Inference Agents", "abstract": "Humanity faces multiple existential risks in the coming decades due to technological advances in AI, and the possibility of unintended behaviors emerging from such systems. We believe that better outcomes may be possible by rigorously exploring frameworks for intelligent (goal-oriented) behavior inspired by computational neuroscience. Here, we explore how the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference (FEP-AI) framework may provide solutions for these challenges via affording the realization of control systems operating according to principles of hierarchical Bayesian modeling and prediction-error (i.e., surprisal) minimization. Such FEP-AI agents are equipped with hierarchically-organized world models capable of counterfactual planning, realized by the kinds of reciprocal message passing performed by mammalian nervous systems, so allowing for the flexible construction of representations of self-world dynamics with varying degrees of temporal depth. We will describe how such systems can not only infer the abstract causal structure of their environment, but also develop capacities for “theory of mind” and collaborative (human-aligned) decision making. Such architectures could help to sidestep potentially dangerous combinations of systems with high intelligence and human-incompatible values, since such mental processes are entangled (rather than orthogonal) in FEP-AI agents. We will further describe how (meta-)learned deep goal hierarchies may also well-describe biological systems, suggesting that potential risks from “mesa-optimisers” may actually represent one of the most promising approaches to AI safety: minimizing prediction-error relative to causal self-world models can be used to cultivate modes of policy selection and agent personalities that robustly optimize for achieving goals that are consistently aligned with both individual and shared values. Finally, we will describe how iterative policy selection and preference learning can result in \"value cores\" or self-reinforcing, relatively stable attracting states that agents will seek to return to through their goal-oriented imaginings and actions.", "authors": [{"name": "Adam Safron", "affiliation": "Johns Hopkins University", "orcid": "0000-0002-3102-7623"}, {"name": "Zahra Sheikhbahaee", "affiliation": "University of Waterloo", "orcid": null}, {"name": "N.

{"title": "Embodied and Enactive Approaches to Cognition", "abstract": "This Element discusses contemporary theories of embodied cognition, including what has been termed the '4Es' (embodied, embedded, extended and enactive cognition). It examines diverse approaches to questions about the nature of the mind, the mind's relation to the brain, perceptual experience, mental representation, sense making, the role of the environment, and social cognition, and it considers the strengths and weaknesses of the theories in question. It contrasts embodied and enactive views with classic cognitivism, and discusses major criticisms and their possible resolutions. This element also provides a strong focus on enactive theory and the prospects for integrating enactive approaches with other embodied and extended theories, mediated through recent developments in predictive processing and the free energy principle. It concludes with a brief discussion of the practical applications of embodied cognition.

{"title": "Generalised Filtering", "abstract": "We describe a Bayesian filtering scheme for nonlinear state‐space models in continuous time. This scheme is called Generalised Filtering and furnishes posterior (conditional) densities on hidden states and unknown parameters generating observed data. Crucially, the scheme operates online, assimilating data to optimize the conditional density on time‐varying states and time‐invariant parameters. In contrast to Kalman and Particle smoothing, Generalised Filtering does not require a backwards pass. In contrast to variational schemes, it does not assume conditional independence between the states and parameters. Generalised Filtering optimises the conditional density with respect to a free‐energy bound on the model′s log‐evidence.

{"title": "Dopamine, reward learning, and active inference", "abstract": "Temporal difference learning models propose phasic dopamine signaling encodes reward prediction errors that drive learning. This is supported by studies where optogenetic stimulation of dopamine neurons can stand in lieu of actual reward. Nevertheless, a large body of data also shows that dopamine is not necessary for learning, and that dopamine depletion primarily affects task performance. We offer a resolution to this paradox based on an hypothesis that dopamine encodes the precision of beliefs about alternative actions, and thus controls the outcome-sensitivity of behavior. We extend an active inference scheme for solving Markov decision processes to include learning, and show that simulated dopamine dynamics strongly resemble those actually observed during instrumental conditioning. Furthermore, simulated dopamine depletion impairs performance but spares learning, while simulated excitation of dopamine neurons drives reward learning, through aberrant inference about outcome states. Our formal approach provides a novel and parsimonious reconciliation of apparently divergent experimental findings.", "authors": [{"name": "Thomas H. B.

{"title": "Cognitive Dynamics: From Attractors to Active Inference", "abstract": "This paper combines recent formulations of self-organization and neuronal processing to provide an account of cognitive dynamics from basic principles. We start by showing that inference (and autopoiesis) are emergent features of any (weakly mixing) ergodic random dynamical system. We then apply the emergent dynamics to action and perception in a way that casts action as the fulfillment of (Bayesian) beliefs about the causes of sensations. More formally, we formulate ergodic flows on global random attractors as a generalized descent on a free energy functional of the internal states of a system. This formulation rests on a partition of states based on a Markov blanket that separates internal states from hidden states in the external milieu. This separation means that the internal states effectively represent external states probabilistically. The generalized descent is then related to classical Bayesian (e.g., Kalman-Bucy) filtering and predictive coding-of the sort that might be implemented in the brain. Finally, we present two simulations. The first simulates a primordial soup to illustrate the emergence of a Markov blanket and (active) inference about hidden states. The second uses the same emergent dynamics to simulate action and action observation.", "authors": [{"name": "Karl Friston", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0001-7984-8909"}, {"name": "Biswa Sengupta", "affiliation": null, "orcid": "0000-0002-1377-6583"}, {"name": "Gennaro Auletta", "affiliation": "Pontifical Gregorian University", "orcid": "0000-0001-6135-9779"}], "year": 2014, "doi": "10.1109/jproc.2014.2306251", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W2153418039", "venue": "Proceedings of the IEEE", "citation_count": 98, "references": ["openalex:W41144880", "openalex:W81409850", "openalex:W563131707", "openalex:W1504499192", "openalex:W1528946842", "openalex:W1556913189", "openalex:W1582771551", "openalex:W1584724822", "openalex:W1593884796", "openalex:W1601036473", "openalex:W1944446569", "openalex:W1965555277", "openalex:W1971123690", "openalex:W1971283401", "openalex:W1971715144", "openalex:W1973219195", "openalex:W1973243121", "openalex:W1977628053", "openalex:W1980230793", "openalex:W1980661496", "openalex:W1981737644", "openalex:W1983249679", "openalex:W1983941091", "openalex:W1988819089", "openalex:W1991362484", "openalex:W1991742640", "openalex:W1994892978", "openalex:W1994969696", "openalex:W1998948338", "openalex:W2000867087", "openalex:W2003900693", "openalex:W2026799324", "openalex:W2032558547", "openalex:W2033422410", "openalex:W2040891197", "openalex:W2044386301", "openalex:W2047229728", "openalex:W2048648663", "openalex:W2053423120", "openalex:W2055789905", "openalex:W2061097716", "openalex:W2065264265", "openalex:W2067505402", "openalex:W2070430318", "openalex:W2070813962", "openalex:W2073955207", "openalex:W2076214212", "openalex:W2093879971", "openalex:W2096375888", "openalex:W2096962395", "openalex:W2111947800", "openalex:W2112129677", "openalex:W2113257799", "openalex:W2115979064", "openalex:W2120079537", "openalex:W2122249653", "openalex:W2125663122", "openalex:W2127531110", "openalex:W2128065872", "openalex:W2128666650", "openalex:W2128957129", "openalex:W2130195834", "openalex:W2130453501", "openalex:W2137411342", "openalex:W2139475683", "openalex:W2147008239", "openalex:W2148764920", "openalex:W2150066954", "openalex:W2151496011", "openalex:W2152742892", "openalex:W2152909569", "openalex:W2154123408", "openalex:W2158065370", "openalex:W2159080219", "openalex:W2166811440", "openalex:W2168016523", "openalex:W2172463260", "openalex:W2239029832", "openalex:W2317030384", "openalex:W2493894436", "openalex:W2558972134", "openalex:W3022532439", "openalex:W3121698465", "openalex:W4213322300", "openalex:W4213348475", "openalex:W4237718205", "openalex:W4243509751", "openalex:W4249210107", "openalex:W4251227784", "openalex:W6662449848"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Deficits in Predictive Coding Underlie Hallucinations in Schizophrenia", "abstract": "The neural mechanisms that produce hallucinations and other psychotic symptoms remain unclear. Previous research suggests that deficits in predictive signals for learning, such as prediction error signals, may underlie psychotic symptoms, but the mechanism by which such deficits produce psychotic symptoms remains to be established. We used model-based fMRI to study sensory prediction errors in human patients with schizophrenia who report daily auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs) and sociodemographically matched healthy control subjects. We manipulated participants' expectations for hearing speech at different periods within a speech decision-making task. Patients activated a voice-sensitive region of the auditory cortex while they experienced AVHs in the scanner and displayed a concomitant deficit in prediction error signals in a similar portion of auditory cortex. This prediction error deficit correlated strongly with increased activity during silence and with reduced volumes of the auditory cortex, two established neural phenotypes of AVHs. Furthermore, patients with more severe AVHs had more deficient prediction error signals and greater activity during silence within the region of auditory cortex where groups differed, regardless of the severity of psychotic symptoms other than AVHs. Our findings suggest that deficient predictive coding accounts for the resting hyperactivity in sensory cortex that leads to hallucinations.", "authors": [{"name": "Guillermo Horga", "affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center", "orcid": "0000-0002-9049-9786"}, {"name": "Kelcie C.

{"title": "Recognizing Sequences of Sequences", "abstract": "The brain's decoding of fast sensory streams is currently impossible to emulate, even approximately, with artificial agents. For example, robust speech recognition is relatively easy for humans but exceptionally difficult for artificial speech recognition systems. In this paper, we propose that recognition can be simplified with an internal model of how sensory input is generated, when formulated in a Bayesian framework. We show that a plausible candidate for an internal or generative model is a hierarchy of 'stable heteroclinic channels'. This model describes continuous dynamics in the environment as a hierarchy of sequences, where slower sequences cause faster sequences. Under this model, online recognition corresponds to the dynamic decoding of causal sequences, giving a representation of the environment with predictive power on several timescales. We illustrate the ensuing decoding or recognition scheme using synthetic sequences of syllables, where syllables are sequences of phonemes and phonemes are sequences of sound-wave modulations. By presenting anomalous stimuli, we find that the resulting recognition dynamics disclose inference at multiple time scales and are reminiscent of neuronal dynamics seen in the real brain.", "authors": [{"name": "Stefan J.

{"title": "Unraveling Negative Expectations and Nocebo-Related Effects in Musculoskeletal Pain", "abstract": "This Perspective adapts the ViolEx Model, a framework validated in several clinical conditions, to better understand the role of expectations in the recovery and/or maintenance of musculoskeletal (MSK) pain. Here, particular attention is given to the condition in which dysfunctional expectations are maintained despite no longer being supported by confirmatory evidence (i.e., belief—lifting the arm leads to permanent tendon damage; evidence—after the patient lifts the arm no tendon damage occurs). While the ViolEx Model suggests that cognitive immunization strategies are responsible for the maintenance of dysfunctional expectations, we suggest that such phenomenon can also be understood from a Bayesian Brain perspective, according to which the level of precision of the priors (i.e., expectations) is the determinant factor accounting for the extent of priors’ updating (i.e., we merge the two frameworks, suggesting that highly precise prior can lead to cognitive immunization responses). Importantly, this Perspective translates the theory behind these two frameworks into clinical suggestions. Precisely, it is argued that different strategies should be implemented when treating MSK pain patients, depending on the nature of their expectations (i.e., positive or negative and the level of their precision).", "authors": [{"name": "Giacomo Rossettini", "affiliation": "University of Verona", "orcid": "0000-0002-1623-7681"}, {"name": "Andrea Colombi", "affiliation": "University of Genoa", "orcid": "0000-0002-7604-5243"}, {"name": "Elisa Carlino", "affiliation": "University of Turin", "orcid": "0000-0001-8472-656X"}, {"name": "Mattia Manoni", "affiliation": "University of Genoa", "orcid": null}, {"name": "Mattia Mirandola", "affiliation": "University of Verona", "orcid": "0000-0001-7145-3443"}, {"name": "Andrea Polli", "affiliation": "Pain in Motion", "orcid": "0000-0001-8559-2217"}, {"name": "Eleonora Maria Camerone", "affiliation": "University of Milano-Bicocca", "orcid": "0000-0002-4771-2836"}, {"name": "Marco Testa", "affiliation": "University of Genoa", "orcid": "0000-0001-8643-7200"}], "year": 2022, "doi": "10.3389/fpsyg.2022.789377", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W4221083536", "venue": "Frontiers in Psychology", "citation_count": 262, "references": ["openalex:W1508801287", "openalex:W1581470304", "openalex:W1963302241", "openalex:W1967034335", "openalex:W1971866798", "openalex:W1977628053", "openalex:W1978549608", "openalex:W1980336442", "openalex:W1987239968", "openalex:W1993895003", "openalex:W1994173799", "openalex:W2000576846", "openalex:W2006644301", "openalex:W2028057728", "openalex:W2039909349", "openalex:W2050383033", "openalex:W2063765409", "openalex:W2070972521", "openalex:W2077611172", "openalex:W2078603525", "openalex:W2094889816", "openalex:W2130936198", "openalex:W2148764920", "openalex:W2268248714", "openalex:W2286578846", "openalex:W2301817203", "openalex:W2472697878", "openalex:W2529149716", "openalex:W2550455161", "openalex:W2557951386", "openalex:W2562175052", "openalex:W2576683340", "openalex:W2589370417", "openalex:W2594000393", "openalex:W2597185941", "openalex:W2602188617", "openalex:W2609609529", "openalex:W2618739370", "openalex:W2761991297", "openalex:W2771019175", "openalex:W2773372620", "openalex:W2774836302", "openalex:W2785245623", "openalex:W2793221098", "openalex:W2795613832", "openalex:W2800968568", "openalex:W2802815620", "openalex:W2807131419", "openalex:W2811416231", "openalex:W2885815791", "openalex:W2887718708", "openalex:W2888004369", "openalex:W2893290031", "openalex:W2898257988", "openalex:W2899689461", "openalex:W2901716831", "openalex:W2902733917", "openalex:W2912865989", "openalex:W2919037986", "openalex:W2922191225", "openalex:W2932977929", "openalex:W2950272433", "openalex:W2950670678", "openalex:W2950863327", "openalex:W2951535430", "openalex:W2951900044", "openalex:W2952722631", "openalex:W2962729479", "openalex:W2964018328", "openalex:W2964042994", "openalex:W2979419959", "openalex:W2990971412", "openalex:W2991482612", "openalex:W2994829159", "openalex:W3003807996", "openalex:W3011255466", "openalex:W3015495278", "openalex:W3026897548", "openalex:W3031811911", "openalex:W3033082973", "openalex:W3034225839", "openalex:W3035355209", "openalex:W3037499080", "openalex:W3043073274", "openalex:W3045155733", "openalex:W3046840428", "openalex:W3048883151", "openalex:W3082311850", "openalex:W3094463858", "openalex:W3095104130", "openalex:W3096320319", "openalex:W3129040522", "openalex:W3131408723", "openalex:W3136524452", "openalex:W3137961027", "openalex:W3139492950", "openalex:W3154617349", "openalex:W3155774006", "openalex:W3160254650", "openalex:W3164981705", "openalex:W3170187947", "openalex:W3172742309", "openalex:W3176936014", "openalex:W3177026105", "openalex:W3177199282", "openalex:W3181767983", "openalex:W3190276398", "openalex:W3190743132", "openalex:W3192469675", "openalex:W3192785026", "openalex:W3193727278", "openalex:W3194827020", "openalex:W3198604177", "openalex:W3201046870", "openalex:W3209109380", "openalex:W3211537060", "openalex:W4206101680"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Representation Wars: Enacting an Armistice Through Active Inference", "abstract": "Over the last 30 years, representationalist and dynamicist positions in the philosophy of cognitive science have argued over whether neurocognitive processes should be viewed as representational or not. Major scientific and technological developments over the years have furnished both parties with ever more sophisticated conceptual weaponry. In recent years, an enactive generalization of predictive processing – known as active inference – has been proposed as a unifying theory of brain functions. Since then, active inference has fueled both representationalist and dynamicist campaigns. However, we believe that when diving into the formal details of active inference, one should be able to find a solution to the war; if not a peace treaty, surely an armistice of a sort. Based on an analysis of these formal details, this paper shows how both representationalist and dynamicist sensibilities can peacefully coexist within the new territory of active inference.", "authors": [{"name": "Axel Constant", "affiliation": "University of Sydney", "orcid": "0000-0002-1547-8803"}, {"name": "Andy Clark", "affiliation": "Macquarie University", "orcid": "0000-0002-1233-8629"}, {"name": "Karl Friston", "affiliation": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging", "orcid": "0000-0001-7984-8909"}], "year": 2021, "doi": "10.3389/fpsyg.2020.598733", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W2955223004", "venue": "Frontiers in Psychology", "citation_count": 92, "references": ["openalex:W393180982", "openalex:W1418557530", "openalex:W1524895715", "openalex:W1550989509", "openalex:W1729777349", "openalex:W1752839524", "openalex:W1966994034", "openalex:W1986402015", "openalex:W1991840022", "openalex:W1992766572", "openalex:W1993875113", "openalex:W2000514530", "openalex:W2002907081", "openalex:W2004978206", "openalex:W2012953331", "openalex:W2024149692", "openalex:W2026799324", "openalex:W2034806191", "openalex:W2039546655", "openalex:W2045051394", "openalex:W2052729098", "openalex:W2055789905", "openalex:W2059320470", "openalex:W2077901520", "openalex:W2085754318", "openalex:W2091552189", "openalex:W2093466600", "openalex:W2096962395", "openalex:W2115979064", "openalex:W2117663940", "openalex:W2118555141", "openalex:W2128569326", "openalex:W2142987319", "openalex:W2147008239", "openalex:W2148764920", "openalex:W2150013078", "openalex:W2153791616", "openalex:W2154409655", "openalex:W2154562678", "openalex:W2237059274", "openalex:W2327310820", "openalex:W2391599638", "openalex:W2424475825", "openalex:W2463330366", "openalex:W2479616914", "openalex:W2484983710", "openalex:W2534098824", "openalex:W2552810632", "openalex:W2564601941", "openalex:W2584391386", "openalex:W2605417277", "openalex:W2606488938", "openalex:W2617660370", "openalex:W2618517468", "openalex:W2619035405", "openalex:W2623066203", "openalex:W2728381624", "openalex:W2754844655", "openalex:W2765383588", "openalex:W2769704218", "openalex:W2769859915", "openalex:W2781668895", "openalex:W2783657280", "openalex:W2789196295", "openalex:W2791191427", "openalex:W2797051230", "openalex:W2802947734", "openalex:W2810408525", "openalex:W2883065040", "openalex:W2890724683", "openalex:W2898208057", "openalex:W2908555537", "openalex:W2918957485", "openalex:W2919115771", "openalex:W2933899145", "openalex:W2945218746", "openalex:W2947609478", "openalex:W2953421850", "openalex:W3001808890", "openalex:W3004320394", "openalex:W3012959192", "openalex:W3095485376", "openalex:W3108742966", "openalex:W4214574923", "openalex:W4214717370", "openalex:W4229972507", "openalex:W4231563569", "openalex:W4233232147", "openalex:W4234344480", "openalex:W4239649652", "openalex:W4239909465", "openalex:W4241953145", "openalex:W4241976975", "openalex:W4245880239", "openalex:W4247883378", "openalex:W4247939221"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Locus Coeruleus tracking of prediction errors optimises cognitive flexibility: An Active Inference model", "abstract": "The locus coeruleus (LC) in the pons is the major source of noradrenaline (NA) in the brain. Two modes of LC firing have been associated with distinct cognitive states: changes in tonic rates of firing are correlated with global levels of arousal and behavioural flexibility, whilst phasic LC responses are evoked by salient stimuli. Here, we unify these two modes of firing by modelling the response of the LC as a correlate of a prediction error when inferring states for action planning under Active Inference (AI). We simulate a classic Go/No-go reward learning task and a three-arm 'explore/exploit' task and show that, if LC activity is considered to reflect the magnitude of high level 'state-action' prediction errors, then both tonic and phasic modes of firing are emergent features of belief updating. We also demonstrate that when contingencies change, AI agents can update their internal models more quickly by feeding back this state-action prediction error-reflected in LC firing and noradrenaline release-to optimise learning rate, enabling large adjustments over short timescales. We propose that such prediction errors are mediated by cortico-LC connections, whilst ascending input from LC to cortex modulates belief updating in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). In short, we characterise the LC/ NA system within a general theory of brain function. In doing so, we show that contrasting, behaviour-dependent firing patterns are an emergent property of the LC that translates state-action prediction errors into an optimal balance between plasticity and stability.", "authors": [{"name": "Anna C.

Here, we introduce a formal model of cardiac active inference, which explains how ascending cardiac signals entrain exteroceptive sensory perception and confidence. Through simulated psychophysics, we reproduce the defensive startle reflex and commonly reported effects linking the cardiac cycle to fear perception. We further show that simulated ‘interoceptive lesions’ blunt fear expectations, induce psychosomatic hallucinations, and exacerbate metacognitive biases. Through synthetic heart-rate variability analyses, we illustrate how the balance of arousal-priors and visceral prediction errors produces idiosyncratic patterns of physiological reactivity. Our model thus offers the possibility to computationally phenotype disordered brain-body interaction.", "authors": [{"name": "Micah Allen", "affiliation": "Aarhus University", "orcid": "0000-0001-9399-4179"}, {"name": "Andrew R.

{"title": "Critical Risks and Opportunities of AI, Economics, Social Network Theory", "abstract": "As artificial intelligence systems increasingly participate in human communication, negotiation, and collaboration, they are becoming active agents within social networks. This talk explores the emerging social ecology of human–AI interactions, drawing on theory of mind (ToM), economic game theory, and social network dynamics to assess the systemic risks and benefits of AI integration. Using Cicero—the Diplomacy-playing AI—as a case study, we show how minimal ToM architectures already enable strategic, cooperative behavior indistinguishable from human interaction in multi-agent environments. We develop a framework that interprets these capabilities through the lens of the Free Energy Principle, treating decision-making as inference under uncertainty and interaction as belief-based coordination. However, we argue that scaling current models does not automatically yield deeper social understanding or safety. Instead, the emergent dynamics of human–AI social systems resemble complex adaptive networks, where individual agent behavior can amplify fragilities or promote robustness depending on institutional constraints and architectural design. The integration of AI agents into social contexts thus constitutes a critical juncture: one where the topology of influence, the nature of delegation, and the emergence of recursive misalignment can generate systemic risk—or unlock scalable prosocial coordination. We explore how modular cognitive architectures, combined with information-theoretic models of control, offer leverage points for shaping this future. The conclusion emphasizes the importance of designing for sensitive intervention points within these systems, echoing recent work in complexity science. AI does not act in isolation; its real-world impacts will be mediated by the structure and evolution of the social systems it enters.", "authors": [{"name": "Michael Harré", "affiliation": "University of Sydney", "orcid": "0000-0003-2199-2515"}], "year": 2025, "doi": "10.48550/arxiv.2507.13616", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W4416833778", "venue": "arXiv (Cornell University)", "citation_count": 1, "references": [], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "The evolution of brain architectures for predictive coding and active inference", "abstract": "Abstract This article considers the evolution of brain architectures for predictive processing. We argue that brain mechanisms for predictive perception and action are not late evolutionary additions of advanced creatures like us. Rather, they emerged gradually from simpler predictive loops (e.g. autonomic and motor reflexes) that were a legacy from our earlier evolutionary ancestors—and were key to solving their fundamental problems of adaptive regulation. We characterize simpler-to-more-complex brains formally, in terms of generative models that include predictive loops of increasing hierarchical breadth and depth. These may start from a simple homeostatic motif and be elaborated during evolution in four main ways: these include the multimodal expansion of predictive control into an allostatic loop; its duplication to form multiple sensorimotor loops that expand an animal's behavioural repertoire; and the gradual endowment of generative models with hierarchical depth (to deal with aspects of the world that unfold at different spatial scales) and temporal depth (to select plans in a future-oriented manner). In turn, these elaborations underwrite the solution to biological regulation problems faced by increasingly sophisticated animals. Our proposal aligns neuroscientific theorising—about predictive processing—with evolutionary and comparative data on brain architectures in different animal species.

{"title": "A new science of emotion: implications for functional neurological disorder", "abstract": "Abstract Functional neurological disorder reflects impairments in brain networks leading to distressing motor, sensory and/or cognitive symptoms that demonstrate positive clinical signs on examination incongruent with other conditions. A central issue in historical and contemporary formulations of functional neurological disorder has been the mechanistic and aetiological role of emotions. However, the debate has mostly omitted fundamental questions about the nature of emotions in the first place. In this perspective article, we first outline a set of relevant working principles of the brain (e.g. allostasis, predictive processing, interoception and affect), followed by a focused review of the theory of constructed emotion to introduce a new understanding of what emotions are. Building on this theoretical framework, we formulate how altered emotion category construction can be an integral component of the pathophysiology of functional neurological disorder and related functional somatic symptoms. In doing so, we address several themes for the functional neurological disorder field including: (i) how energy regulation and the process of emotion category construction relate to symptom generation, including revisiting alexithymia, ‘panic attack without panic’, dissociation, insecure attachment and the influential role of life experiences; (ii) re-interpret select neurobiological research findings in functional neurological disorder cohorts through the lens of the theory of constructed emotion to illustrate its potential mechanistic relevance; and (iii) discuss therapeutic implications. While we continue to support that functional neurological disorder is mechanistically and aetiologically heterogenous, consideration of how the theory of constructed emotion relates to the generation and maintenance of functional neurological and functional somatic symptoms offers an integrated viewpoint that cuts across neurology, psychiatry, psychology and cognitive-affective neuroscience.", "authors": [{"name": "Johannes Jungilligens", "affiliation": "Massachusetts General Hospital", "orcid": "0000-0002-4846-8337"}, {"name": "Sara Paredes-Echeverri", "affiliation": "Harvard University", "orcid": "0000-0001-5163-4730"}, {"name": "Stoyan Popkirov", "affiliation": "Ruhr University Bochum", "orcid": "0000-0001-6168-0036"}, {"name": "Lisa Feldman Barrett", "affiliation": "Northeastern University", "orcid": "0000-0003-4478-2051"}, {"name": "David L.

{"title": "“Surprise” and the Bayesian Brain: Implications for Psychotherapy Theory and Practice", "abstract": "The free energy principle (FEP) has gained widespread interest and growing acceptance as a new paradigm of brain function, but has had little impact on the theory and practice of psychotherapy. The aim of this paper is to redress this. Brains rely on Bayesian inference during which \"bottom-up\" sensations are matched with \"top-down\" predictions. Discrepancies result in \"prediction error.\" The brain abhors informational \"surprise,\" which is minimized by (1) action enhancing the statistical likelihood of sensory samples, (2) revising inferences in the light of experience, updating \"priors\" to reality-aligned \"posteriors,\" and (3) optimizing the complexity of our generative models of a capricious world. In all three, free energy is converted to bound energy. In psychopathology energy either remains unbound, as in trauma and inhibition of agency, or manifests restricted, anachronistic \"top-down\" narratives. Psychotherapy fosters client agency, linguistic and practical. Temporary uncoupling bottom-up from top-down automatism and fostering scrutinized simulations sets a number of salutary processes in train. <i>Mentalising</i> enriches Bayesian inference, enabling experience and feeling states to be \"metabolized\" and assimilated. \"Free association\" enhances more inclusive sensory sampling, while dream analysis foregrounds salient emotional themes as \"attractors.\" FEP parallels with psychoanalytic theory are outlined, including Freud's unpublished project, Bion's \"contact barrier\" concept, the Fonagy/Target model of sexuality, Laplanche's therapist as \"enigmatic signifier,\" and the role of projective identification. The therapy stimulates patients to become aware of and revise the priors' they bring to interpersonal experience. In the therapeutic \"duet for one,\" the energy binding skills and non-partisan stance of the analyst help sufferers face trauma without being overwhelmed by psychic entropy. Overall, the FEP provides a sound theoretical basis for psychotherapy practice, training, and research.", "authors": [{"name": "Jeremy Holmes", "affiliation": "Anna Freud Centre", "orcid": "0000-0002-7526-0240"}, {"name": "Tobias Nolte", "affiliation": "University of Exeter", "orcid": "0000-0002-6834-7727"}], "year": 2019, "doi": "10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00592", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W2931034662", "venue": "Frontiers in Psychology", "citation_count": 87, "references": ["openalex:W85618426", "openalex:W94149687", "openalex:W588196921", "openalex:W1480675308", "openalex:W1524895715", "openalex:W1528811942", "openalex:W1552043677", "openalex:W1556913189", "openalex:W1587819869", "openalex:W1676960210", "openalex:W1684369197", "openalex:W1728298943", "openalex:W1766812542", "openalex:W1818935397", "openalex:W1924288196", "openalex:W1946549469", "openalex:W1966709368", "openalex:W1975339117", "openalex:W2005695097", "openalex:W2008950282", "openalex:W2012176474", "openalex:W2015982946", "openalex:W2017794063", "openalex:W2024149692", "openalex:W2031042133", "openalex:W2055789905", "openalex:W2065187007", "openalex:W2072606141", "openalex:W2077901520", "openalex:W2080362357", "openalex:W2080654992", "openalex:W2081808862", "openalex:W2082149624", "openalex:W2082940887", "openalex:W2090616473", "openalex:W2091867346", "openalex:W2099505143", "openalex:W2103692957", "openalex:W2104967339", "openalex:W2107557962", "openalex:W2110421839", "openalex:W2113367546", "openalex:W2128666650", "openalex:W2132003317", "openalex:W2133566473", "openalex:W2148764920", "openalex:W2151496011", "openalex:W2164510317", "openalex:W2170685721", "openalex:W2216819074", "openalex:W2233267434", "openalex:W2238482913", "openalex:W2286353276", "openalex:W2316888041", "openalex:W2330525617", "openalex:W2464934902", "openalex:W2471673808", "openalex:W2494623578", "openalex:W2495480366", "openalex:W2497017116", "openalex:W2501269769", "openalex:W2527422040", "openalex:W2530226740", "openalex:W2530626911", "openalex:W2538626945", "openalex:W2556766152", "openalex:W2587961129", "openalex:W2601234273", "openalex:W2622233359", "openalex:W2740852515", "openalex:W2743911451", "openalex:W2753079950", "openalex:W2753125079", "openalex:W2776245503", "openalex:W2783657280", "openalex:W2784507417", "openalex:W2793489997", "openalex:W2796263488", "openalex:W2801508439", "openalex:W2802036381", "openalex:W2802852571", "openalex:W2804138755", "openalex:W2892827380", "openalex:W2896520846", "openalex:W2897022322", "openalex:W2897047539", "openalex:W2905018743", "openalex:W2906034096", "openalex:W2940224800", "openalex:W2952777976", "openalex:W2971077090", "openalex:W3001300116", "openalex:W3020730742", "openalex:W3092947384", "openalex:W4237505602", "openalex:W4237718205", "openalex:W4240568244", "openalex:W4247883378", "openalex:W4255373279", "openalex:W4255449680", "openalex:W4313371762", "openalex:W6602930986", "openalex:W6603463581", "openalex:W6606784186", "openalex:W6610352917", "openalex:W6630014498", "openalex:W6637112478", "openalex:W6656595986", "openalex:W6676557564", "openalex:W6723910800", "openalex:W6752042502", "openalex:W6760454673", "openalex:W6761115458"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Enactivism and predictive processing: a non-representational view", "abstract": "This paper starts by considering an argument for thinking that predictive processing (PP) is representational. This argument suggests that the Kullback-Leibler (KL)-divergence provides an accessible measure of misrepresentation, and therefore, a measure of representational content in hierarchical Bayesian inference. The paper then argues that while the KL-divergence is a measure of information, it does not establish a sufficient measure of representational content. We argue that this follows from the fact that the KL-divergence is a measure of relative entropy, which can be shown to be the same as covariance (through a set of additional steps). It is well known that facts about covariance do not entail facts about representational content. So there is no reason to think that the KL-divergence is a measure of (mis-)representational content. This paper thus provides an enactive, non-representational account of Bayesian belief optimisation in hierarchical PP.", "authors": [{"name": "Michael D.

{"title": "Towards a computational phenomenology of mental action: modelling meta-awareness and attentional control with deep parametric active inference", "abstract": "Abstract Meta-awareness refers to the capacity to explicitly notice the current content of consciousness and has been identified as a key component for the successful control of cognitive states, such as the deliberate direction of attention. This paper proposes a formal model of meta-awareness and attentional control using hierarchical active inference. To do so, we cast mental action as policy selection over higher-level cognitive states and add a further hierarchical level to model meta-awareness states that modulate the expected confidence (precision) in the mapping between observations and hidden cognitive states. We simulate the example of mind-wandering and its regulation during a task involving sustained selective attention on a perceptual object. This provides a computational case study for an inferential architecture that is apt to enable the emergence of these central components of human phenomenology, namely, the ability to access and control cognitive states. We propose that this approach can be generalized to other cognitive states, and hence, this paper provides the first steps towards the development of a computational phenomenology of mental action and more broadly of our ability to monitor and control our own cognitive states.

{"title": "Losing Ourselves: Active Inference, Depersonalization, and Meditation", "abstract": "Disruptions in the ordinary sense of selfhood underpin both pathological and \"enlightened\" states of consciousness. People suffering from depersonalization can experience the loss of a sense of self as devastating, often accompanied by intense feelings of alienation, fear, and hopelessness. However, for meditative contemplatives from various traditions, \"selfless\" experiences are highly sought after, being associated with enduring peace and joy. Little is understood about how these contrasting dysphoric and euphoric experiences should be conceptualized. In this paper, we propose a unified account of these selfless experiences within the active inference framework. Building on our recent active inference research, we propose an account of the experiences of selfhood as emerging from a temporally deep generative model. We go on to develop a view of the self as playing a central role in structuring ordinary experience by \"tuning\" agents to the counterfactually rich possibilities for action. Finally, we explore how depersonalization may result from an inferred loss of allostatic control and contrast this phenomenology with selfless experiences reported by meditation practitioners. We will show how, by beginning with a conception of self-modeling within an active inference framework, we have available to us a new way of conceptualizing the striking experiential similarities and important differences between these selfless experiences within a unifying theoretical framework. We will explore the implications for understanding and treating dissociative disorders, as well as elucidate both the therapeutic potential, and possible dangers, of meditation.", "authors": [{"name": "George Deane", "affiliation": "University of Edinburgh", "orcid": "0000-0003-2418-8282"}, {"name": "Mark Miller", "affiliation": "University of Sussex", "orcid": "0000-0001-5660-8494"}, {"name": "Sam Wilkinson", "affiliation": "University of Exeter", "orcid": "0000-0001-7414-7505"}], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.3389/fpsyg.2020.539726", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W3096810469", "venue": "Frontiers in Psychology", "citation_count": 83, "references": ["openalex:W231615413", "openalex:W629808421", "openalex:W1170968561", "openalex:W1418557530", "openalex:W1515559452", "openalex:W1524895715", "openalex:W1528310605", "openalex:W1550568001", "openalex:W1604740558", "openalex:W1639663099", "openalex:W1797296096", "openalex:W1822854595", "openalex:W1958183871", "openalex:W1966980165", "openalex:W1967826667", "openalex:W1972618942", "openalex:W1975979465", "openalex:W1979445479", "openalex:W1984908695", "openalex:W1991570461", "openalex:W1994259251", "openalex:W2001549123", "openalex:W2002907081", "openalex:W2003131878", "openalex:W2007548649", "openalex:W2007881724", "openalex:W2008950282", "openalex:W2014114527", "openalex:W2032297849", "openalex:W2033613103", "openalex:W2034737533", "openalex:W2052685640", "openalex:W2054741347", "openalex:W2059320470", "openalex:W2060183325", "openalex:W2066562051", "openalex:W2070124482", "openalex:W2072038127", "openalex:W2078508939", "openalex:W2081817157", "openalex:W2090832148", "openalex:W2092700786", "openalex:W2093466600", "openalex:W2105914303", "openalex:W2114063385", "openalex:W2115460576", "openalex:W2116533103", "openalex:W2120238402", "openalex:W2122450331", "openalex:W2122758649", "openalex:W2127958135", "openalex:W2128337230", "openalex:W2130195834", "openalex:W2137255366", "openalex:W2142213531", "openalex:W2142672241", "openalex:W2148398483", "openalex:W2148544865", "openalex:W2148764920", "openalex:W2153791616", "openalex:W2159275967", "openalex:W2159675987", "openalex:W2160195521", "openalex:W2188721763", "openalex:W2283588528", "openalex:W2326788206", "openalex:W2344431521", "openalex:W2395526369", "openalex:W2424475825", "openalex:W2486533162", "openalex:W2489203105", "openalex:W2526764269", "openalex:W2530226740", "openalex:W2538626945", "openalex:W2551311960", "openalex:W2552810632", "openalex:W2564601941", "openalex:W2584391386", "openalex:W2593424870", "openalex:W2605929261", "openalex:W2607092740", "openalex:W2618615166", "openalex:W2726898022", "openalex:W2760880253", "openalex:W2765412958", "openalex:W2774241276", "openalex:W2781668895", "openalex:W2787984105", "openalex:W2802036381", "openalex:W2804153602", "openalex:W2885022223", "openalex:W2887718708", "openalex:W2889373600", "openalex:W2891255848", "openalex:W2892061340", "openalex:W2910207897", "openalex:W2910579481", "openalex:W2914347541", "openalex:W2921413914", "openalex:W2931159036", "openalex:W2942272109", "openalex:W2964507079", "openalex:W2970714527", "openalex:W2994826077", "openalex:W2998334652", "openalex:W3013691404", "openalex:W3033415390", "openalex:W3049709870", "openalex:W3108742966", "openalex:W4214692159", "openalex:W4233973055", "openalex:W4238913164", "openalex:W4246051408", "openalex:W4248432790", "openalex:W4293780049", "openalex:W4301902035", "openalex:W4388284971", "openalex:W6609073413", "openalex:W6632855529", "openalex:W6641098168", "openalex:W6701411375", "openalex:W6724194036", "openalex:W6753569396", "openalex:W6767079518", "openalex:W6778820970", "openalex:W6786767887", "openalex:W6830414654", "openalex:W6842401864"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "A Bioenergetic Basis for Membrane Divergence in Archaea and Bacteria", "abstract": "Membrane bioenergetics are universal, yet the phospholipid membranes of archaea and bacteria-the deepest branches in the tree of life-are fundamentally different. This deep divergence in membrane chemistry is reflected in other stark differences between the two domains, including ion pumping and DNA replication. We resolve this paradox by considering the energy requirements of the last universal common ancestor (LUCA). We develop a mathematical model based on the premise that LUCA depended on natural proton gradients. Our analysis shows that such gradients can power carbon and energy metabolism, but only in leaky cells with a proton permeability equivalent to fatty acid vesicles. Membranes with lower permeability (equivalent to modern phospholipids) collapse free-energy availability, precluding exploitation of natural gradients. Pumping protons across leaky membranes offers no advantage, even when permeability is decreased 1,000-fold. We hypothesize that a sodium-proton antiporter (SPAP) provided the first step towards modern membranes. SPAP increases the free energy available from natural proton gradients by ∼60%, enabling survival in 50-fold lower gradients, thereby facilitating ecological spread and divergence. Critically, SPAP also provides a steadily amplifying advantage to proton pumping as membrane permeability falls, for the first time favoring the evolution of ion-tight phospholipid membranes. The phospholipids of archaea and bacteria incorporate different stereoisomers of glycerol phosphate. We conclude that the enzymes involved took these alternatives by chance in independent populations that had already evolved distinct ion pumps. Our model offers a quantitatively robust explanation for why membrane bioenergetics are universal, yet ion pumps and phospholipid membranes arose later and independently in separate populations.

{"title": "Dynamical Relations in the Self-Pattern", "abstract": "The notion of a self-pattern, as developed in the pattern theory of self (Gallagher, 2013), which holds that the self is best explained in terms of the kind of reality that pertains to a dynamical pattern, acknowledges the importance of neural dynamics, but also expands the account of self to extra-neural (embodied and enactive) dynamics. The pattern theory of self, however, has been criticized for failing to explicate the dynamical relations among elements of the self-pattern (e.g., Kyselo, 2014; Beni, 2016; de Haan et al., 2017); as such, it seems to be nothing more than a mere list of elements. We'll argue that the dynamics of a self-pattern are reflected in three significant and interrelated ways that allow for investigation. First, a self-pattern is reflectively reiterated in its narrative component. Second, studies of psychiatric or neurological disorders can help us understand the precise nature of the dynamical relations in a self-pattern, and how they can fail. Third, referencing predictive processing accounts, neuroscience can also help to explicate the dynamical relations that constitute the self-pattern.", "authors": [{"name": "Shaun Gallagher", "affiliation": "University of Memphis", "orcid": "0000-0002-3147-9929"}, {"name": "Anya Daly", "affiliation": "University College Dublin", "orcid": "0000-0002-4832-6611"}], "year": 2018, "doi": "10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00664", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W2800982817", "venue": "Frontiers in Psychology", "citation_count": 100, "references": ["openalex:W58384076", "openalex:W109508954", "openalex:W379488513", "openalex:W595146729", "openalex:W604995265", "openalex:W1482169100", "openalex:W1483588863", "openalex:W1494456132", "openalex:W1521840166", "openalex:W1526742582", "openalex:W1544361543", "openalex:W1550568001", "openalex:W1567089404", "openalex:W1571694883", "openalex:W1572404682", "openalex:W1577654213", "openalex:W1598022955", "openalex:W1609369692", "openalex:W1916207017", "openalex:W1950864686", "openalex:W1962900566", "openalex:W1968940530", "openalex:W1969133143", "openalex:W1971404739", "openalex:W1974549833", "openalex:W1977172910", "openalex:W1978958112", "openalex:W1979311208", "openalex:W1980178978", "openalex:W1985274129", "openalex:W1987002300", "openalex:W1988744735", "openalex:W1989248721", "openalex:W1992467845", "openalex:W1993263395", "openalex:W1994259251", "openalex:W1998031809", "openalex:W1998939912", "openalex:W2003062335", "openalex:W2003763571", "openalex:W2006744517", "openalex:W2006961143", "openalex:W2010358983", "openalex:W2013354438", "openalex:W2015842256", "openalex:W2018533701", "openalex:W2025485131", "openalex:W2026985064", "openalex:W2029695972", "openalex:W2036916152", "openalex:W2041251180", "openalex:W2043926548", "openalex:W2047413864", "openalex:W2048072754", "openalex:W2048494323", "openalex:W2049107249", "openalex:W2052685640", "openalex:W2052781595", "openalex:W2053192197", "openalex:W2060565253", "openalex:W2060992353", "openalex:W2070417514", "openalex:W2070461647", "openalex:W2074835479", "openalex:W2076189397", "openalex:W2079117350", "openalex:W2079850751", "openalex:W2081875424", "openalex:W2082556623", "openalex:W2083338950", "openalex:W2086054016", "openalex:W2089290315", "openalex:W2091938376", "openalex:W2093484810", "openalex:W2094753812", "openalex:W2097255636", "openalex:W2098523016", "openalex:W2100772444", "openalex:W2101744684", "openalex:W2105872933", "openalex:W2106680734", "openalex:W2107871123", "openalex:W2110040374", "openalex:W2110247644", "openalex:W2110550201", "openalex:W2116929833", "openalex:W2126233790", "openalex:W2127345956", "openalex:W2127958135", "openalex:W2128508364", "openalex:W2130195834", "openalex:W2134555016", "openalex:W2138567871", "openalex:W2139349369", "openalex:W2141183879", "openalex:W2148544865", "openalex:W2148764920", "openalex:W2151496011", "openalex:W2151740100", "openalex:W2155225268", "openalex:W2160195521", "openalex:W2163530817", "openalex:W2168782888", "openalex:W2171627550", "openalex:W2282634802", "openalex:W2287100580", "openalex:W2299731887", "openalex:W2338194712", "openalex:W2338724465", "openalex:W2414309630", "openalex:W2418703029", "openalex:W2488564704", "openalex:W2521328095", "openalex:W2534098824", "openalex:W2558206955", "openalex:W2564787725", "openalex:W2591458607", "openalex:W2594295112", "openalex:W2603171575", "openalex:W2607174631", "openalex:W2617368327", "openalex:W2624301632", "openalex:W2731578590", "openalex:W2757399398", "openalex:W2761971242", "openalex:W2782436719", "openalex:W2798773998", "openalex:W3115952820", "openalex:W3171389120", "openalex:W4230736257", "openalex:W4240415862", "openalex:W4244092811", "openalex:W4244726413", "openalex:W4245595367", "openalex:W4247883378", "openalex:W4248169967", "openalex:W4249609777", "openalex:W4249629992", "openalex:W4293780049", "openalex:W4388215905", "openalex:W6602325105", "openalex:W6604460371", "openalex:W6632855529", "openalex:W6634616096", "openalex:W6636338616", "openalex:W6636562699", "openalex:W6733985108", "openalex:W6735652675", "openalex:W6738594607", "openalex:W6739049765", "openalex:W6739553484", "openalex:W6744645933", "openalex:W6797180378", "openalex:W6806466991", "openalex:W6842401864"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Computational psychiatry: from synapses to sentience", "abstract": "Abstract This review considers computational psychiatry from a particular viewpoint: namely, a commitment to explaining psychopathology in terms of pathophysiology. It rests on the notion of a generative model as underwriting (i) sentient processing in the brain, and (ii) the scientific process in psychiatry. The story starts with a view of the brain—from cognitive and computational neuroscience—as an organ of inference and prediction. This offers a formal description of neuronal message passing, distributed processing and belief propagation in neuronal networks; and how certain kinds of dysconnection lead to aberrant belief updating and false inference. The dysconnections in question can be read as a pernicious synaptopathy that fits comfortably with formal notions of how we—or our brains—encode uncertainty or its complement, precision . It then considers how the ensuing process theories are tested empirically, with an emphasis on the computational modelling of neuronal circuits and synaptic gain control that mediates attentional set, active inference, learning and planning. The opportunities afforded by this sort of modelling are considered in light of in silico experiments; namely, computational neuropsychology, computational phenotyping and the promises of a computational nosology for psychiatry. The resulting survey of computational approaches is not scholarly or exhaustive. Rather, its aim is to review a theoretical narrative that is emerging across subdisciplines within psychiatry and empirical scales of investigation. These range from epilepsy research to neurodegenerative disorders; from post-traumatic stress disorder to the management of chronic pain, from schizophrenia to functional medical symptoms.",

{"title": "Toward a Neurobiologically Plausible Model of Language-Related, Negative Event-Related Potentials", "abstract": "Language-related event-related potential (ERP) components such as the N400 have traditionally been associated with linguistic or cognitive functional interpretations. By contrast, it has been considerably more difficult to relate these components to neurobiologically grounded accounts of language. Here, we propose a theoretical framework based on a predictive coding architecture, within which negative language-related ERP components such as the N400 can be accounted for in a neurobiologically plausible manner. Specifically, we posit that the amplitude of negative language-related ERP components reflects precision-weighted prediction error signals, i.e., prediction errors weighted by the relevance of the information source leading to the error. From this perspective, precision has a direct link to cue validity in a particular language and, thereby, to relevance of individual linguistic features for internal model updating. We view components such as the N400 and LAN as members of a family with similar functional characteristics and suggest that latency and topography differences between these components reflect the locus of prediction errors and model updating within a hierarchically organized cortical predictive coding architecture. This account has the potential to unify findings from the full range of the N400 literature, including word-level, sentence-, and discourse-level results as well as cross-linguistic differences.", "authors": [{"name": "Ina Bornkessel‐Schlesewsky", "affiliation": "University of South Australia", "orcid": "0000-0002-3238-6492"}, {"name": "Matthias Schlesewsky", "affiliation": "University of South Australia", "orcid": null}], "year": 2019, "doi": "10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00298", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W2913191925", "venue": "Frontiers in Psychology", "citation_count": 198, "references": ["openalex:W1521911963", "openalex:W1858297205", "openalex:W1965160310", "openalex:W1968108219", "openalex:W1969836035", "openalex:W1970986336", "openalex:W1971181633", "openalex:W1975764941", "openalex:W1977245979", "openalex:W1978415413", "openalex:W1981319657", "openalex:W1982350233", "openalex:W1983863203", "openalex:W1985982445", "openalex:W1986172228", "openalex:W1987162672", "openalex:W1991825895", "openalex:W1991865342", "openalex:W1993987901", "openalex:W2000244215", "openalex:W2000454627", "openalex:W2000491180", "openalex:W2000550024", "openalex:W2001427019", "openalex:W2007997142", "openalex:W2008779926", "openalex:W2010247283", "openalex:W2010249628", "openalex:W2010991551", "openalex:W2011846113", "openalex:W2012236514", "openalex:W2013334667", "openalex:W2016760949", "openalex:W2024175530", "openalex:W2026255022", "openalex:W2028675369", "openalex:W2030802915", "openalex:W2032409672", "openalex:W2034249692", "openalex:W2035054082", "openalex:W2040504348", "openalex:W2041221140", "openalex:W2041301700", "openalex:W2048389025", "openalex:W2048531701", "openalex:W2051064396", "openalex:W2054858744", "openalex:W2057508188", "openalex:W2062875997", "openalex:W2065671757", "openalex:W2067477726", "openalex:W2069474802", "openalex:W2082784515", "openalex:W2085989895", "openalex:W2086508845", "openalex:W2089485783", "openalex:W2090808068", "openalex:W2091855894", "openalex:W2096575147", "openalex:W2096962395", "openalex:W2098580305", "openalex:W2099679614", "openalex:W2100425115", "openalex:W2100727553", "openalex:W2104049715", "openalex:W2104640717", "openalex:W2104860995", "openalex:W2105623576", "openalex:W2114274516", "openalex:W2115041995", "openalex:W2116895829", "openalex:W2118310463", "openalex:W2119499464", "openalex:W2119667556", "openalex:W2119728020", "openalex:W2119885245", "openalex:W2120061384", "openalex:W2120079537", "openalex:W2120327449", "openalex:W2122741244", "openalex:W2123786976", "openalex:W2124919060", "openalex:W2127958135", "openalex:W2128134362", "openalex:W2130195133", "openalex:W2130987742", "openalex:W2133808818", "openalex:W2135961695", "openalex:W2140555726", "openalex:W2141138276", "openalex:W2141439111", "openalex:W2142009972", "openalex:W2144179387", "openalex:W2144597460", "openalex:W2145433809", "openalex:W2148764920", "openalex:W2150104820", "openalex:W2153705299", "openalex:W2156422237", "openalex:W2156630072", "openalex:W2160538606", "openalex:W2164051460", "openalex:W2164418233", "openalex:W2165097107", "openalex:W2170522204", "openalex:W2171024980", "openalex:W2172157752", "openalex:W2179376720", "openalex:W2189430370", "openalex:W2195506630", "openalex:W2243296507", "openalex:W2338040292", "openalex:W2342094040", "openalex:W2463330366", "openalex:W2554838917", "openalex:W2558018792", "openalex:W2596174653", "openalex:W2743406877", "openalex:W2793200271", "openalex:W2796350793", "openalex:W2888021002", "openalex:W2888625409", "openalex:W2899825144", "openalex:W2901252526", "openalex:W2905378591", "openalex:W2908017615", "openalex:W2949350555", "openalex:W4247883378", "openalex:W6635224564", "openalex:W6725309783", "openalex:W6948706475"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Precision and False Perceptual Inference", "abstract": "Accurate perceptual inference fundamentally depends upon accurate beliefs about the reliability of sensory data. In this paper, we describe a Bayes optimal and biologically plausible scheme that refines these beliefs through a gradient descent on variational free energy. To illustrate this, we simulate belief updating during visual foraging and show that changes in estimated sensory precision (i.e., confidence in visual data) are highly sensitive to prior beliefs about the contents of a visual scene. In brief, confident prior beliefs induce an increase in estimated precision when consistent with sensory evidence, but a decrease when they conflict. Prior beliefs held with low confidence are rapidly updated to posterior beliefs, determined by sensory data. These induce much smaller changes in beliefs about sensory precision. We argue that pathologies of scene construction may be due to abnormal priors, and show that these can induce a reduction in estimated sensory precision. Having previously associated this precision with cholinergic signaling, we note that several neurodegenerative conditions are associated with visual disturbances and cholinergic deficits; notably, the synucleinopathies. On relating the message passing in our model to the functional anatomy of the ventral visual stream, we find that simulated neuronal loss in temporal lobe regions induces confident, inaccurate, empirical prior beliefs at lower levels in the visual hierarchy. This provides a plausible, if speculative, computational mechanism for the loss of cholinergic signaling and the visual disturbances associated with temporal lobe Lewy body pathology. This may be seen as an illustration of the sorts of hypotheses that may be expressed within this computational framework.", "authors": [{"name": "Thomas Parr", "affiliation": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging", "orcid": "0000-0001-5108-5743"}, {"name": "David Benrimoh", "affiliation": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging", "orcid": "0000-0002-1452-4791"}, {"name": "Peter Vincent", "affiliation": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging", "orcid": "0000-0002-2641-1874"}, {"name": "Karl Friston", "affiliation": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging", "orcid": "0000-0001-7984-8909"}], "year": 2018, "doi": "10.3389/fnint.2018.00039", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": null, "openalex_id": "https://openalex.org/W2890724683", "venue": "Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience", "citation_count": 92, "references": ["openalex:W1524895715", "openalex:W1948740236", "openalex:W1964316244", "openalex:W1965080971", "openalex:W1968001820", "openalex:W1968684705", "openalex:W1974590920", "openalex:W1974607544", "openalex:W1975700187", "openalex:W1981355297", "openalex:W1994067502", "openalex:W1994892978", "openalex:W1995485240", "openalex:W1995515444", "openalex:W1996216125", "openalex:W2003984303", "openalex:W2004928043", "openalex:W2007782200", "openalex:W2007997142", "openalex:W2013554506", "openalex:W2016468036", "openalex:W2024154183", "openalex:W2034046047", "openalex:W2034530882", "openalex:W2042250149", "openalex:W2050028249", "openalex:W2056452833", "openalex:W2057784346", "openalex:W2059320470", "openalex:W2066835186", "openalex:W2071604397", "openalex:W2073833615", "openalex:W2082641523", "openalex:W2085989895", "openalex:W2086124986", "openalex:W2087485448", "openalex:W2089159943", "openalex:W2094342172", "openalex:W2096962395", "openalex:W2098580305", "openalex:W2103079335", "openalex:W2103212315", "openalex:W2104156437", "openalex:W2107423869", "openalex:W2110258654", "openalex:W2111405839", "openalex:W2114786345", "openalex:W2115979064", "openalex:W2116533103", "openalex:W2123185995", "openalex:W2125935651", "openalex:W2126190962", "openalex:W2127108053", "openalex:W2127531110", "openalex:W2130195834", "openalex:W2130432173", "openalex:W2133166069", "openalex:W2135134122", "openalex:W2140487181", "openalex:W2140952948", "openalex:W2151424605", "openalex:W2154562678", "openalex:W2168202614", "openalex:W2276024626", "openalex:W2414486637", "openalex:W2424475825", "openalex:W2464928795", "openalex:W2474900144", "openalex:W2552810632", "openalex:W2555795336", "openalex:W2606488938", "openalex:W2610429044", "openalex:W2623066203", "openalex:W2744346435", "openalex:W2765383588", "openalex:W2769704218", "openalex:W2770517318", "openalex:W2782189646", "openalex:W2794957743", "openalex:W4211253537", "openalex:W4232663066", "openalex:W6679277341"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "The Energy Homeostasis Principle: Neuronal Energy Regulation Drives Local Network Dynamics Generating Behavior", "abstract": "A major goal of neuroscience is understanding how neurons arrange themselves into neural networks that result in behavior. Most theoretical and experimental efforts have focused on a top-down approach which seeks to identify neuronal correlates of behaviors. This has been accomplished by effectively mapping specific behaviors to distinct neural patterns, or by creating computational models that produce a desired behavioral outcome. Nonetheless, these approaches have only implicitly considered the fact that neural tissue, like any other physical system, is subjected to several restrictions and boundaries of operations. Here, we proposed a new, bottom-up conceptual paradigm: The Energy Homeostasis Principle, where the balance between energy income, expenditure, and availability are the key parameters in determining the dynamics of neuronal phenomena found from molecular to behavioral levels. Neurons display high energy consumption relative to other cells, with metabolic consumption of the brain representing 20% of the whole-body oxygen uptake, contrasting with this organ representing only 2% of the body weight. Also, neurons have specialized surrounding tissue providing the necessary energy which, in the case of the brain, is provided by astrocytes. Moreover, and unlike other cell types with high energy demands such as muscle cells, neurons have strict aerobic metabolism. These facts indicate that neurons are highly sensitive to energy limitations, with Gibb's free energy dictating the direction of all cellular metabolic processes. From this activity, the largest energy, by far, is expended by action potentials and post-synaptic potentials; therefore, plasticity can be reinterpreted in terms of their energy context. Consequently, neurons, through their synapses, impose energy demands over post-synaptic neurons in a close loop-manner, modulating the dynamics of local circuits. Subsequently, the energy dynamics end up impacting the homeostatic mechanisms of neuronal networks. Furthermore, local energy management also emerges as a neural population property, where most of the energy expenses are triggered by sensory or other modulatory inputs. Local energy management in neurons may be sufficient to explain the emergence of behavior, enabling the assessment of which properties arise in neural circuits and how. Essentially, the proposal of the Energy Homeostasis Principle is also readily testable for simple neuronal networks.", "authors": [{"name": "Rodrigo C.

{"title": "Attention promotes the neural encoding of prediction errors", "abstract": "The encoding of sensory information in the human brain is thought to be optimised by two principal processes: 'prediction' uses stored information to guide the interpretation of forthcoming sensory events, and 'attention' prioritizes these events according to their behavioural relevance. Despite the ubiquitous contributions of attention and prediction to various aspects of perception and cognition, it remains unknown how they interact to modulate information processing in the brain. A recent extension of predictive coding theory suggests that attention optimises the expected precision of predictions by modulating the synaptic gain of prediction error units. Because prediction errors code for the difference between predictions and sensory signals, this model would suggest that attention increases the selectivity for mismatch information in the neural response to a surprising stimulus. Alternative predictive coding models propose that attention increases the activity of prediction (or 'representation') neurons and would therefore suggest that attention and prediction synergistically modulate selectivity for 'feature information' in the brain. Here, we applied forward encoding models to neural activity recorded via electroencephalography (EEG) as human observers performed a simple visual task to test for the effect of attention on both mismatch and feature information in the neural response to surprising stimuli. Participants attended or ignored a periodic stream of gratings, the orientations of which could be either predictable, surprising, or unpredictable. We found that surprising stimuli evoked neural responses that were encoded according to the difference between predicted and observed stimulus features, and that attention facilitated the encoding of this type of information in the brain. These findings advance our understanding of how attention and prediction modulate information processing in the brain, as well as support the theory that attention optimises precision expectations during hierarchical inference by increasing the gain of prediction errors.", "authors": [{"name": "Cooper Smout", "affiliation": "Australian Research Council", "orcid": "0000-0003-1144-3272"}, {"name": "Matthew F.

{"title": "Unsupervised deep learning identifies semantic disentanglement in single inferotemporal face patch neurons", "abstract": "Abstract In order to better understand how the brain perceives faces, it is important to know what objective drives learning in the ventral visual stream. To answer this question, we model neural responses to faces in the macaque inferotemporal (IT) cortex with a deep self-supervised generative model, β -VAE, which disentangles sensory data into interpretable latent factors, such as gender or age. Our results demonstrate a strong correspondence between the generative factors discovered by β -VAE and those coded by single IT neurons, beyond that found for the baselines, including the handcrafted state-of-the-art model of face perception, the Active Appearance Model, and deep classifiers. Moreover, β -VAE is able to reconstruct novel face images using signals from just a handful of cells. Together our results imply that optimising the disentangling objective leads to representations that closely resemble those in the IT at the single unit level. This points at disentangling as a plausible learning objective for the visual brain.", "authors": [{"name": "Irina Higgins", "affiliation": "DeepMind (United Kingdom)", "orcid": "0000-0002-1890-2091"}, {"name": "Le Chang", "affiliation": "Center for Excellence in Brain Science and Intelligence Technology", "orcid": "0000-0001-8713-4412"}, {"name": "Victoria Langston", "affiliation": "DeepMind (United Kingdom)", "orcid": null}, {"name": "Demis Hassabis", "affiliation": "DeepMind (United Kingdom)", "orcid": "0000-0003-2812-9917"}, {"name": "Christopher Summerfield", "affiliation": "DeepMind (United Kingdom)", "orcid": "0000-0002-2941-2653"}, {"name": "Doris Y.

{"title": "What is value—accumulated reward or evidence?", "abstract": "Why are you reading this abstract? In some sense, your answer will cast the exercise as valuable-but what is value? In what follows, we suggest that value is evidence or, more exactly, log Bayesian evidence. This implies that a sufficient explanation for valuable behavior is the accumulation of evidence for internal models of our world. This contrasts with normative models of optimal control and reinforcement learning, which assume the existence of a value function that explains behavior, where (somewhat tautologically) behavior maximizes value. In this paper, we consider an alternative formulation-active inference-that replaces policies in normative models with prior beliefs about the (future) states agents should occupy. This enables optimal behavior to be cast purely in terms of inference: where agents sample their sensorium to maximize the evidence for their generative model of hidden states in the world, and minimize their uncertainty about those states. Crucially, this formulation resolves the tautology inherent in normative models and allows one to consider how prior beliefs are themselves optimized in a hierarchical setting. We illustrate these points by showing that any optimal policy can be specified with prior beliefs in the context of Bayesian inference. We then show how these prior beliefs are themselves prescribed by an imperative to minimize uncertainty.

{"title": "Self-orthogonalizing attractor neural networks emerging from the free energy principle", "abstract": "Attractor dynamics are a hallmark of many complex systems, including the brain. Understanding how such self-organizing dynamics emerge from first principles is crucial for advancing our understanding of neuronal computations and the design of artificial intelligence systems. Here we formalize how attractor networks emerge from the free energy principle applied to a universal partitioning of random dynamical systems. Our approach obviates the need for explicitly imposed learning and inference rules and identifies emergent, but efficient and biologically plausible inference and learning dynamics for such self-organizing systems. These result in a collective, multi-level Bayesian active inference process. Attractors on the free energy landscape encode prior beliefs; inference integrates sensory data into posterior beliefs; and learning fine-tunes couplings to minimize long-term surprise. Analytically and via simulations, we establish that the proposed networks favor approximately orthogonalized attractor representations, a consequence of simultaneously optimizing predictive accuracy and model complexity. These attractors efficiently span the input subspace, enhancing generalization and the mutual information between hidden causes and observable effects. Furthermore, while random data presentation leads to symmetric and sparse couplings, sequential data fosters asymmetric couplings and non-equilibrium steady-state dynamics, offering a natural extension to conventional Boltzmann Machines. Our findings offer a unifying theory of self-organizing attractor networks, providing novel insights for AI and neuroscience.", "authors": [{"name": "Tamas Spisak", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "K.

{"title": "Active Vision for Robot Manipulators Using the Free Energy Principle", "abstract": "Occlusions, restricted field of view and limited resolution all constrain a robot's ability to sense its environment from a single observation. In these cases, the robot first needs to actively query multiple observations and accumulate information before it can complete a task. In this paper, we cast this problem of active vision as active inference, which states that an intelligent agent maintains a generative model of its environment and acts in order to minimize its surprise, or expected free energy according to this model. We apply this to an object-reaching task for a 7-DOF robotic manipulator with an in-hand camera to scan the workspace. A novel generative model using deep neural networks is proposed that is able to fuse multiple views into an abstract representation and is trained from data by minimizing variational free energy. We validate our approach experimentally for a reaching task in simulation in which a robotic agent starts without any knowledge about its workspace. Each step, the next view pose is chosen by evaluating the expected free energy. We find that by minimizing the expected free energy, exploratory behavior emerges when the target object to reach is not in view, and the end effector is moved to the correct reach position once the target is located. Similar to an owl scavenging for prey, the robot naturally prefers higher ground for exploring, approaching its target once located.", "authors": [{"name": "Toon Van de Maele", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Tim Verbelen", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Ozan Çatal", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "C.

{"title": "A Neural Network Implementation for Free Energy Principle", "abstract": "The free energy principle (FEP), as an encompassing framework and a unified brain theory, has been widely applied to account for various problems in fields such as cognitive science, neuroscience, social interaction, and hermeneutics. As a computational model deeply rooted in math and statistics, FEP posits an optimization problem based on variational Bayes, which is solved either by dynamic programming or expectation maximization in practice. However, there seems to be a bottleneck in extending the FEP to machine learning and implementing such models with neural networks. This paper gives a preliminary attempt at bridging FEP and machine learning, via a classical neural network model, the Helmholtz machine. As a variational machine learning model, the Helmholtz machine is optimized by minimizing its free energy, the same objective as FEP. Although the Helmholtz machine is not temporal, it gives an ideal parallel to the vanilla FEP and the hierarchical model of the brain, under which the active inference and predictive coding could be formulated coherently. Besides a detailed theoretical discussion, the paper also presents a preliminary experiment to validate the hypothesis. By fine-tuning the trained neural network through active inference, the model performance is promoted to accuracy above 99\\%.

{"title": "Expected Free Energy-based Planning as Variational Inference", "abstract": "We address the problem of planning under uncertainty, where an agent must choose actions that not only achieve desired outcomes but also reduce uncertainty. Traditional methods often treat exploration and exploitation as separate objectives, lacking a unified inferential foundation. Active inference, grounded in the Free Energy Principle, provides such a foundation by minimizing Expected Free Energy (EFE), a cost function that combines utility with epistemic drives, such as ambiguity resolution and novelty seeking. However, the computational burden of EFE minimization had remained a significant obstacle to its scalability. In this paper, we show that EFE-based planning arises naturally from minimizing a variational free energy functional on a generative model augmented with preference and epistemic priors. This result reinforces theoretical consistency with the Free Energy Principle by casting planning under uncertainty itself as a form of variational inference. Our formulation yields policies that jointly support goal achievement and information gain, while incorporating a complexity term that accounts for bounded computational resources. This unifying framework connects and extends existing methods, enabling scalable, resource-aware implementations of active inference agents.", "authors": [{"name": "Bert de Vries", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Wouter W.

{"title": "Active Inference for Energy Control and Planning in Smart Buildings and Communities", "abstract": "Active Inference (AIF) is emerging as a powerful framework for decision-making under uncertainty, yet its potential in engineering applications remains largely unexplored. In this work, we propose a novel dual-layer AIF architecture that addresses both building-level and communitylevel energy management. By leveraging the free energy principle, each layer adapts to evolving conditions and handles partial observability without extensive sensor information and respecting data privacy. We validate the continuous AIF model against both a perfect optimization baseline and a reinforcement learning-based approach. We also test the community AIF framework under extreme pricing scenarios. The results highlight the model's robustness in handling abrupt changes. This study is the first to show how a distributed AIF works in engineering.

{"title": "Free Energy Principle for the Noise Smoothness Estimation of Linear Systems with Colored Noise", "abstract": "The free energy principle (FEP) from neuroscience provides a framework called active inference for the joint estimation and control of state space systems, subjected to colored noise. However, the active inference community has been challenged with the critical task of manually tuning the noise smoothness parameter. To solve this problem, we introduce a novel online noise smoothness estimator based on the idea of free energy principle. We mathematically show that our estimator can converge to the free energy optimum during smoothness estimation. Using this formulation, we introduce a joint state and noise smoothness observer design called DEMs. Through rigorous simulations, we show that DEMs outperforms state-of-the-art state observers with least state estimation error. Finally, we provide a proof of concept for DEMs by applying it on a real life robotics problem - state estimation of a quadrotor hovering in wind, demonstrating its practical use.", "authors": [{"name": "A.

{"title": "Applications of the Free Energy Principle to Machine Learning and Neuroscience", "abstract": "In this PhD thesis, we explore and apply methods inspired by the free energy principle to two important areas in machine learning and neuroscience. The free energy principle is a general mathematical theory of the necessary information-theoretic behaviours of systems that maintain a separation from their environment. A core postulate of the theory is that complex systems can be seen as performing variational Bayesian inference and minimizing an information-theoretic quantity called the variational free energy. The thesis is structured into three independent sections. Firstly, we focus on predictive coding, a neurobiologically plausible process theory derived from the free energy principle which argues that the primary function of the brain is to minimize prediction errors, showing how predictive coding can be scaled up and extended to be more biologically plausible, and elucidating its close links with other methods such as Kalman Filtering. Secondly, we study active inference, a neurobiologically grounded account of action through variational message passing, and investigate how these methods can be scaled up to match the performance of deep reinforcement learning methods. We additionally provide a detailed mathematical understanding of the nature and origin of the information-theoretic objectives that underlie exploratory behaviour. Finally, we investigate biologically plausible methods of credit assignment in the brain. We first demonstrate a close link between predictive coding and the backpropagation of error algorithm. We go on to propose novel and simpler algorithms which allow for backprop to be implemented in purely local, biologically plausible computations.", "authors": [{"name": "Beren Millidge",

{"title": "The anticipating brain is not a scientist: the free-energy principle from an ecological-enactive perspective", "abstract": "In this paper, we argue for a theoretical separation of the free-energy principle from Helmholtzian accounts of the predictive brain. The free-energy principle is a theoretical framework capturing the imperative for biological self-organization in information-theoretic terms. The free-energy principle has typically been connected with a Bayesian theory of predictive coding, and the latter is often taken to support a Helmholtzian theory of perception as unconscious inference. If our interpretation is right, however, a Helmholtzian view of perception is incompatible with Bayesian predictive coding under the free-energy principle. We argue that the free energy principle and the ecological and enactive approach to mind and life make for a much happier marriage of ideas. We make our argument based on three points. First we argue that the free energy principle applies to the whole animal–environment system, and not only to the brain. Second, we show that active inference, as understood by the free-energy principle, is incompatible with unconscious inference understood as analagous to scientific hypothesis-testing, the main tenet of a Helmholtzian view of perception. Third, we argue that the notion of inference at work in Bayesian predictive coding under the free-energy principle is too weak to support a Helmholtzian theory of perception. Taken together these points imply that the free energy principle is best understood in ecological and enactive terms set out in this paper.", "authors": [{"name": "J.

{"title": "Resilient by Design - Active Inference for Distributed Continuum Intelligence", "abstract": "Failures are the norm in highly complex and heterogeneous devices spanning the distributed computing continuum (DCC), from resource-constrained IoT and edge nodes to high-performance computing systems. Ensuring reliability and global consistency across these layers remains a major challenge, especially for AI-driven workloads requiring real-time, adaptive coordination. This work-in-progress paper introduces a Probabilistic Active Inference Resilience Agent (PAIR-Agent) to achieve resilience in DCC systems. PAIR-Agent performs three core operations: (i) constructing a causal fault graph from device logs, (ii) identifying faults while managing certainties and uncertainties using Markov blankets and the free energy principle, and (iii) autonomously healing issues through active inference. Through continuous monitoring and adaptive reconfiguration, the agent maintains service continuity and stability under diverse failure conditions.

In this work, we propose a DT enabled with Active Inference (AIF), a framework rooted in the Free Energy Principle, to endow DTs with predictive and decision-making capabilities. Our approach is evaluated on a realistic edge computing scenario where two co-located video processing services—a computer vision pipeline using YOLOv8 and a QR code reader—compete for limited CPU resources. The DT continuously infers physical twin state, predicts future performance, and selects actions to meet Service Level Objectives (SLOs). In a series of experiments, we validate the predictive accuracy and control effectiveness of the AIF-enabled DT.

{"title": "Deep Active Inference with Diffusion Policy and Multiple Timescale World Model for Real-World Exploration and Navigation", "abstract": "Autonomous robotic navigation in real-world environments requires exploration to acquire environmental information as well as goal-directed navigation in order to reach specified targets. Active inference (AIF) based on the free-energy principle provides a unified framework for these behaviors by minimizing the expected free energy (EFE), thereby combining epistemic and extrinsic values. To realize this practically, we propose a deep AIF framework that integrates a diffusion policy as the policy model and a multiple timescale recurrent state-space model (MTRSSM) as the world model. The diffusion policy generates diverse candidate actions while the MTRSSM predicts their long-horizon consequences through latent imagination, enabling action selection that minimizes EFE. Real-world navigation experiments demonstrated that our framework achieved higher success rates and fewer collisions compared with the baselines, particularly in exploration-demanding scenarios.

{"title": "Emergence of Goal-Directed Behaviors via Active Inference with Self-Prior", "abstract": "Infants often exhibit goal-directed behaviors, such as reaching for a sensory stimulus, even when no external reward criterion is provided. These intrinsically motivated behaviors facilitate spontaneous exploration and learning of the body and environment during early developmental stages. Although computational modeling can offer insight into the mechanisms underlying such behaviors, many existing studies on intrinsic motivation focus primarily on how exploration contributes to acquiring external rewards. In this paper, we propose a novel density model for an agent's own multimodal sensory experiences, called the\"self-prior,\"and investigate whether it can autonomously induce goal-directed behavior. Integrated within an active inference framework based on the free energy principle, the self-prior generates behavioral references purely from an intrinsic process that minimizes mismatches between average past sensory experiences and current observations. This mechanism is also analogous to the acquisition and utilization of a body schema through continuous interaction with the environment. We examine this approach in a simulated environment and confirm that the agent spontaneously reaches toward a tactile stimulus. Our study implements intrinsically motivated behavior shaped by the agent's own sensory experiences, demonstrating the spontaneous emergence of intentional behavior during early development.", "authors": [{"name": "Dongmin Kim", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Hoshinori Kanazawa", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Naoto Yoshida", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Yasuo Kuniyoshi", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2025, "doi": "10.48550/arXiv.2504.11075", "arxiv_id": "2504.11075", "s2_id": "39ee5cf6d5c5566275015a23a370ba530f1422b0", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "arXiv.org", "citation_count": 0, "references": ["s2:b288dc07aeaf6e9cb1dff6f2fbbcb3ab1b0cbda2", "s2:c3829409915c802108c329a22598bee2924cecee", "s2:daf60c7025f48fb155c0baeed537a1197ea32231", "s2:2b9156e4618d31c850ec3522cdc3941d249ee79a", "s2:c64a99ec780d5e1c6ba242a82e72e96eb0c3ef8a", "s2:c2fbdb0259c45c44590cfc8e1a6465a485f58ab6", "s2:8a6b3a7c7c9ab560621a88cf453bcafce7fa6240", "s2:fd62c58dfebcb0ef5dd8231086e174866a7ba548", "s2:6525e8db085289c8ad85640a7f9343f626cac951", "s2:2fec20377bc947ec1df003b4aedcb4d7f25ac934", "s2:d825092cebfba0321e821d669e837fc03d5fb1f9", "s2:adc4df3c3c5bfaecb5510cf97da0d441938f5ab9", "s2:2197f3c2270f267e5e37d0e3e51979d1304cf9dd", "s2:2d366c82e84b24b1ac0302dc349275f44359a435", "s2:b44755c313ca58bc9c6682e7fe7df6fbde636cca", "s2:b14a0481f472fd04247a21c402a2aff9fd7ba7e4", "s2:7aceb9dc66fc94f254ecf31d057fc9d01d381698", "s2:d0984a8c32d25b5c4de1acf697b71613e5a1d6b8", "s2:0f1440184094a1fc3483fbc2d36eae2e1c88851d", "s2:270b95262f2100c279c4c65ef2521473841ca8ad", "s2:def8207fb6457f3c2656bac9f2bbf954de1d7de1", "s2:1eeb265595e250cf66751ef9032524386d7a9b32", "s2:6e1c0cc6eab09abad6cb7bf2fa3411da934404b9", "s2:fea3e63c97c7292dc6fbcb3ffe7131eb54053986", "s2:71255c5df891501ea99cc02e8699fb0c231658e4", "s2:5b01eaef54a653ba03ddd5a978690380fbc19bfc", "s2:811df72e210e20de99719539505da54762a11c6d", "s2:1c167b1ce9928d46259937bb13dbc2c6ef7aed8f", "s2:38d20f58858b89aeb301d535f6b85ff60e35eb5f", "s2:08531334c9fcdc25539fba81cac1a169c9a33548", "s2:204e3073870fae3d05bcbc2f6a8e263d9b72e776", "s2:225ab689f41cef1dc18237ef5dab059a49950abf", "s2:8011e5235817407b860d5d92a8ff45e31b2bf030", "s2:d316c82c12cf4c45f9e85211ef3d1fa62497bff8", "s2:ac3ee98020251797c2b401e1389461df88e52e62", "s2:1a762016eff98e53f6f6dc6422bc8d4954dce840", "s2:ea210f761a19395d4b70f53dec2b6f446db22ebe", "s2:d3d46b88cea1eda7fda69a58bad1203488cb607e", "s2:33224ad0cdf6e2dc4893194dd587309c7887f0ba", "s2:1ed6a4a10589618d4f26350f1a296ee767ceff6b", "s2:e8077729ef723d71a0b7492f2f271ae413b5a4d5", "s2:dcec053d0536d99970c5d3ebf684b34c2dde3ec5", "s2:40c43f01ce33b7ea1c4847b3674b80a93b5737ed", "s2:28aee0045135075bca14d4cbd91e76041af08081", "s2:b91c1fb08a822b5e28f1d88d63638281132fb1eb", "s2:4d088ffe25ae4251ccebcabd58fbc9aff63e1d33", "s2:38a4bc276fb3820dad9c85c201ef567cd93c07e6", "s2:eadc9dd5321154780ac12e4996095f52b4cdce2c", "s2:d125b9e7bea779f2c6b2e71c65ce358eb4265d06", "s2:40806698b251b69208601d046519e5ccd7b20b67", "s2:b55987b4cfff292dd121ee03c46b41f4f696136e", "s2:5e63a80fe45cc1ee08a624c56fc32f5708d46bef", "s2:da3e4a8ad14b66c60e838def7ad4ed656190969b", "s2:837825503d85be8e70ef4161c08c8e5a589922ca", "s2:3b3903f7914483e21576f9d098e611deef95ec45"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Evaluation of Person Search System Using Multidirectional Cameras and a Drone Based on Active Inference", "abstract": "In recent years, there has been an increasing expectation to understand and utilize information from physical space. However, the vast amount of information, including historical data, makes it inevitable that some information will be missing in the virtual space. Active inference, based on the free energy principle, is a control framework that captures the uncertainty and ambiguity of information, allowing for the observation of objects and inference of one’s own actions. In active inference, an agent probabilistically infers the state of the environment by combining prior beliefs about the state with observational results. Then, the agent estimates the state change for each action as if it is selected and finally selects the most appropriate action. This enables the estimation of the state of the environment and the control of actions to reduce uncertainty within a single framework, even when information is uncertain. In this paper, to address the missing information in virtual space, we aim to appropriately engage sensing in the physical space by applying active inference to the search for individuals using multidirectional cameras and drones. The target of the search continues to move, making continuous sensing difficult and leading to missing information about the target. Therefore, when a multidirectional camera cannot sense the target, it estimates the target’s position and controls the capture range of other cameras and the movement direction of drones to more efficiently capture the target. Simulation results show that the time to capture the target is reduced compared to cases where active inference is not used.", "authors": [{"name": "Eito Kosuga", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "S.

{"title": "Interpretable Active Inference Gait Control Learning", "abstract": "Sustaining the gait locomotion in an adversarial environment requires the robot to react to novel experiences adaptively. In Free Energy Principle (FEP), the behavioral reaction is driven by the discrepancy between observation and prediction. Although, for legged robot gait locomotion, the prediction of gait dynamics is challenging as the consequences non-linearly depend on the activity history, the animal gait is robust, adapting to severe motion disruptions seemingly instantly. In biomimetic robotics, the Central Pattern Generator (CPG) relaxes the general dynamics of body-environment interaction to the stable and repetitive dynamics of gait. Based on these observations, we propose self-learning of the gait dynamics model and FEP framework that infers state estimation and gait control. The proposed method is experimentally evaluated on a real hexapod walking robot with 18 controllable degrees of freedom. The robot learns the gait dynamics model indoors and then deploys it in outdoor navigation under various adversarial scenarios. Results show that the developed interpretable gait controller exhibits complex and real-time adaptive behavior when it encounters unknown situations.", "authors": [{"name": "Rudolf J.

{"title": "A New Approach for Knowledge Generation Using Active Inference", "abstract": "There are various models proposed on how knowledge is generated in the human brain including the semantic networks model.

Given the importance of providing an appropriate model for knowledge generation, especially in the areas of improving human cognitive functions or building intelligent machines, improving existing models in knowledge generation or providing more comprehensive models is of great importance. In the current study, based on the free energy principle of the brain, is the researchers proposed a model for generating three types of declarative, procedural, and conditional knowledge. While explaining different types of knowledge, this model is capable to compute and generate concepts from stimuli based on probabilistic mathematics and the action-perception process (active inference). The proposed model is unsupervised learning that can update itself using a combination of different stimuli as a generative model can generate new concepts of unsupervised received stimuli. In this model, the active inference process is used in the generation of procedural and conditional knowledge and the perception process is used to generate declarative knowledge.", "authors": [{"name": "Jamshid Ghasimi", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Nazanin Movarraei", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2025, "doi": "10.48550/arXiv.2501.15105", "arxiv_id": "2501.15105", "s2_id": "e00ae6d0468c592199190deedf647991ecca3e67", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "arXiv.org", "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Decision-Making in Repeated Games: Insights from Active Inference", "abstract": "This review systematically explores the potential of the active inference framework in illuminating the cognitive mechanisms of decision-making in repeated games. Repeated games, characterized by multi-round interactions and social uncertainty, closely resemble real-world social scenarios in which the decision-making process involves interconnected cognitive components such as inference, policy selection, and learning. Unlike traditional reinforcement learning models, active inference, grounded in the principle of free energy minimization, unifies perception, learning, planning, and action within a single generative model. Belief updating occurs by minimizing variational free energy, while the exploration–exploitation dilemma is balanced by minimizing expected free energy. Based on partially observable Markov decision processes, the framework naturally incorporates social uncertainty, and its hierarchical structure allows for simulating mentalizing processes, providing a unified account of social decision-making.

{"title": "Decision, Inference, and Information: Formal Equivalences Under Active Inference", "abstract": "A central challenge in artificial intelligence and cognitive science is identifying a unifying principle that governs inference, learning, and action. Active inference proposes such a principle: the minimization of variational free energy. Advocates of active inference argue that the framework subsumes classical models of optimal behavior—including Bayesian decision theory, resource rationality, optimal control, and reinforcement learning—while also instantiating information-theoretic principles such as rate-distortion theory and maximum entropy. However, the literature outlining these conceptual links remains fragmented, limiting integration across fields. This review develops these connections systematically. We show how these major frameworks admit formal correspondences with expected free energy minimization when expressed in variational form, exposing a shared optimization principle that underlies theories of optimal decision-making and information processing. This synthesis is intended both to orient researchers from other fields who are new to active inference and to clarify foundational assumptions for those already working within the framework.", "authors": [{"name": "Patrick Sweeney", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Jaime Ruiz-Serra", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Michael S.

{"title": "Active Inference as a Model of Agency", "abstract": "Is there a canonical way to think of agency beyond reward maximisation? In this paper, we show that any type of behaviour complying with physically sound assumptions about how macroscopic biological agents interact with the world canonically integrates exploration and exploitation in the sense of minimising risk and ambiguity about states of the world. This description, known as active inference, refines the free energy principle, a popular descriptive framework for action and perception originating in neuroscience. Active inference provides a normative Bayesian framework to simulate and model agency that is widely used in behavioural neuroscience, reinforcement learning (RL) and robotics. The usefulness of active inference for RL is three-fold. \\emph{a}) Active inference provides a principled solution to the exploration-exploitation dilemma that usefully simulates biological agency. \\emph{b}) It provides an explainable recipe to simulate behaviour, whence behaviour follows as an explainable mixture of exploration and exploitation under a generative world model, and all differences in behaviour are explicit in differences in world model. \\emph{c}) This framework is universal in the sense that it is theoretically possible to rewrite any RL algorithm conforming to the descriptive assumptions of active inference as an active inference algorithm. Thus, active inference can be used as a tool to uncover and compare the commitments and assumptions of more specific models of agency.", "authors": [{"name": "Lancelot Da Costa", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Samuel Tenka", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Dominic Zhao", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Noor Sajid", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2024, "doi": "10.48550/arXiv.2401.12917", "arxiv_id": "2401.12917", "s2_id": "c6dbed0ad43956f87f41a03b0c7d784e649cb086", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "arXiv.org", "citation_count": 13, "references": ["s2:e5de43f98bfd367690e3787f130dadc02beb80dc", "s2:c3ce50ad15092d9a04a417fb3ff8ed2b9b710676", "s2:d21379c471254b9b8422734a84a41c39fafc4d24", "s2:e54427100b2de8187fe3b96303653b6220aaad44", "s2:d2d107630f062018ddc806798811cdb0e293ec78", "s2:8be55833180ec2d2fa3a0ad8f632a4e7aa2aa8d0", "s2:a290bb30af530ad5c1c74e065691129da3b3cb64", "s2:53050f73ceda37850bd4eecddf0abd79ace786fa", "s2:9baf20962a1bcbebd7d067f8e13ff182ef4ddc43", "s2:d825092cebfba0321e821d669e837fc03d5fb1f9", "s2:b449eddf2f994edf1b87bd5c8fc927d49391ab98", "s2:adc4df3c3c5bfaecb5510cf97da0d441938f5ab9", "s2:ddd19b377970ee3572610440509c0b09124870e0", "s2:2bad2462ad677851335bb9139813c4dcd391f5c2", "s2:a727b0d6fe97696da72be28725f47a2d3cdd09cd", "s2:2bda5d6f1f56403fcd5462297005f7d402bec966", "s2:1eecf3b4255909953a2a8973411ea47ce8d054a6", "s2:16aef42d9b453dad02a7aba750825bcb6e049bc1", "s2:bcded43798d767b76a86dbf8f568c7be85c480b4", "s2:e2128b0762bfd28125e55cab52a1ceb5435f8e9c", "s2:0ca7c0d92a10359a2a7b8fd501a40c9ef768676d", "s2:6be61525ee8b21c3bef6564df17b435fc4f84282", "s2:56ab6ccf2c0cda02660d79c104f5d29bce4312c0", "s2:d0984a8c32d25b5c4de1acf697b71613e5a1d6b8", "s2:67c6eb9de9aab00ee4e8da7c83a47899f0205ae8", "s2:d99028fbc40e0bb11b2c8e5a0d844d2ecfdeba4a", "s2:a934a3a7f171d494556a80d31f7bf4b637376c71", "s2:6043480abba84c0a339ad821369ad2148b0a4f56", "s2:270b95262f2100c279c4c65ef2521473841ca8ad", "s2:30cfa4ad8e94d5802280031ffc8da332f510b2bc", "s2:361e953f792a585496834ee14216b94d0ce9ae74", "s2:def8207fb6457f3c2656bac9f2bbf954de1d7de1", "s2:4aebc0c6dc90f27579b9a781588b13dead81de53", "s2:09806c3b252d1c26f69ce54214a6bd688f0e5f9c", "s2:ec38c924a5d188e9d1e38f608e910a9691859ece", "s2:83040001210751239553269727b9ea53e152af71", "s2:6ecc4b1ab05f3ec12484a0ea36abfd6271c5c5ba", "s2:bdba2d26e60a60a11738718e591e0bc5e6d9085e", "s2:dc8fb699df3504befcdf4037fb625d81f08a2876", "s2:b3daa22ab8f6ede403c8acf842fb8a427d3c1e62", "s2:5066e7e7bd0fd2735d6793dca8519bd024d90013", "s2:225ab689f41cef1dc18237ef5dab059a49950abf", "s2:6e90fd78e8a3b98af3954aae5209703aa966603e", "s2:e2f1df32b0809d9f81ccd0ca7a166847d3b52fb9", "s2:d85071fa91d57ab389043db37f4e22ff71b80d2d", "s2:afecfe9091d909647519d742ddff32b8b4235e82", "s2:1695ff30aa141088a019fc29df6d128d6add06f5", "s2:0bbba72496c1390dbb6cb2d4eba661f182971fe7", "s2:5df39cc393907ea78fddf461b494b4c5b1b5a2e4", "s2:33224ad0cdf6e2dc4893194dd587309c7887f0ba", "s2:1ed6a4a10589618d4f26350f1a296ee767ceff6b", "s2:7a7a23f2c39f9b1526bc8853c6c71a5b7f89e68c", "s2:9a25c8d370d5bae018706e92cd3b975e7ec737fd", "s2:1df88f9f0e599b79b1fef6d1bc8dd46271844a0a", "s2:e8077729ef723d71a0b7492f2f271ae413b5a4d5", "s2:641a9d87b9636d4ef2e353a569ddede68bd29131", "s2:a4d99468a565310c7396869b3b8db814d28f3576", "s2:aebd8bab5cff769fed204dba35112e364a47e504", "s2:2046412fecff64e095cc5190b69172055afd2094", "s2:2980dfe5c99658dc3e508d9d6e1d7f26e6fc8934", "s2:b26698a21c61a41f1997555b5cc0a93b42230f12", "s2:f5d4374d4a375afbee3979c0bd3eec60606cadbd", "s2:ff5ff13ba3155cb24d8ff88607b816f8174c6bad", "s2:6283173daff70b8426a02381d96995444fa55fa0", "s2:0fdd66fcf6b9bc04428e337df66fd510a659eb2f", "s2:f802d2f44fd6981e15342ab9f0afe1f74a8382c6", "s2:fbf449c368d0a873e9e5e28f313a67cf07b85dbd", "s2:089e80da8726a950d135f0a150889eff3fc04a99", "s2:2a65434d43ffa6554eaf14b728780919ad4f33eb", "s2:841bcfeea6611b40b8b10cb264450186ed65511a", "s2:255a77422b1da74da05d1714b7875356187385bd", "s2:97efafdb4a3942ab3efba53ded7413199f79c054", "s2:2af356314a5f2a77c23f9c3cc6f399baa6209b0f", "s2:1f462943c8d0af69c12a09058251848324135e5a", "s2:7362da1097866a805a1469cbc138983d3a7fb7b6", "s2:7ad8bf02e4828ae16a16f5ef829806c151273959", "s2:6fd04fb2f6408868a7103b78d4c464478af5a9be"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Real-World Robot Control Based on Contrastive Deep Active Inference With Demonstrations", "abstract": "Despite significant advances in robotics and deep learning, the ability of robots to perceive and act remain far below that of humans. To bridge this gap, we utilize active inference, a framework based on the free-energy principle that accounts for various human brain functions. Despite the utility of active inference, most previous studies have focused on simulated or real-world environments with low-dimensional observations. Therefore, direct applications in real-world robotics with high-dimensional observation and action spaces remain a challenge. To address this issue, we combine the active inference framework with contrastive learning and develop an extension by introducing learning from demonstration. This framework comprises a world model, an action model, and an expected free-energy model. The world model ensures an adequate perception of the environment by minimizing contrastive variational free energy. Meanwhile, the expected free-energy model estimates the contrastive expected free energy, while the action model generates adaptive actions by learning from demonstrations, with the aim of minimizing the estimates provided by the expected free-energy model. We show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework through image-based robotic reaching tasks in both learned and unlearned real-world environments. As a result, while the baselines achieved a success rate of up to approximately 71%, the proposed framework achieved a success rate of around 96%. Moreover, the proposed framework realized performance improvements by leveraging estimated expected free energy for action selection. These results highlight the utility of active inference with contrastive learning and learning from demonstration for real-world robot control.", "authors": [{"name": "Kentaro Fujii", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Takuya Isomura", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Shingo Murata", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2024, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3477306", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": "ec97d1c8f9f5ce60c86fcdb511861df3928ad4b3", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "IEEE Access", "citation_count": 3, "references": ["s2:83f7d0960f29c6c13a12ffac249ebc40fcb171da", "s2:dc0064ec5cb45322a4e07af1458747a880269a9c", "s2:073a968f1b0ec171c1af945834260986c6451f5d", "s2:e2d773b4d2f8bc1c9b35324bdbe43455a7c43559", "s2:a68db57f08f6d72c0d3b22d451d2606dca880f94", "s2:f63adcba79ab09c2eed7d22174661be98a018bf4", "s2:51742dadd56e4703a2dce60add6c3181f2e7644d", "s2:fd1cf28a2b8caf2fe29af5e7fa9191cecfedf84d", "s2:0e34addae55a571d7efd3a5e2543e86dd7d41a83", "s2:05c4bfd0b16fd0ab0e72e0866d0a5bfec5ad7ded", "s2:979810ca765695a481c37126103b8ba256ee2192", "s2:25bc06b508b2c63b9faf77881e528530b147b988", "s2:a8f929c88dbb8f387443af18b51baf642efa8b66", "s2:523acd658742fb9c978e3f7638c09d7ce78af719", "s2:4638833430905ccead0ee73e80256d081d23ff7f", "s2:6525e8db085289c8ad85640a7f9343f626cac951", "s2:65cdf555805f22ab3f1170147f841b3c4f2790bd", "s2:1d803f07e4591bd67c358eef715bcd443e821894", "s2:5f4f196fc6277185d85816501bb814dfaeed69e4", "s2:d825092cebfba0321e821d669e837fc03d5fb1f9", "s2:9479ced8f325fdd53b8fc2ea5ca0a1d0be9c4ed1", "s2:19dc9ce9a42bd254a354bc6f3470693129e61101", "s2:5c74b1021aebd0575c339ce4dfd47e183009a9c5", "s2:05c01bb3f9c1ab23ff56f8e4b53f89300298b82b", "s2:adc4df3c3c5bfaecb5510cf97da0d441938f5ab9", "s2:ddd19b377970ee3572610440509c0b09124870e0", "s2:907c709344583b9db16c20875dc5dd30ab2b2a38", "s2:778349c7a1702f16586a0a2fed2840862c9100d5", "s2:5d556dd3afff529de8cb694f88916b2d95fbdd3a", "s2:2197f3c2270f267e5e37d0e3e51979d1304cf9dd", "s2:16aef42d9b453dad02a7aba750825bcb6e049bc1", "s2:02f3c052a9cf675a6f033eac56c9dacb0a10ea28", "s2:b44bb1762640ed72091fd5f5fdc20719a6dc24af", "s2:931781af3b6797d5abe3aa2537f4f46fd4fdf3ef", "s2:87821f5fd000d873beb5ba55689ba90def31a8c1", "s2:d0984a8c32d25b5c4de1acf697b71613e5a1d6b8", "s2:38f93092ece8eee9771e61c1edaf11b1293cae1b", "s2:67c6eb9de9aab00ee4e8da7c83a47899f0205ae8", "s2:f441e637980a8b427474dbdc0141f38dd78bb831", "s2:9efb64f20ab1f157ca9f4050d4aaacf6c3f9b2b2", "s2:bbac680797af0f7ce4cdcc6430ff001fa0dfe670", "s2:7af72a461ed7cda180e7eab878efd5f35d79bbf4", "s2:def8207fb6457f3c2656bac9f2bbf954de1d7de1", "s2:123c4570902a5202a4fb49e9d0b3feeb3b4ef86e", "s2:99a7df93a2e16bd7ac3349d52cc34417cda7909d", "s2:fea3e63c97c7292dc6fbcb3ffe7131eb54053986", "s2:09806c3b252d1c26f69ce54214a6bd688f0e5f9c", "s2:b227f3e4c0dc96e5ac5426b85485a70f2175a205", "s2:6ecc4b1ab05f3ec12484a0ea36abfd6271c5c5ba", "s2:ff332c21562c87cab5891d495b7d0956f2d9228b", "s2:d316c82c12cf4c45f9e85211ef3d1fa62497bff8", "s2:57620e357ee348cd5ffa8eafa480e002a2aba06a", "s2:ac3ee98020251797c2b401e1389461df88e52e62", "s2:1eb09fecd75eb27825dce4f964b97f4f5cc399d7", "s2:62c76ca0b2790c34e85ba1cce09d47be317c7235", "s2:e3ce36b9deb47aa6bb2aa19c4bfa71283b505025", "s2:1ed6a4a10589618d4f26350f1a296ee767ceff6b", "s2:b11caa1dc4f418c0df00022fe81e889e5ad03995", "s2:cfae974c483d6e9624c767389eeb2b54e0925e96", "s2:cdb48a96036b8cd2367eea596cff2db828305150", "s2:e5c181d1517055f9fbae41c3517cf85a42aca677", "s2:ef4f5a50837a7c1b3e87b9300ffc7ba00d461a0f", "s2:0fdd66fcf6b9bc04428e337df66fd510a659eb2f"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Active Inference for Self-Organizing Multi-LLM Systems: A Bayesian Thermodynamic Approach to Adaptation", "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel approach to creating adaptive language agents by integrating active inference with large language models (LLMs). While LLMs demonstrate remarkable capabilities, their reliance on static prompts limits adaptation to new information and changing environments. We address this by implementing an active inference framework that acts as a cognitive layer above an LLM-based agent, dynamically adjusting prompts and search strategies through principled information-seeking behavior. Our framework models the environment using three state factors (prompt, search, and information states) with seven observation modalities capturing quality metrics. By framing the agent's learning through the free energy principle, we enable systematic exploration of prompt combinations and search strategies. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, with the agent developing accurate models of environment dynamics evidenced by emergent structure in observation matrices. Action selection patterns reveal sophisticated exploration-exploitation behavior, transitioning from initial information-gathering to targeted prompt testing. The integration of thermodynamic principles with language model capabilities provides a principled framework for creating robust, adaptable agents, extending active inference beyond traditional low-dimensional control problems to high-dimensional, language-driven environments.", "authors": [{"name": "Rithvik Prakki", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2024, "doi": "10.48550/arXiv.2412.10425", "arxiv_id": "2412.10425", "s2_id": "da803b3c9c2f605fc29fee6fddd66e2e20ec862d", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "arXiv.org", "citation_count": 1, "references": ["s2:bde841b0dbbf7a15ee69966a828c7fe2cf532ad9", "s2:21b302436c50d25f936828092b266c1fdcad8914", "s2:ea750468ca11428fc8515ac3b2227e5d297f2fb6", "s2:bae5e043025a6856637bdf6ebda2a6ac6c2ece30", "s2:6c17de3e719c0f4d1df6a16f770c2a9a5f18206f", "s2:88853bbd0878637c1bf02a9f1e4ce3acc151bed1", "s2:a173b47ee90fb18948d70126f4d40b5561b7d932", "s2:f197bf0fc2f228483f6af3285000d54d8d97f9eb", "s2:c5919327d94883e86d1c24b055c341f6640bfc17", "s2:99ca5162211a895a5dfbff9d7e36e21e09ca646e", "s2:d766bffc357127e0dc86dd69561d5aeb520d6f4c", "s2:998628588f7850d533a172c883872057a9198d82", "s2:16aef42d9b453dad02a7aba750825bcb6e049bc1", "s2:4d21334ea3564c89586e1ba176e11382bdd3d394", "s2:1c167b1ce9928d46259937bb13dbc2c6ef7aed8f", "s2:dc8fb699df3504befcdf4037fb625d81f08a2876", "s2:754b657330b1674d3453e8254d3a664db5222b3b", "s2:5e07da2914783a21980ecc1cea688d1333e6b6e4", "s2:da3e4a8ad14b66c60e838def7ad4ed656190969b"], "publication_date": null}

Initially, we offer a concise introduction to active inference, emphasizing its relevance to modeling decision-making, introspection, and the generation of both overt and covert actions. Subsequently, we delve into how active inference can serve as a foundation for designing explainable AI systems. Specifically, it enables us to capture essential aspects of \"introspective\" processes and generate intelligible models of decision-making mechanisms. We propose an architectural framework for explainable AI systems employing active inference. Central to this framework is an explicit hierarchical generative model that enables the AI system to monitor and elucidate the factors influencing its decisions. Importantly, this model's structure is designed to be understandable and verifiable by human users. We elucidate how this architecture can amalgamate diverse data sources to make informed decisions in a transparent manner, mirroring aspects of human consciousness and introspection. Finally, we examine the implications of our findings for future AI research and discuss potential ethical considerations associated with developing AI systems with (apparent) introspective capabilities.", "authors": [{"name": "José Gabriel Carrasco Ramírez", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2024, "doi": "10.60087/jaigs.vol4.issue1.p26", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": "dda94f6c6e4f6b08c2bf06b953f633e4fa183132", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "Journal of Artificial Intelligence General science (JAIGS) ISSN:3006-4023", "citation_count": 1, "references": [], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Distributed Beamforming by Multi-Agent Active Inference", "abstract": "Massive MIMO systems have emerged as a promising technology for next-generation wireless communication networks. Beamforming, a key technique in Massive MIMO, significantly enhances the system's performance by exploiting the spatial domain. This paper presents a collaborative beamforming approach that leverages vertical collaboration between base stations to improve adaptation and mitigate fading variations, while also applying the principle of free energy to optimize beamforming. The approach involves sharing estimated channel states and learned models among base stations, enabling them to collectively optimize beamforming based on the principle of free energy. Evaluations in single-user operation scenarios demonstrate that both with and without vertical collaboration, the expected free energy, representing beamforming performance, decreases over time. However, vertical collaboration reduces temporary decreases in signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) caused by independent adaptation to fading variations. Furthermore, in a multi-user switching scenario, the proposed approach ensures stable control by utilizing learned models and state estimation results, leading to improved beamforming performance during switching.", "authors": [{"name": "Tatsuya Otoshi", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Masayuki Murata", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2024, "doi": "10.1109/ICNC59896.2024.10556169", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": "e750e6e8e6f3ed3fc53a4d451a2e368dd46ffdef", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "International Conference on Computing, Networking and Communications", "citation_count": 1, "references": [], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Boosting MCTS with Free Energy Minimization", "abstract": "Active inference, grounded in the free energy principle, provides a powerful lens for understanding how agents balance exploration and goal-directed behavior in uncertain environments. Here, we propose a new planning framework that integrates Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) with active inference objectives to systematically reduce epistemic uncertainty while pursuing extrinsic rewards. Our key insight is that MCTS, already renowned for its search efficiency, can be naturally extended to incorporate free energy minimization by blending expected rewards with information gain. Concretely, the cross-entropy method (CEM) is used to optimize action proposals at the root node, while tree expansions leverage reward modeling alongside intrinsic exploration bonuses. This synergy allows our planner to maintain coherent estimates of value and uncertainty throughout planning, without sacrificing computational tractability. Empirically, we benchmark our planner on a diverse set of continuous control tasks, where it demonstrates performance gains over both stand-alone CEM and MCTS with random rollouts.", "authors": [{"name": "M.

{"title": "Logic, morality and free energy minimization", "abstract": "The paper presents research on morality and logic as social-communicative phenomena attempting to explicate them basing on the Free Energy Principle (FEP), Predictive Pro­cessing (PP), and Active Inference (ACI). These frameworks, rooted in statistical ther­modynamics, computational neuroscience and theoretical biology, provide a thought-pro­voking viewpoint for understanding how humans and other living or artificial systems may navigate complex social, intellectual and moral environments by minimizing uncer­tainty and optimizing their models of the world. According to the view presented hereto, a society’s generative model is a distributed, emergent structure enacted through the pre­dictive activities of its agents’ brains. This model maintains non-equilibrium stability of the social whole by self-evidencing – agents are urged to act as to confirm the society’s existence as a coherent entity (e.g., through rituals, laws, or moral codes). This distri­buted generative model (DGM) induces some counter-utilitarian beliefs (e.g., loyalty over personal gain), which are embedded as priors to bias agents toward bond-main­taining behaviors, ensuring the system’s integrity over time. This process is both adaptive (evolutionary) and normative (cultural), aligning with FEP’s claim that systems persist by minimizing free energy across scales.", "authors": [{"name": "I.

{"title": "Designing explainable artificial intelligence with active inference: A framework for transparent introspection and decision-making", "abstract": "This paper investigates the prospect of developing human-interpretable, explainable artificial intelligence (AI) systems based on active inference and the free energy principle. We first provide a brief overview of active inference, and in particular, of how it applies to the modeling of decision-making, introspection, as well as the generation of overt and covert actions. We then discuss how active inference can be leveraged to design explainable AI systems, namely, by allowing us to model core features of ``introspective'' processes and by generating useful, human-interpretable models of the processes involved in decision-making. We propose an architecture for explainable AI systems using active inference. This architecture foregrounds the role of an explicit hierarchical generative model, the operation of which enables the AI system to track and explain the factors that contribute to its own decisions, and whose structure is designed to be interpretable and auditable by human users. We outline how this architecture can integrate diverse sources of information to make informed decisions in an auditable manner, mimicking or reproducing aspects of human-like consciousness and introspection. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for future research in AI, and the potential ethical considerations of developing AI systems with (the appearance of) introspective capabilities.", "authors": [{"name": "Mahault Albarracin", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Ines Hip'olito", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Safae Essafi Tremblay", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Jason G.

{"title": "Control Flow in Active Inference Systems—Part I: Classical and Quantum Formulations of Active Inference", "abstract": "Living systems face both environmental complexity and limited access to free-energy resources. Survival under these conditions requires a control system that can activate, or deploy, available perception and action resources in a context specific way. In this Part I, we introduce the free-energy principle (FEP) and the idea of active inference as Bayesian prediction-error minimization, and show how the control problem arises in active inference systems. We then review classical and quantum formulations of the FEP, with the former being the classical limit of the latter. In the accompanying Part II, we show that when systems are described as executing active inference driven by the FEP, their control flow systems can always be represented as tensor networks (TNs). We show how TNs as control systems can be implemented within the general framework of quantum topological neural networks, and discuss the implications of these results for modeling biological systems at multiple scales.", "authors": [{"name": "C.

{"title": "Active Inference and Intentional Behaviour", "abstract": "Recent advances in theoretical biology suggest that basal cognition and sentient behaviour are emergent properties of in vitro cell cultures and neuronal networks, respectively. Such neuronal networks spontaneously learn structured behaviours in the absence of reward or reinforcement. In this paper, we characterise this kind of self-organisation through the lens of the free energy principle, i.e., as self-evidencing. We do this by first discussing the definitions of reactive and sentient behaviour in the setting of active inference, which describes the behaviour of agents that model the consequences of their actions. We then introduce a formal account of intentional behaviour, that describes agents as driven by a preferred endpoint or goal in latent state-spaces. We then investigate these forms of (reactive, sentient, and intentional) behaviour using simulations. First, we simulate the aforementioned in vitro experiments, in which neuronal cultures spontaneously learn to play Pong, by implementing nested, free energy minimising processes. The simulations are then used to deconstruct the ensuing predictive behaviour, leading to the distinction between merely reactive, sentient, and intentional behaviour, with the latter formalised in terms of inductive planning. This distinction is further studied using simple machine learning benchmarks (navigation in a grid world and the Tower of Hanoi problem), that show how quickly and efficiently adaptive behaviour emerges under an inductive form of active inference.", "authors": [{"name": "Karl J.

{"title": "Control Flow in Active Inference Systems—Part II: Tensor Networks as General Models of Control Flow", "abstract": "Living systems face both environmental complexity and limited access to free-energy resources. Survival under these conditions requires a control system that can activate, or deploy, available perception and action resources in a context specific way. In Part I, we introduced the free-energy principle (FEP) and the idea of active inference as Bayesian prediction-error minimization, and show how the control problem arises in active inference systems. We then review classical and quantum formulations of the FEP, with the former being the classical limit of the latter. In this accompanying Part II, we show that when systems are described as executing active inference driven by the FEP, their control flow systems can always be represented as tensor networks (TNs). We show how TNs as control systems can be implemented within the general framework of quantum topological neural networks, and discuss the implications of these results for modeling biological systems at multiple scales.", "authors": [{"name": "C.

{"title": "Realising Synthetic Active Inference Agents, Part I: Epistemic Objectives and Graphical Specification Language", "abstract": "The Free Energy Principle (FEP) is a theoretical framework for describing how (intelligent) systems self-organise into coherent, stable structures by minimising a free energy functional. Active Inference (AIF) is a corollary of the FEP that specifically details how systems that are able to plan for the future (agents) function by minimising particular free energy functionals that incorporate information seeking components. This paper is the first in a series of two where we derive a synthetic version of AIF on free form factor graphs. The present paper focuses on deriving a local version of the free energy functionals used for AIF. This enables us to construct a version of AIF which applies to arbitrary graphical models and interfaces with prior work on message passing algorithms. The resulting messages are derived in our companion paper. We also identify a gap in the graphical notation used for factor graphs. While factor graphs are great at expressing a generative model, they have so far been unable to specify the full optimisation problem including constraints. To solve this problem we develop Constrained Forney-style Factor Graph (CFFG) notation which permits a fully graphical description of variational inference objectives. We then proceed to show how CFFG's can be used to reconstruct prior algorithms for AIF as well as derive new ones. The latter is demonstrated by deriving an algorithm that permits direct policy inference for AIF agents, circumventing a long standing scaling issue that has so far hindered the application of AIF in industrial settings. We demonstrate our algorithm on the classic T-maze task and show that it reproduces the information seeking behaviour that is a hallmark feature of AIF.", "authors": [{"name": "Magnus T.

{"title": "Active Inference for Autonomous Decision-Making with Contextual Multi-Armed Bandits", "abstract": "In autonomous robotic decision-making under uncertainty, the tradeoff between exploitation and exploration of available options must be considered. If secondary information associated with options can be utilized, such decision-making problems can often be formulated as contextual multi-armed bandits (CMABs). In this study, we apply active inference, which has been actively studied in the field of neuroscience in recent years, as an alternative action selection strategy for CMABs. Unlike conventional action selection strategies, it is possible to rigorously evaluate the uncertainty of each option when calculating the expected free energy (EFE) associated with the decision agent's probabilistic model, as derived from the free-energy principle. We specifically address the case where a categorical observation likelihood function is used, such that EFE values are analytically intractable. We introduce new approximation methods for computing the EFE based on variational and Laplace approximations. Extensive simulation study results demonstrate that, compared to other strategies, active inference generally requires far fewer iterations to identify optimal options and generally achieves superior cumulative regret, for relatively low extra computational cost.", "authors": [{"name": "Shohei Wakayama", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "N.

{"title": "Predictive coding, active inference and the brain: An evolutionary perspective", "abstract": "In 1963, Niko Tinbergen proposed that the phylogeny of behavior was one of the foremost questions to be addressed by behavioral research: We have to understand the evolution of the species we are researching – in our case, the human being – if we are to understand and explain the behavior. In this context, the latest issue of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B is of interest to neuropsychoanalysis, as its subject is systems neuroscience through the lens of evolutionary theory. All articles are interesting and more or less relevant to readers of all kinds, but one needs special mention in this journal: the article by Pezzulo, Parr and Friston on the evolution of brain architectures for predictive coding and active inference. Or, to reformulate in the words of Tinbergen: the phylogeny of the brainmind as executor of the free-energy principle, well known to the readers of this journal. Their article considers the evolution of brain architectures for predictive processing, arguing that brainmechanisms for predictive perception and action are not late evolutionary additions in advanced creatures like us. Rather, they emerged gradually from simpler predictive loops (e.g. autonomic and motor reflexes) that were a legacy from our earlier evolutionary ancestors – and were key to solving their fundamental problems of adaptive regulation. Simpler-to-more-complex brains are characterized formally, in terms of generative models that include predictive loops of increasing hierarchical breadth and depth. These may start from a simple homeostatic motif and be elaborated during evolution in four main ways:", "authors": [{"name": "H.

{"title": "Active inference body perception and action for humanoid robots", "abstract": "One of the biggest challenges in robotics systems is interacting under uncertainty. Unlike robots, humans learn, adapt and perceive their body as a unity when interacting with the world. We hypothesize that the nervous system counteracts sensor and motor uncertainties by unconscious processes that robustly fuse the available information for approximating their body and the world state. Being able to unite perception and action under a common principle has been sought for decades and active inference is one of the potential unification theories. In this work, we present a humanoid robot interacting with the world by means of a human brain-like inspired perception and control algorithm based on the free-energy principle. Until now, active inference was only tested in simulated examples. Their application on a real robot shows the advantages of such an algorithm for real world applications. The humanoid robot iCub was capable of performing robust reaching behaviors with both arms and active head object tracking in the visual field, despite the visual noise, the artificially introduced noise in the joint encoders (up to 40 degrees deviation), the differences between the model and the real robot and the misdetections of the hand.", "authors": [{"name": "G.

This allows us to understand resilience as the self-maintenance of a non-equilibrium steady-state. This autopoietic steady-state depends on gradient flows that counter entropic dissipation by random fluctuations. These flows can also be interpreted in a statistical sense, which amounts to the claim that resilience depends upon the Earth system possessing a Markov blanket were blanket states (i.e., active and sensory states) separate internal states from external states. Our formalization rests on how the metabolic rates of the biosphere (i.e., internal states) relate vicariously to solar radiation at the Earth&#8217;s surface (i.e., external states), through the changes in greenhouse and albedo effects (i.e. active states) and ocean-driven global temperature changes (i.e. sensory states). Describing the interaction between the metabolic rates and solar radiation as climatic states&#8212;via a Markov blanket&#8212;amounts to describing the dynamics of the internal states as actively inferring external states.

{"title": "Active Inference and Cognitive Consistency", "abstract": "I know little about social psychology and less about cognitive consistency theory; however, I greatly enjoyed reading the deconstruction of this paradigm by Kruglanski et al. (this issue). I learned a lot and was struck repeatedly by the consilience between their treatment and complementary formulations in theoretical neurobiology. The underlying tenets of their argument emerge—in my world—from a Bayesian or variational treatment of perception and self-organized behavior. This is variously known as the free energy principle, active inference, predictive processing, or self-evidencing (Clark, 2013, Friston, 2010; Friston, FitzGerald, Rigoli, Schwartenbeck, & Pezzulo, 2017; Hohwy, 2016). Particular flavors of this formulation have dominated cognitive neuroscience and aspects of philosophy for the past decade. For example, the Bayesian brain hypothesis (Kersten, Mamassian, & Yuille, 2004; Knill & Pouget, 2004) and predictive processing (Barrett & Simmons, 2015; Michael & De Bruin, 2015; Rao & Ballard 1999; Seth, 2013) are now predominant paradigms in cognitive neuroscience. Active inference generalizes this approach to provide an enactive or embodied treatment of action and perception. This resulting treatment bears some remarkable similarities to the ideas reviewed in Kruglanski et al. This commentary tries to establish the formal links between active inference and constructs in cognitive consistency theory in the hope that there may be some useful cross-fertilisation. In what follows, I briefly overview active inference with a special focus on the quantities needed to describe affective responses to new information and then unpack some key dialectics that speak to cognitive consistency, epistemic and motivational value, specific and nonspecific closure, and so on.", "authors": [{"name": "Karl J.

{"title": "Retrospective surprise: A computational component for active inference", "abstract": "In the free energy principle (FEP), proposed by Friston, it is supposed that agents seek to minimize the “surprise”–the negative log (marginal) likelihood of observations (i.e., sensory stimuli)–given the agents' current belief. This is achieved by minimizing the free energy, which provides an upper bound on the surprise. The FEP has been applied to action selection in a framework called “active inference,” where agents are supposed to select an action so that they minimize the “expected free energy” (EFE). While the FEP and active inference have attracted the attention of researchers in a wide range of fields such as psychology and psychiatry, as well as neuroscience, it is not clear which psychological construct EFE is related to. To facilitate the discussion and interpretation of psychological processes underlying active inference, we introduce a computational component termed the “retrospective (or residual) surprise,” which is the surprise of an observation after updating the belief given the observation itself. We show that the predicted retrospective surprise (PRS) provides a lower bound on EFE: EFE is always larger than PRS. We illustrate the properties of EFE and PRS using examples of inference for a binary hidden cause given a binary observation. Essentially, EFE and PRS show similar behavior; however, in certain situations, they provide different predictions regarding action selection. This study also provides insights into the mechanism of active inference based on EFE.", "authors": [{"name": "K.

{"title": "Bridging Probabilistic Inference and Behavior Trees: An Interactive Framework for Adaptive Multi-Robot Cooperation", "abstract": "This paper proposes an Interactive Inference Behavior Tree (IIBT) framework that integrates behavior trees (BTs) with active inference under the free energy principle for distributed multi-robot decision-making. The proposed IIBT node extends conventional BTs with probabilistic reasoning, enabling online joint planning and execution across multiple robots. It remains fully compatible with standard BT architectures, allowing seamless integration into existing multi-robot control systems. Within this framework, multi-robot cooperation is formulated as a free-energy minimization process, where each robot dynamically updates its preference matrix based on perceptual inputs and peer intentions, thereby achieving adaptive coordination in partially observable and dynamic environments. The proposed approach is validated through both simulation and real-world experiments, including a multi-robot maze navigation and a collaborative manipulation task, compared against traditional BTs(https://youtu.be/KX_oT3IDTf4). Experimental results demonstrate that the IIBT framework reduces BT node complexity by over 70%, while maintaining robust, interpretable, and adaptive cooperative behavior under environmental uncertainty.", "authors": [{"name": "Chaoran Wang", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Jingyuan Sun", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Yanhui Zhang", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "C.

Through electrophysiological stimulation and recording, cultures were embedded in a simulated game-world, mimicking the arcade game ‘Pong’. Applying a previously untestable theory of active inference via the Free Energy Principle, we found that learning was apparent within five minutes of real-time gameplay, not observed in control conditions. Further experiments demonstrate the importance of closed-loop structured feedback in eliciting learning over time.

{"title": "Universal AI maximizes Variational Empowerment", "abstract": "This paper presents a theoretical framework unifying AIXI -- a model of universal AI -- with variational empowerment as an intrinsic drive for exploration. We build on the existing framework of Self-AIXI -- a universal learning agent that predicts its own actions -- by showing how one of its established terms can be interpreted as a variational empowerment objective. We further demonstrate that universal AI's planning process can be cast as minimizing expected variational free energy (the core principle of active Inference), thereby revealing how universal AI agents inherently balance goal-directed behavior with uncertainty reduction curiosity). Moreover, we argue that power-seeking tendencies of universal AI agents can be explained not only as an instrumental strategy to secure future reward, but also as a direct consequence of empowerment maximization -- i.e. the agent's intrinsic drive to maintain or expand its own controllability in uncertain environments. Our main contribution is to show how these intrinsic motivations (empowerment, curiosity) systematically lead universal AI agents to seek and sustain high-optionality states. We prove that Self-AIXI asymptotically converges to the same performance as AIXI under suitable conditions, and highlight that its power-seeking behavior emerges naturally from both reward maximization and curiosity-driven exploration. Since AIXI can be view as a Bayes-optimal mathematical formulation for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), our result can be useful for further discussion on AI safety and the controllability of AGI.", "authors": [{"name": "Yusuke Hayashi", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Koichi Takahashi", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2025, "doi": "10.48550/arXiv.2502.15820", "arxiv_id": "2502.15820", "s2_id": "83a28f61b009c58286bfefb3acbc51ab206cefdd", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "Artificial General Intelligence", "citation_count": 1, "references": ["s2:46d4452eb041e33f1e58eab64ec8cf5af534b6ff", "s2:a44cf961a4495f5a789dfa240e2675f7fffa615e", "s2:e0fe9b2f77288bc5e6f778611a49e62e98231f8c", "s2:afb42208cc499ede10a65af0dbe598e08556370d", "s2:ab68ddbdd8d0b61d9f9c8fa500a4c13d06158060", "s2:e3069e95026378d344e22766adac10490b053078", "s2:1ed6a4a10589618d4f26350f1a296ee767ceff6b", "s2:6cc0699a4a99132b7aecddb7f2e37d731e36bb43", "s2:787d7e78036a2951b0781dbcda837e2fa019164e", "s2:4b3439884c4dbac5fc5530ab5afeaf3669e85462"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Equilibrium-Driven Antifragility in Computing Continuum Systems", "abstract": "In this article, we propose a novel framework inspired by neuroscience to define and maintain equilibrium in computing continuum systems (CCSs). To do so, we conceptualize equilibrium not as a static state but as a dynamic condition of predictive regulation that supports resilience and adaptation. Our methodology quantifies distance from equilibrium by modeling system behavior using Bayesian networks and computing Kullback–Leibler divergence between expected and observed system states under perturbation. Conceptually, this approach is grounded in the Fluctuation–Dissipation Theorem, which describes how a system’s internal variability predicts its response to external changes. While this is a conceptual article without empirical implementation, it provides a principled foundation based on the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and active inference for future research aimed at managing and potentially designing CCSs that are not only resilient but also antifragile, capable of learning from disruptions to improve their performance over time.", "authors": [{"name": "Nefeli-Marina Rouska", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Víctor Casamayor-Pujol", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Ildefons Magrans de Abril", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "S.

{"title": "What is mood? A computational perspective", "abstract": "Abstract The neurobiological understanding of mood, and by extension mood disorders, remains elusive despite decades of research implicating several neuromodulator systems. This review considers a new approach based on existing theories of functional brain organisation. The free energy principle (a.k.a. active inference), and its instantiation in the Bayesian brain, offers a complete and simple formulation of mood. It has been proposed that emotions reflect the precision of – or certainty about – the predicted sensorimotor/interoceptive consequences of action. By extending this reasoning, in a hierarchical setting, we suggest mood states act as (hyper) priors over uncertainty (i.e. emotions). Here, we consider the same computational pathology in the proprioceptive and interoceptive (behavioural and autonomic) domain in order to furnish an explanation for mood disorders.

{"title": "The Emperor's New Markov Blankets", "abstract": "Abstract The free energy principle, an influential framework in computational neuroscience and theoretical neurobiology, starts from the assumption that living systems ensure adaptive exchanges with their environment by minimizing the objective function of variational free energy. Following this premise, it claims to deliver a promising integration of the life sciences. In recent work, Markov blankets, one of the central constructs of the free energy principle, have been applied to resolve debates central to philosophy (such as demarcating the boundaries of the mind). The aim of this paper is twofold. First, we trace the development of Markov blankets starting from their standard application in Bayesian networks, via variational inference, to their use in the literature on active inference. We then identify a persistent confusion in the literature between the formal use of Markov blankets as an epistemic tool for Bayesian inference, and their novel metaphysical use in the free energy framework to demarcate the physical boundary between an agent and its environment. Consequently, we propose to distinguish between “Pearl blankets” to refer to the original epistemic use of Markov blankets and “Friston blankets” to refer to the new metaphysical construct. Second, we use this distinction to critically assess claims resting on the application of Markov blankets to philosophical problems. We suggest that this literature would do well in differentiating between two different research programmes: “inference with a model” and “inference within a model.” Only the latter is capable of doing metaphysical work with Markov blankets, but requires additional philosophical premises and cannot be justified by an appeal to the success of the mathematical framework alone.", "authors": [{"name": "J.

{"title": "Development of Compositionality and Generalization through Interactive Learning of Language and Action of Robots", "abstract": "Humans excel at applying learned behavior to unlearned situations. A crucial component of this generalization behavior is our ability to compose/decompose a whole into reusable parts, an attribute known as compositionality. One of the fundamental questions in robotics concerns this characteristic.\"How can linguistic compositionality be developed concomitantly with sensorimotor skills through associative learning, particularly when individuals only learn partial linguistic compositions and their corresponding sensorimotor patterns?\"To address this question, we propose a brain-inspired neural network model that integrates vision, proprioception, and language into a framework of predictive coding and active inference, based on the free-energy principle. The effectiveness and capabilities of this model were assessed through various simulation experiments conducted with a robot arm. Our results show that generalization in learning to unlearned verb-noun compositions, is significantly enhanced when training variations of task composition are increased. We attribute this to self-organized compositional structures in linguistic latent state space being influenced significantly by sensorimotor learning. Ablation studies show that visual attention and working memory are essential to accurately generate visuo-motor sequences to achieve linguistically represented goals. These insights advance our understanding of mechanisms underlying development of compositionality through interactions of linguistic and sensorimotor experience.", "authors": [{"name": "Prasanna Vijayaraghavan", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "J.

{"title": "A Philosophical Study of the Internalization of Natural Rationality and the Origin of Mental Causation", "abstract": "Abstract Action is not just behavior. Without beliefs, desires, and intentions as reasons, action cannot be considered action. This is the central idea of the contemporary philosophy of action. But where does the root lie in explaining action by the reasons of belief, desire, and intention? What is the fundamental difference between mental causal states and the brain’s neural-dynamic causal states as reasons for action? The literature of philosophy of mind offers various perspectives on these questions. The active inference theory, centered on the free energy principle (FEP), provides new resources for explaining mental causation in animals and humans. The physical explanation of action is limited to efficient causal explanations, while the intentional mental causation emphasized by Davidson and Searle is precisely the internalization of natural teleological causation in animals and humans. This internalization follows the FEP of self-organizing systems; it has evolved through long and complex evolutionary game processes. FEP is not only a telelolgical principle, but also the law of nature that provides the foundation for intentional explanations of action. The active inference that emerges through natural competition and selection follows a second-order natural law, FEP, providing a natural mechanism for resolving mind-body problems such as anomalous monism.", "authors": [{"name": "Chuang Liu", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2024, "doi": "10.1080/02529203.2024.2428563", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": "eb2728151880eaa2d9b5a6e203ca277175e76e9f", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "Social Sciences in China", "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Empirical Translation Process Research: Past and Possible Future Perspectives", "abstract": "\n Over the last four decades, considerable efforts have been devoted to the modeling and evaluation of human\n translation processes. This article takes a closer look at the evolution of empirical Translation Process Research (TPR) within\n the CRITT TPR-DB tradition.

{"title": "Brain in the Dark: Design Principles for Neuromimetic Inference under the Free Energy Principle", "abstract": "Deep learning has revolutionised artificial intelligence (AI) by enabling automatic feature extraction and function approximation from raw data. However, it faces challenges such as a lack of out-of-distribution generalisation, catastrophic forgetting and poor interpretability. In contrast, biological neural networks, such as those in the human brain, do not suffer from these issues, inspiring AI researchers to explore neuromimetic deep learning, which aims to replicate brain mechanisms within AI models. A foundational theory for this approach is the Free Energy Principle (FEP), which despite its potential, is often considered too complex to understand and implement in AI as it requires an interdisciplinary understanding across a variety of fields. This paper seeks to demystify the FEP and provide a comprehensive framework for designing neuromimetic models with human-like perception capabilities. We present a roadmap for implementing these models and a Pytorch code repository for applying FEP in a predictive coding network.", "authors": [{"name": "Mehran H.

{"title": "Effect of Robot’s Active Behavior using Free Energy Principle on Perception of Agency*", "abstract": "The hypothesis that a robot’s active behavior improves people’s perception of agency toward the robot is examined through observation of interactions between human participants and a real robot and through questionnaires. Because of the cute appearance and childlike behavior of social robots, people have conventionally felt that the robots rely on people. In order for robots to be introduced into more situations, such as caregiving, it is also necessary for people to feel that they can rely on robots. The key to making people feel that they can rely on robots is to improve their perception of agency toward the robot. Humans are generally considered to have agency, and they behave actively based on their motivation to achieve certain goals. If a robot behaves actively based on the equivalent of a human’s motivation, then the people’s perception of agency toward the robot would be improved. We had human participants interact with a robot that had implemented the equivalent of a human’s motivation using the Free Energy Principle. Although not statistically significant, the results suggest a possible trend toward improved perception of agency for robots that showed active behavior compared to those that did not.", "authors": [{"name": "Kanako Esaki", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Yasuyuki Kudo", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Tadayuki Matsumura", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Takeshi Kato", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "M.

{"title": "Human-Robot Kinaesthetic Interactions Based on the Free-Energy Principle", "abstract": "The current study investigated possible human-robot kinaesthetic interactions using a variational recurrent neural network (RNN) model, called PV-RNN, which is based on the free-energy principle. Our prior robotic studies using PV-RNN showed that the nature of interactions between the top-down expectation and bottom-up inference is strongly affected by a parameter, called the meta-prior, which regulates the complexity term in free energy. The current study examines how changing the meta-prior w in the interaction phase affects the counter force generated when an experimenter attempts to induce movement pattern transitions familiar to the robot through its prior training. The study also compares the counter force generated when trained transitions are induced by a human experimenter and when untrained transitions are induced. Finally, the study examines how different levels of disturbances, pattern level, and cognitive level can be resolved internally across different layers. Our experimental results indicated that 1) the human experimenter needs more/less force to induce trained transitions when w is set with larger/smaller values; 2) the human experimenter needs more force to act on the robot when he attempts to induce untrained as opposed to trained movement pattern transitions; and 3) when the robot was disturbed in the cognitive level, the disturbance was resolved more in the higher layer as compared to the case with disturbance in the pattern level. Our analysis of time development of essential variables and values in PV-RNN during bodily interaction clarified the mechanism by which gaps in action intentions between the human experimenter and the robot can be manifested as reaction forces between them.", "authors": [{"name": "Hiroki Sawada", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Wataru Ohata", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Jun Tani", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2025, "doi": "10.1109/TSMC.2024.3481251", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": "1786b1080f56c8816d360a73005b676c684b1478", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems", "citation_count": 4, "references": [], "publication_date": null}

{"title": "Improving the Minimum Free Energy Principle to the Maximum Information Efficiency Principle", "abstract": "Friston proposed the Minimum Free Energy Principle (FEP) based on the Variational Bayesian (VB) method. This principle emphasizes that the brain and behavior coordinate with the environment, promoting self-organization. However, it has a theoretical flaw, a possibility of being misunderstood, and a limitation (only likelihood functions are used as constraints). This paper first introduces the semantic information G theory and the R(G) function (where R is the minimum mutual information for the given semantic mutual information G). The G theory is based on the P-T probability framework and, therefore, allows for the use of truth, membership, similarity, and distortion functions (related to semantics) as constraints. Based on the study of the R(G) function and logical Bayesian Inference, this paper proposes the Semantic Variational Bayesian (SVB) and the Maximum Information Efficiency (MIE) principle. Theoretic analysis and computing experiments prove that R − G = F − H(X|Y) (where F denotes VFE, and H(X|Y) is Shannon conditional entropy) instead of F continues to decrease when optimizing latent variables; SVB is a reliable and straightforward approach for latent variables and active inference. This paper also explains the relationship between information, entropy, free energy, and VFE in local non-equilibrium and equilibrium systems, concluding that Shannon information, semantic information, and VFE are analogous to the increment of free energy, the increment of exergy, and physical conditional entropy. The MIE principle builds upon the fundamental ideas of the FEP, making them easier to understand and apply. It needs to combine deep learning methods for wider applications.", "authors": [{"name": "Chenguang Lu", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2025, "doi": "10.3390/e27070684", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": "6bc015e24e7410a618b8844f9c9136c0f1e68a16", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "Entropy", "citation_count": 0, "references": ["s2:b89556687e75f2e13ff6080f27a2f02ba808e31f", "s2:3dd7dea3fc592d9b865c8b1bca16b4075a8902ec", "s2:b931fd8530b54cecc3ce1f4526391305c39f68a6", "s2:db37b9b52aeb8e7672321ab68b086e84cd93b521", "s2:e54427100b2de8187fe3b96303653b6220aaad44", "s2:1690c226497c545ade31f6860a07b8ef854b5e93", "s2:e6d093f44714f2ff38abbab34c78aa68edd074da", "s2:3aa088335e4f13589a1b9c4bd43bdeef015e57ba", "s2:1d3063fd158b4b1c56adb340278e2146cc7696ba", "s2:560a76fdb258f05c9166ca7f7ce051c4a96ce812", "s2:af5c03a96b5b4b45bb20ac76c5a44fb40b761849", "s2:115a42642f4d1c1d5a8b5fe150ee0ccb04f73a4a", "s2:2d04c6e50e6334593131ec23c9ffcae1ae706229", "s2:bd3dc136a8d755a961e676c68327d13cbb35f8a8", "s2:b227f3e4c0dc96e5ac5426b85485a70f2175a205", "s2:bb17ff968ae1dbd772ac337f469d1ca915cb4c03", "s2:1c167b1ce9928d46259937bb13dbc2c6ef7aed8f", "s2:6241eedef773c8d2bf1ef3ffda495eae3f1d137c", "s2:182e9f80e6c495410cf1271510f6bbfedba6ef4c", "s2:c7f581a062ac08b3717c27877ad62cfaefc1a9b5", "s2:cbf4040cb14a019ff3556fad5c455e99737f169f", "s2:bb4fe6e943c11eaa7c89071e1768046e3a2ff00b", "s2:88789ee88311acef28475ad33dbcd6b3c4be8358", "s2:87f40e6f3022adbc1f1905e3e506abad05a9964f", "s2:f6b51c8753a871dc94ff32152c00c01e94f90f09", "s2:1ed6a4a10589618d4f26350f1a296ee767ceff6b", "s2:ad0f1314b0f17fb793d25e0adb97ec397c81e05d", "s2:eb79f4d658f5903ea47ca7286dae7e58bbfdd8ad", "s2:9f87a11a523e4680e61966e36ea2eac516096f23", "s2:d0f3bbe7b5654427246bee62650f8f89ec3ba26c", "s2:25c9f33aceac6dcff357727cbe2faf145b01d13c", "s2:173ca54dd833a28febd30c34eda3f88a73760df8", "s2:ecc4f1e17ca2a43f447a254c8a24e67bfcd9be42", "s2:d36efb9ad91e00faa334b549ce989bfae7e2907a", "s2:08b67692bc037eada8d3d7ce76cc70994e7c8116", "s2:950fcae75bfb62465a30b4fce2104f2c6e75e555", "s2:d3ec204ca078254673e703e473500454db878686", "s2:00cf63a7926a826f7cf73c1d5edb117f98d70c2c", "s2:ca60bf38e730692564351c3df3d2fe0ee9a690ff", "s2:6171f0bb7587a8d7b11be65f3379bce46ff7658b", "s2:da3e4a8ad14b66c60e838def7ad4ed656190969b"], "publication_date": null}

The free-energy principle (FEP) advocated by Karl Friston explicates the local, recurrent, and self-supervised cognitive dynamics of the brain’s higher-order functions. In this study, we continue to refine the FEP through a physics-guided formulation; specifically, we apply our theory to synaptic learning by considering it an inference problem under the FEP and derive the governing equations, called Bayesian mechanics. Our study uncovers how the brain infers weight changes and postsynaptic activity, conditioned on the presynaptic input, by deploying generative models of the likelihood and prior belief. Consequently, we exemplify the synaptic efficacy in the brain with a simple model; in particular, we illustrate that the brain organizes an optimal trajectory in neural phase space during synaptic learning in continuous time, which variationally minimizes synaptic surprisal.", "authors": [{"name": "Chang Sub Kim", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2024, "doi": "10.3390/e26110984", "arxiv_id": "2410.02972", "s2_id": "7d4b345f74b9acb6609da078e3c95851540a9368", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "Entropy", "citation_count": 1, "references": ["s2:6697f79adc6bdd9e84827aa0233d8a0e6236a30d", "s2:51cb188e53f8a8bc51cd7a671391d3ad5adfb8e2", "s2:d825739e809fda310f0c7e036599685e6df7be8a", "s2:8ed1f627215595a6fcbf6bf09342145ac7d5e71e", "s2:e54427100b2de8187fe3b96303653b6220aaad44", "s2:e1ceb560bf8abfbbd898bb0514c3e795417a2eeb", "s2:dea44fc6f070051aa782b42ced0837cdf4d585d7", "s2:16aef42d9b453dad02a7aba750825bcb6e049bc1", "s2:414eb58e4239cda5596f22256cd2c2a848c10fd4", "s2:eed29a83ae9c69ee809dde58c7898106d7600e4b", "s2:a934a3a7f171d494556a80d31f7bf4b637376c71", "s2:964c7815fc48d6040509e37e8ceb95a683be58ef", "s2:c1a1541d244a60de002052fbe8d7a816f1a668dc", "s2:2113af2c71526b211612586daa185d326712cb9c", "s2:850fabb25f3f977b7a33867eb974e0840ffb9e73", "s2:9c96c12e712d96ba5e751c4d2f4d4225f840b4ca", "s2:754b657330b1674d3453e8254d3a664db5222b3b", "s2:927c9e05ba5d63692864b0aec3e9b65a6e920363", "s2:01aa6ef498431fb8c6d45e9375bb39a7a923b9bb", "s2:193edd20cae92c6759c18ce93eeea96afd9528eb", "s2:69304ba2c5d2bff09f7059916ab0aa117bdbea41", "s2:4890d678183a2e14a65e5669fc929fe8ddb21a10", "s2:1ed6a4a10589618d4f26350f1a296ee767ceff6b", "s2:e518d831ff819019dd7f9de541983a19e6e79941", "s2:c09fb7cfa28cde7ab254f878a5987758b8c5f4d0", "s2:b06f7f73ec4840f5ff801b51d38a9f754c9efc27", "s2:c7dbbd83bd661a3804e0422c4d7dafe6f3848f21", "s2:bf15128e48db7aaa9146328d965fc81dbdf4db3f", "s2:c90778b804faf8d3ad7cd6164865809394fa58e5", "s2:7dbdb4209626fd92d2436a058663206216036e68", "s2:f42ed1ca8051f73253ba709fa83b7dda69685278", "s2:8dcc86121219fdb9f813d43b35c632811da18b73", "s2:c7b64065c401a78db0f557db7cfa5a454815486b", "s2:d013daac5b6a3464b5691b3c2b44f4b565c3778f", "s2:62f50ddebe9db1f12851e5cf56960c3fec46cb2f", "s2:576eb9e05b083796b78af9152e6d6a06870aa558", "s2:b9164335be5808ddd59786869a9f992331af5218", "s2:4f8d648c52edf74e41b0996128aa536e13cc7e82", "s2:329705a255360c8f86a10d909a92794ed8a0857a", "s2:a424ec3b8846f57b8ffdb566d272e28d5a525909", "s2:56836b2d3f62f069ac2244dbb07699edfbe9dc4d", "s2:0cd557ccfacc9dbbaec40c6768dc92e3a4d04c9a", "s2:3e00dd12caea7c4dab1633a35d1da3cb2e76b420", "s2:de39028ea1122d09649a42b12e04c8f349ebe8a6", "s2:ef10c9d9a66c8b093f98984267670de9aeed809b"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Buddy System: An Adaptive Mental State Support System Based on Active Inference and Free-Energy Principles", "abstract": "To support a healthy human mental state, controlling the environment is one of the best-known solutions. However, it is difficult to design an environmental control system because of the uniqueness of individual preferences and mental state fluctuations. Here, we propose “Buddy system” as an adaptive mental state support solution that controls devices in the environment, depending on the recognized user’s mental state at the time and how it could be improved, serving a role similar to a “buddy” to individuals. The recognition of mental states and the locus of actions to control one’s surrounding environment are implemented on the basis of a brain-derived theory of computation known as active inference and free-energy principles, which provide biologically plausible computations for perceptions and behavior in a changing world. For the generation of actions, we modify the general calculations of active inference to adjust to individual environmental preferences. In the experiments, the Buddy system sought to maintain the participants’ concentration while a calculation task was conducted. As a result, the task performance for most of the participants was improved through the aid of the Buddy system. The results indicated that the Buddy system can adaptively support to improve the mental states of individual users.", "authors": [{"name": "Motoko Iwashita", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Makiko Ishikawa", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2022, "doi": "10.1109/TCDS.2021.3102993", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": "a6189d87d3d726bc89d994ed1dab1a21bfca3122", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental Systems", "citation_count": 2, "references": ["s2:f2a69a6de41ab83358c912fc48eccd74b476f1f1", "s2:9b167315c4b539824dbfae03d62f7eb9e3fc66cb", "s2:4790ad7643318714e1596f2ad44de995a8b678ae", "s2:6417d1bfc8f7dc8df7b04e50f8eb9188784b776a", "s2:ccfe49d9a320bfe47b16a7ebe1a7a9c5f41ccae3", "s2:1dc4001974f99122610964b3731882cca9c228a0", "s2:b6021361c1ba270619ee53768b5f15063a5fb1ed", "s2:67102ffcdccaa170e1dfa19230fd031c6b969dff", "s2:754b657330b1674d3453e8254d3a664db5222b3b", "s2:57070167d647bfa23bc5c5895623af13576db66b", "s2:7f0def1a06618e964a04ad6af9af01de66d3b9f3", "s2:63c938f5e06a1f6ff7cb243b296d232b1e54d75e", "s2:2db4b64d2d0862016c3b13542e44ee8573fdc6a7", "s2:d2c4d845f56a132b1078adb85490b0f8a5730d2e", "s2:57620e357ee348cd5ffa8eafa480e002a2aba06a", "s2:c9cb8fad8fd60b71eb5c758a91c9c32b75b96864", "s2:3c28037eff0c6c262f24d4ea27b151e010fa37ad", "s2:489e9cfcf1a6e945517ba219b4c941133ba28601", "s2:c4492b7114e520e5dd04582bd84b5bfee3b91610", "s2:f75a020fbb984294c2f566d84fcd5318e4dcac06", "s2:0ef7c87833a09ed5310da23df36139002b9e59b3", "s2:407bb3034daac0fb4fba3d4c09ef3a26dfbfcf5f", "s2:1ed6a4a10589618d4f26350f1a296ee767ceff6b", "s2:a7c3e3fda30aec943f34c4862ce7e51bf5e5a453", "s2:1a014a076cac3c7f5d81a084e296c095f9230437", "s2:c09fb7cfa28cde7ab254f878a5987758b8c5f4d0", "s2:789d077d056ec68b8a67c322a40224dce834e9a7", "s2:cd3fcea13020382c191925fb10630f839fbfccd5", "s2:ba40009375fb2cae3490e7a895929df72e56440c", "s2:8a8428f58625f78f982e88d01624b80096ae9890", "s2:0ea24ffe3bee9faeeead947c6c7ab00c99f5ccf2", "s2:d15bdf485f3a64abb59e4d0d1d1b18a9fc652bf9", "s2:9f7cdb5d15baeb8a5049c379a8fc5bcf93e2b26d", "s2:38f8dfcd7fc00b0a0471560100bd121754e40839", "s2:c495e3a3405c8202b29e00a72144d87f2f3dd7d2", "s2:0fdd66fcf6b9bc04428e337df66fd510a659eb2f", "s2:a1214b2f192267e0fefc8e1948f682420bc08810", "s2:20de214263c9cd9aedcecab36277ff48421c4419", "s2:4b062cb51b61e45b41ed5d8b51935bd87eb1beed", "s2:02886c09a6888a42b33d6e42008954b49f53d3ea", "s2:07027c77722401116fbd21ce047dd1a710cdb51e", "s2:98b18f0d10f99cd4b28d79d23898de2b90fb98aa"], "publication_date": null}

Our investigation includes optimizing molecular structure, analyzing natural bond orbitals analysis and determining natural charges. Molecular electrostatic potential investigation allowed us to classify both electrophilic and nucleophilic sites. In order to comprehend NTAH's chemical reactivity and stability, nous additionally evaluated the highest occupied molecular orbital to lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energies. Additionally, we investigated how the solvent affected the kinetic stability, responsiveness, and electrical characteristics of NTAH in solvent and gas. Noncovalent contacts were investigated using Hirshfeld surface methodology. Furthermore, we assessed NTAH’s biological function capability and drug-likeness using molecular docking. Comparing NTAH’s energy gap in water (3.962 eV) against gas (4.065 eV), DMSO (3.964 eV), and methanol (3.965 eV), quantum characteristics showed that NTAH was more reactive in water. Since NTAH complied with Lipinski’s rule of five experiments exhibited good drug-likeness and bioavailability. Promising binding affinities of −6.16, −5.8, −5.5, −6.24, and −5.92 kcal/mol were observed in molecular docking tests toward proteins 5X5D, 6ZXO, 6OJU, 1HW3, and 6K7Q indicating possible anticancer chemotherapeutic efficacy against these proteins.", "authors": [{"name": "V.

{"title": "Human-Robot Kinaesthetic Interaction Based on Free Energy Principle", "abstract": "The current study investigated possible human-robot kinaesthetic interaction using a variational recurrent neural network model, called PV-RNN, which is based on the free energy principle. Our prior robotic studies using PV-RNN showed that the nature of interactions between top-down expectation and bottom-up inference is strongly affected by a parameter, called the meta-prior, which regulates the complexity term in free energy.The study also compares the counter force generated when trained transitions are induced by a human experimenter and when untrained transitions are induced. Our experimental results indicated that (1) the human experimenter needs more/less force to induce trained transitions when $w$ is set with larger/smaller values, (2) the human experimenter needs more force to act on the robot when he attempts to induce untrained as opposed to trained movement pattern transitions. Our analysis of time development of essential variables and values in PV-RNN during bodily interaction clarified the mechanism by which gaps in actional intentions between the human experimenter and the robot can be manifested as reaction forces between them.", "authors": [{"name": "Hiroki Sawada", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Wataru Ohata", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "J.

{"title": "Experimental validation of the free-energy principle with in vitro neural networks", "abstract": "Empirical applications of the free-energy principle are not straightforward because they entail a commitment to a particular process theory, especially at the cellular and synaptic levels. Using a recently established reverse engineering technique, we confirm the quantitative predictions of the free-energy principle using in vitro networks of rat cortical neurons that perform causal inference. Upon receiving electrical stimuli—generated by mixing two hidden sources—neurons self-organised to selectively encode the two sources. Pharmacological up- and downregulation of network excitability disrupted the ensuing inference, consistent with changes in prior beliefs about hidden sources. As predicted, changes in effective synaptic connectivity reduced variational free energy, where the connection strengths encoded parameters of the generative model. In short, we show that variational free energy minimisation can quantitatively predict the self-organisation of neuronal networks, in terms of their responses and plasticity. These results demonstrate the applicability of the free-energy principle to in vitro neural networks and establish its predictive validity in this setting.", "authors": [{"name": "Takuya Isomura", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "K.

{"title": "Episodic Visual Hallucinations, Inference and Free Energy", "abstract": "Understandings of how visual hallucinations appear have been highly influenced by generative approaches, in particular Friston’s Active Inference conceptualization. Their core proposition is that these phenomena occur when hallucinatory expectations outweigh actual sensory data. This imbalance occurs as the brain seeks to minimize informational free energy, a measure of the distance between predicted and actual sensory data in a stationary open system. We review this approach in the light of old and new information on the role of environmental factors in episodic hallucinations. In particular, we highlight the possible relationship of specific visual triggers to the onset and offset of some episodes. We use an analogy from phase transitions in physics to explore factors which might account for intermittent shifts between veridical and hallucinatory vision. In these triggered forms of hallucinations, we suggest that there is a transient disturbance in the normal one-to-one correspondence between a real object and the counterpart perception such that this correspondence becomes between the real object and a hallucination. Generative models propose that a lack of information transfer from the environment to the brain is one of the key features of hallucinations. In contrast, we submit that specific information transfer is required at onset and offset in these cases. We propose that this transient one-to-one correspondence between environment and hallucination is mediated more by aberrant discriminative than by generative inference. Discriminative inference can be conceptualized as a process for maximizing shared information between the environment and perception within a self-organizing nonstationary system. We suggest that generative inference plays the greater role in established hallucinations and in the persistence of individual hallucinatory episodes. We further explore whether thermodynamic free energy may be an additional factor in why hallucinations are temporary. Future empirical research could productively concentrate on three areas. Firstly, subjective perceptual changes and parallel variations in brain function during specific transitions between veridical and hallucinatory vision to inform models of how episodes occur. Secondly, systematic investigation of the links between environment and hallucination episodes to probe the role of information transfer in triggering transitions between veridical and hallucinatory vision. Finally, changes in hallucinatory episodes over time to elucidate the role of learning on phenomenology. These empirical data will allow the potential roles of different forms of inference in the stages of hallucinatory episodes to be elucidated.", "authors": [{"name": "Daniel Collerton", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Ichiro Tsuda", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Shigetoshi Nara", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2024, "doi": "10.3390/e26070557", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": "192a21051368e3753219f62709d63704a4c9b453", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "Entropy", "citation_count": 4, "references": [], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "A Technical Critique of Some Parts of the Free Energy Principle", "abstract": "We summarize the original formulation of the free energy principle and highlight some technical issues. We discuss how these issues affect related results involving generalised coordinates and, where appropriate, mention consequences for and reveal, up to now unacknowledged, differences from newer formulations of the free energy principle. In particular, we reveal that various definitions of the “Markov blanket” proposed in different works are not equivalent. We show that crucial steps in the free energy argument, which involve rewriting the equations of motion of systems with Markov blankets, are not generally correct without additional (previously unstated) assumptions. We prove by counterexamples that the original free energy lemma, when taken at face value, is wrong. We show further that this free energy lemma, when it does hold, implies the equality of variational density and ergodic conditional density. The interpretation in terms of Bayesian inference hinges on this point, and we hence conclude that it is not sufficiently justified. Additionally, we highlight that the variational densities presented in newer formulations of the free energy principle and lemma are parametrised by different variables than in older works, leading to a substantially different interpretation of the theory. Note that we only highlight some specific problems in the discussed publications. These problems do not rule out conclusively that the general ideas behind the free energy principle are worth pursuing.", "authors": [{"name": "Martin Biehl", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "F.

{"title": "The free energy principle for action and perception: A mathematical review", "abstract": "The ‘free energy principle’ (FEP) has been suggested to provide a unified theory of the brain, integrating data and theory relating to action, perception, and learning. The theory and implementation of the FEP combines insights from Helmholtzian ‘perception as inference’, machine learning theory, and statistical thermodynamics. Here, we provide a detailed mathematical evaluation of a suggested biologically plausible implementation of the FEP that has been widely used to develop the theory. Our objectives are (i) to describe within a single article the mathematical structure of this implementation of the FEP; (ii) provide a simple but complete agent-based model utilising the FEP and (iii) to disclose the assumption structure of this implementation of the FEP to help elucidate its significance for the brain sciences.", "authors": [{"name": "C.

In this work, we introduce the active inference framework (AIF) into SCC-enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems for joint state estimation, control, and sensing resource allocation. By formulating a unified generative model, the problem reduces to minimizing variational free energy for inference and expected free energy for action planning.

{"title": "Active inference as a unified model of collision avoidance behavior in human drivers", "abstract": "Collision avoidance -- involving a rapid threat detection and quick execution of the appropriate evasive maneuver -- is a critical aspect of driving. However, existing models of human collision avoidance behavior are fragmented, focusing on specific scenarios or only describing certain aspects of the avoidance behavior, such as response times. This paper addresses these gaps by proposing a novel computational cognitive model of human collision avoidance behavior based on active inference. Active inference provides a unified approach to modeling human behavior: the minimization of free energy. Building on prior active inference work, our model incorporates established cognitive mechanisms such as evidence accumulation to simulate human responses in two distinct collision avoidance scenarios: front-to-rear lead vehicle braking and lateral incursion by an oncoming vehicle. We demonstrate that our model explains a wide range of previous empirical findings on human collision avoidance behavior. Specifically, the model closely reproduces both aggregate results from meta-analyses previously reported in the literature and detailed, scenario-specific effects observed in a recent driving simulator study, including response timing, maneuver selection, and execution.

{"title": "Active inference for action-unaware agents", "abstract": "Active inference is a formal approach to study cognition based on the notion that adaptive agents can be seen as engaging in a process of approximate Bayesian inference, via the minimisation of variational and expected free energies. Minimising the former provides an account of perceptual processes and learning as evidence accumulation, while minimising the latter describes how agents select their actions over time. In this way, adaptive agents are able to maximise the likelihood of preferred observations or states, given a generative model of the environment. In the literature, however, different strategies have been proposed to describe how agents can plan their future actions. While they all share the notion that some kind of expected free energy offers an appropriate way to score policies, sequences of actions, in terms of their desirability, there are different ways to consider the contribution of past motor experience to the agent's future behaviour. In some approaches, agents are assumed to know their own actions, and use such knowledge to better plan for the future. In other approaches, agents are unaware of their actions, and must infer their motor behaviour from recent observations in order to plan for the future. This difference reflects a standard point of departure in two leading frameworks in motor control based on the presence, or not, of an efference copy signal representing knowledge about an agent's own actions. In this work we compare the performances of action-aware and action-unaware agents in two navigations tasks, showing how action-unaware agents can achieve performances comparable to action-aware ones while at a severe disadvantage.", "authors": [{"name": "Filippo Torresan", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Keisuke Suzuki", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Ryota Kanai", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Manuel Baltieri", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2025, "doi": "10.48550/arXiv.2508.12027", "arxiv_id": "2508.12027", "s2_id": "04c23ac20d792471905fc36b0a0e5a361b16e887", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "arXiv.org", "citation_count": 2, "references": [], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Active Digital Twins via Active Inference", "abstract": "Digital twins are transforming engineering and applied sciences by enabling real-time monitoring, simulation, and predictive analysis of physical systems and processes. However, conventional digital twins rely primarily on passive data assimilation, which limits their adaptability in uncertain and dynamic environments. This paper introduces the active digital twin paradigm, based on active inference. Active inference is a neuroscience-inspired, Bayesian framework for probabilistic reasoning and predictive modeling that unifies inference, decision-making, and learning under a unique, free energy minimization objective. By formulating the evolution of the active digital twin as a partially observable Markov decision process, the active inference agent continuously refines its generative model through Bayesian updates and forecasts future states and observations. Decision-making emerges from an optimization process that balances pragmatic exploitation (maximizing goal-directed utility) and epistemic exploration or information gain (actively resolving uncertainty). Actions are dynamically planned to minimize expected free energy, which quantifies both the divergence between predicted and preferred future observations, and the epistemic value of expected information gain about hidden states. This approach enables a new level of autonomy and resilience in digital twins, offering superior spontaneous exploration capabilities. The proposed framework is assessed on the health monitoring and predictive maintenance of a railway bridge.", "authors": [{"name": "Matteo Torzoni", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Domenico Maisto", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Andrea Manzoni", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Francesco Donnarumma", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Giovanni Pezzulo", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Alberto Corigliano", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2025, "doi": "10.48550/arXiv.2506.14453", "arxiv_id": "2506.14453", "s2_id": "69f3edafc5ff1b4ba355ce4b6603c0e08092fb7a", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "arXiv.org", "citation_count": 1, "references": ["s2:39fd930a80b18e5c271555218d5d1110438a3699", "s2:a8bb9608e7121b84b22d697bc9413306d6cdb725", "s2:7b284a969eda3e5d163a2487340a9f580196810d", "s2:d7c5ddf0a87c776976e98092b44a554d7bfac4ba", "s2:2811382964bedc338a4f818105eacd2ccf888f9b", "s2:54d0275e0a9fb508e9ea1910d3ec62b6c3345af8", "s2:00d8e0a0d8cfe0f0e68654a28f9ac6006d9cd3a9", "s2:a5d1b2c132d4e3052478e9e0357439f29ec175e8", "s2:ca063e068656a25a5b6da40ba03d011ccdba01b4", "s2:7bc2ee4217dc00b6df888d1eb2e6fea3ec080752", "s2:49172ee106f75d3aafd6a97d1da0843d74104b58", "s2:c6d4c7eaa2341b7526c4866a8109cd74379c4e13", "s2:dded71d2681fb42c1d149286b636b066ab6a0910", "s2:05adbcee5e4ae6ddef17174f1dd787910fe06f3f", "s2:f37d3c23e21b1f963da64a115e604fc312ce67e9", "s2:09d74c15ed92c5df3f003f39db7fa231806adbd0", "s2:0c3adf2b221cd13e7aac090667d0adfabb0a0c88", "s2:ef64e8c681f06911b6754bd4836a197a5b110a28", "s2:1b067444c88554525dd2dd6234c4626b8622effe", "s2:da741827ab6f5bf9762d30b91fd2409ac9e0e272", "s2:f4e5125837a7ae3eb20e9f55ecad2dc63c450f8c", "s2:f6dbeefdc962d78014c9c05f96582030efaf4280", "s2:6610574c0d2902406f7c950ba008eae7e3db4a36", "s2:489928825f97b34e555e0979c87f3497291f00a7", "s2:2ad8a8946b87c5dee5cc2b94b2171b994d100099", "s2:f216f1f0021763f0d8d9bba882b0b02fa2525fbd", "s2:922bf8b3343a7cc105e2ca04edf36760d39d6c9c", "s2:d2d107630f062018ddc806798811cdb0e293ec78", "s2:8be55833180ec2d2fa3a0ad8f632a4e7aa2aa8d0", "s2:6b9005262e60ac31b81ae53c6568cb5653d41af2", "s2:d825092cebfba0321e821d669e837fc03d5fb1f9", "s2:19cf01454febeedb854c74a422080273dc50d2eb", "s2:b4e3d64771a63f6990bdce638b1e062f83395a96", "s2:16aef42d9b453dad02a7aba750825bcb6e049bc1", "s2:a5cb37af2a443f5d7c7c718ac7d1676d43a78f0c", "s2:931306769105f76da3f6987ad342370ede00be10", "s2:67c6eb9de9aab00ee4e8da7c83a47899f0205ae8", "s2:cf197fe0ae235ca96164584c02561c0f8eef3811", "s2:af810cacb9992794e0247487a76d377d8e52dc25", "s2:a9a7791fe867c4a6bdcbbcc07f20c501c68858c9", "s2:a595767fa35bcc84362f629fbc4d2d9b05d7342a", "s2:bdba2d26e60a60a11738718e591e0bc5e6d9085e", "s2:c537aeb8da1788fc0d6af38d9f21faa5385035cf", "s2:1c167b1ce9928d46259937bb13dbc2c6ef7aed8f", "s2:185b7f3c6fe8e647ae9c79fbb463768b64c59a52", "s2:dc8fb699df3504befcdf4037fb625d81f08a2876", "s2:754b657330b1674d3453e8254d3a664db5222b3b", "s2:391ea7ef17e33b432d5b38b59a0529375b9d92ea", "s2:368132f8dfcbd6e857dfc1b7dce2ab91bd9648ad", "s2:1a1a95c35fc362c771660fe3e211246df16d10d0", "s2:57620e357ee348cd5ffa8eafa480e002a2aba06a", "s2:42998f6a0ef243ffb5555ced81319ea5e8bba788", "s2:1ed6a4a10589618d4f26350f1a296ee767ceff6b", "s2:36eb6fea39ce06e2807f074fa3d5e79ed0f2bcef", "s2:3c70ff1d03fc2928569f598485383e535320ff33", "s2:d98d0d1900b13b87aa4ffd6b69c046beb63f0434", "s2:61ffaf9a7a68d063a34590bc3c59a3809123f9f1", "s2:668b1277fbece28c4841eeab1c97e4ebd0079700", "s2:6b247cab5fa3665e5b92b3c366e1bde449eeb42a", "s2:9096d45e30df7ec95eca9708c3707a969c588be5", "s2:116d7798c1123cf7fad4176e98f58fd49de4f8f1", "s2:c43d679fe355f6409e227c546e11da044e01d592", "s2:3057b47d756a541fcc769a17ce1eb9a66de982e6", "s2:ac7701c84dcb8ddf3a2b908a1e4d97df59e06737", "s2:75a8ba5c58324c6af291ab8dad41caf7a206aca5", "s2:96eb8c9c9a125f64418592a0b1ca23f0f6cc91e8", "s2:f2145771e7eae7d3744887b495c104ecb91b6e88", "s2:894a0f17789df56eee7e595cf90d1f9393332533", "s2:e65d5ca2a2efe6f5756f579029def41fac4b374e", "s2:c77777833962afadef89f1a1e524e7f3a46f5888"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Active Inference with Dynamic Planning and Information Gain in Continuous Space by Inferring Low-Dimensional Latent States", "abstract": "Active inference offers a unified framework in which agents can exhibit both goal-directed and epistemic behaviors. However, implementing policy search in high-dimensional continuous action spaces presents challenges in terms of scalability and stability. Our previously proposed model, T-GLean, addressed this issue by enabling efficient goal-directed planning through low-dimensional latent space search, further reduced by conditioning on prior habituated behavior. However, the lack of an epistemic term in minimizing expected free energy limited the agent’s ability to engage in information-seeking behavior that can be critical for attaining preferred outcomes. In this study, we present EFE-GLean, an extended version of T-GLean that overcomes this limitation by integrating epistemic value into the planning process. EFE-GLean generates goal-directed policies by inferring low-dimensional future posterior trajectories while maximizing expected information gain. Simulation experiments using an extended T-maze task—implemented in both discrete and continuous domains—demonstrate that the agent can successfully achieve its goals by exploiting hidden environmental information. Furthermore, we show that the agent is capable of adapting to abrupt environmental changes by dynamically revising plans through simultaneous minimization of past variational free energy and future expected free energy. Finally, analytical evaluations detail the underlying mechanisms and computational properties of the model.", "authors": [{"name": "Takazumi Matsumoto", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Kentaro Fujii", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Shingo Murata", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Jun Tani", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2025, "doi": "10.3390/e27080846", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": "326af481ee2dc10919a1f185e8fc9edecdadc593", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "Entropy", "citation_count": 1, "references": ["s2:2c1fe8a9e95a3e4071bb9b91da1411e931787256", "s2:b13e9d3e36d4429b3e6563bcd4aee52e18c41d0a", "s2:25087b731eb2a1a28c141cd673f8080681adb886", "s2:25bdf3dc811147d41b155c7de462603324720c82", "s2:6525e8db085289c8ad85640a7f9343f626cac951", "s2:b449eddf2f994edf1b87bd5c8fc927d49391ab98", "s2:4d6d5233f5e866d23b32494c140e08ea49896e11", "s2:2197f3c2270f267e5e37d0e3e51979d1304cf9dd", "s2:b44bb1762640ed72091fd5f5fdc20719a6dc24af", "s2:2c0203ff41fbe8f3fc2a0e706ecb3ecf806f2108", "s2:67c6eb9de9aab00ee4e8da7c83a47899f0205ae8", "s2:a1a037fb9c03ad80fffa05798c8870552710dc52", "s2:207ee7167576465c451c8c85c84575dcb6120bc1", "s2:25ffa86f4dd81b3795d39f1a0caa957c39bc40b3", "s2:4790ad7643318714e1596f2ad44de995a8b678ae", "s2:1dc4001974f99122610964b3731882cca9c228a0", "s2:ffd0f679a631b733ba2f779ce1aa0e5bbde3a8b0", "s2:fea3e63c97c7292dc6fbcb3ffe7131eb54053986", "s2:a38f9509076dd78d4c61292f2f90a070766b5107", "s2:e09f6b0ddee0f7cfd1a7e2d56899f2d8d8774e77", "s2:c219439493dc8a95331516995e64d5726f241d72", "s2:57620e357ee348cd5ffa8eafa480e002a2aba06a", "s2:a84d3293d487626197b5b494c55144e62662a258", "s2:9468634b94fbded8b3362bdf230ab2becba0c0ef", "s2:6960215d50f54e1815e03f8e040d0e782470ce2f", "s2:641a9d87b9636d4ef2e353a569ddede68bd29131", "s2:319f22bd5abfd67ac15988aa5c7f705f018c3ccd", "s2:7419dc117da3ecef70c5121be2d28f66a58be500", "s2:ef4f5a50837a7c1b3e87b9300ffc7ba00d461a0f", "s2:0fdd66fcf6b9bc04428e337df66fd510a659eb2f"], "publication_date": null}

We present an AIF agent with continuous state, action, and observation spaces, performing one-dimensional mouse pointing and clicking. We use a simple underlying dynamic system to model the mouse cursor dynamics with realistic perceptual delay. In contrast to previous optimal feedback control-based models, the agent's actions are selected by minimizing Expected Free Energy, solely based on preference distributions over percepts, such as observing clicking a button correctly. Our results show that the agent creates plausible pointing movements and clicks when the cursor is over the target, with similar end-point variance to human users. In contrast to other models of pointing, we incorporate fully probabilistic, predictive delay compensation into the agent. The agent shows distinct behaviour for differing target difficulties without the need to retune system parameters, as done in other approaches. We discuss the simulation results and emphasize the challenges in identifying the correct configuration of an AIF agent interacting with continuous systems.", "authors": [{"name": "Markus Klar", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Sebastian Stein", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Fraser Paterson", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "J.

{"title": "Born to act: Deferred action and desire as active inference", "abstract": "The active inference framework (AIF) considers the brain as a generative model guiding behavior under the imperative of minimizing the model’s variational free energy. Computationally, this is accomplished by hierarchical Bayesian inference. The theory views organisms as doxastic agents, which has drawn the criticism of being insufficient to explain conative agents motivated by desire. Specifically, it has been noted that the concept of desire is not isomorphic with belief and, therefore, fits poorly with AIF. In this paper, we build on previous work that suggests a path to integrating conation in AIF and present three arguments. First, the dichotomy between belief and desire is unnecessary. To that end, we define desire as a hierarchical inference that starts from a domain-general inference on the agent’s affective dynamics (affective charge) and descends to contextualized inference on the precision of action policies. We suggest that this hierarchy is implemented by a coordinated activity of the intrinsic brain networks: default mode, action mode, executive, and salient. Second, we argue for a central role that deferred action plays in the process of desire by allowing for affect-dependent awareness of the agent’s states over different timescales. Third, we suggest that the proposed model of desire and deferred action has ramifications for understanding psychopathology, which we frame as the malfunction of deferred action and desire and use obsessive-compulsive disorder and depression as examples. This view entails that disorders of affect and motivation are subjectively desired despite their associated suffering.", "authors": [{"name": "Valery Krupnik", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2025, "doi": "10.3758/s13415-025-01334-9", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": "0805bbf80a4d779acdf1fcaad40864a164f9f237", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "Cognitive, Affective, & Behavioral Neuroscience", "citation_count": 0, "references": ["s2:a82c507c0737a661ce3e0a49562e3404b433014d", "s2:a6485f2617e94a70c8d5459001866ef50f52aca9", "s2:9f1b7b6f7bf3aa6094334747d51f71e7d0cf619c", "s2:c6f7d2c5554ba2ed15612a38d90444d6146de62e", "s2:1bee0ff16cf2aa295062f1504f4c1b367496d0ee", "s2:e3dfeefc6d17e27b111a864a84905d88f3b96f3b", "s2:8d0a3cdc3e7309940e837ca7c84b43448b0020a5", "s2:4936be3639d59bc738a506ace87f2fb44939b309", "s2:8e8ee3503fa383617a3eeccfbc7c37b10f17c8c7", "s2:462d1b8d7b9156dbfa5cb93c001e5d84602886af", "s2:bb0ea0d6088b59f558ff306858a98a39b89ddc6c", "s2:dded71d2681fb42c1d149286b636b066ab6a0910", "s2:51cb188e53f8a8bc51cd7a671391d3ad5adfb8e2", "s2:de988c59211ce707201010db33fb6d4942a02b42", "s2:6096592fb72b800a88d0bd42ba63812ddb3b9d6b", "s2:6cbae4f9ae30eaf4610ea07ea949e22e441db40b", "s2:365c8b4e42c645ee930ec54b0d28c4cd8bf09698", "s2:3f352bd736eec916a82344c4ac1ec6cecef2d16c", "s2:259f44ff56cb6ef89151510e5c966520fb5ed3ed", "s2:8c15fd346fbc17c31b93f5a3a7c16f8bf8c21d56", "s2:f1e6cf99f7bfb0a027374c1d740e939ee8b6475e", "s2:207aad4642b20942ad0f42a89c7b84a0e9fb8d56", "s2:de4ecbe2b6c244480d098b62e605b5f69075ab49", "s2:aeda2732236e39faf3e829cb3aaba0618ef18f1f", "s2:42b1bb567e233fa2c0ee3c26e21bf87e24430ec5", "s2:8b9206ccf7bf5664fca52740f9431c41ecafe672", "s2:13fc63ff6dcd58893dd2383d29e4b9c4d0fb2ebf", "s2:1129472f53d122da31d4f4b14162bd4076ea355f", "s2:c03dfb5055002be859130cf0ce9906d4cb2e70aa", "s2:0b111867aa50d767c18b7fbe461fae5281ef108e", "s2:ce7b2d91778ba54c2c738875c6cc7a4383ab8720", "s2:e70dab703af5becdd7833e9f386ba5e4d639f0e1", "s2:0d1edabd156716c54cb347aa13ddac411f19ea1c", "s2:afc1cd8c3f8024900850005001770d72a9de11ab", "s2:3ffb6926ba0f0a433538bb22d88695f15fbfb479", "s2:99cf2259eb4fa8590d2142361c18469377a63ff7", "s2:c25ba8581ae5d0b01bde65a004746c60faa25621", "s2:e4525c9fb953683a5d52d731adac182033a00f1c", "s2:09806c3b252d1c26f69ce54214a6bd688f0e5f9c", "s2:fbadf6a484bb70a4b3acd4721cd2bd6a19643ea1", "s2:2f9b7c2bc2aa88b381cab4c4069359168bc75636", "s2:9cdf7c3e1d99984a59a4056e810859b274d230d3", "s2:83ad03d841b9aa1b05ab856b2d3959dec97eecd7", "s2:d834a8993d0aaddbbf61e84513360defef92ec4e", "s2:b8bac8bc6df266aab34bce18103c29ac527d200f", "s2:087ae9fb3b9730b5e8d6c58311ef9681ce840b8a", "s2:bb7f4f825b631c11230affa0db39520da77274e4", "s2:875616e479d9ac20e4dc8b71a08adee6270549fb", "s2:339e703939d58f16b9bc834ce2498f09634a7de9", "s2:f0dec84462032fc6338d0da95e3018e565c7ea87", "s2:9b92e5c0c156f2653fd7fe31e51dda45a7c8f3fc", "s2:d1901611a8b92dac51a66aa656e3686c8f7b674b", "s2:55e289026370ca83e1af97262d6faa269296b5f1", "s2:01aa6ef498431fb8c6d45e9375bb39a7a923b9bb", "s2:d6a84def3ddf9e50ee1cd697d5bab71c4636f4f8", "s2:75d7a24c114fb3c3ff3b6e474429a0fe51f9346b", "s2:cbd4ea71b0e559435c7229a5ad14a6787a7bf00a", "s2:9dc2c7aa616f0b82f05c571ba079aac4b80b24cb", "s2:55d61ff942e0b138024b6c8fcf629f2e88693659", "s2:935bd71a98e57c186a80e5d611abcba6f3a4d204", "s2:32440dc71cbd9030089ce1b5c291871d6c4cfa6b", "s2:4b94f846c631ba994be9e7e4b6eeefccb94e83a7", "s2:a6cb2d6cedc5b84cf92601cbdce572fa5802797f", "s2:d8978c97484146a81da63ada8f6229789925e6da", "s2:32352331c13c56997a199c4bac4903e43d9e9b49", "s2:50d548af47e5003e96bafb4ce4119a75c0a6d403", "s2:2ba788647916f6206f7fcc137fe7866c58e6211e", "s2:ebc69073614f68836121d1504d0725f5469ece95", "s2:f7a3f9bf535485fde94650f25fff26b6547abfdb", "s2:db83f773757b443a850e2b3d8a56c453e6efc50c", "s2:dfb9f3bb76e279e0a845412e1cf956b2c0a8c91d", "s2:81633b5a1f5fc85d2c3d3aa566f94fc4fcc71c5d", "s2:1ed6a4a10589618d4f26350f1a296ee767ceff6b", "s2:a878886efacc6a5d742bf98bfc25c0734ce502b1", "s2:31be814525670bb8c71ee7981eb30dc1e70b4555", "s2:369b741775686c14974158cb6b18893c95b9ae59", "s2:ce314cb1ef276388dc5b1af5c8d7635fd42257ce", "s2:478b8c8b058e4456417dee568e767aa43f0efcad", "s2:69d8e6b4bf20e74dc75f709f3d453953796c19f0", "s2:fe0948c52a414b54af10e4c92ef6300c70d0d970", "s2:975d960faabfe8a9aefcfb0eb929d0688a6136c0", "s2:04d73a1459d0eb1ce448776ae38871d0af985e3c", "s2:ee8317955dae5906e74940271daddfd46f3383bb", "s2:2bffc24a8bc083bf4c72fa7042776bfbee0910c3", "s2:ca702e84a894616750748cd7f8ab5b44bf298af7", "s2:e5796119960768dfaea8bd8fa68a74d17bedd74a", "s2:cb093943940e90435883f338c6e4056bd92e42e2"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Active Inference for an Intelligent Agent in Autonomous Reconnaissance Missions", "abstract": "We develop an active inference route-planning method for the autonomous control of intelligent agents. The aim is to reconnoiter a geographical area to maintain a common operational picture. To achieve this, we construct an evidence map that reflects our current understanding of the situation, incorporating both positive and\"negative\"sensor observations of possible target objects collected over time, and diffusing the evidence across the map as time progresses. The generative model of active inference uses Dempster-Shafer theory and a Gaussian sensor model, which provides input to the agent. The generative process employs a Bayesian approach to update a posterior probability distribution. We calculate the variational free energy for all positions within the area by assessing the divergence between a pignistic probability distribution of the evidence map and a posterior probability distribution of a target object based on the observations, including the level of surprise associated with receiving new observations.

{"title": "The neural correlates of novelty and variability in human decision-making under an active inference framework", "abstract": "Active inference integrates perception, decision-making, and learning into a united theoretical framework, providing an efficient way to trade off exploration and exploitation by minimizing (expected) free energy. In this study, we asked how the brain represents values and uncertainties (novelty and variability), and resolves these uncertainties under the active inference framework in the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Twenty-five participants performed a contextual two-armed bandit task, with electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. By comparing the model evidence for active inference and reinforcement learning models of choice behavior, we show that active inference better explains human decision-making under novelty and variability, which entails exploration or information seeking. The EEG sensor-level results show that the activity in the frontal, central, and parietal regions is associated with novelty, while the activity in the frontal and central brain regions is associated with variability. The EEG source-level results indicate that the expected free energy is encoded in the frontal pole and middle frontal gyrus and uncertainties are encoded in different brain regions but with overlap. Our study dissociates the expected free energy and uncertainties in active inference theory and their neural correlates, speaking to the construct validity of active inference in characterizing cognitive processes of human decisions. It provides behavioral and neural evidence of active inference in decision processes and insights into the neural mechanism of human decisions under uncertainties.", "authors": [{"name": "Shuo Zhang", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Yan Tian", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Quanying Liu", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Haiyan Wu", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2025, "doi": "10.7554/eLife.92892", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": "afb5c5237f4edbfb9e8930870d61c0a48c47f3fb", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "eLife", "citation_count": 0, "references": ["s2:2f5411605691f79a69a84ab0b7c0599678725484", "s2:3033845967bed43f32af66c52ab95a8d55423132", "s2:2348df9b62fa27c0d45df2fd2787693090996cab", "s2:d077f5413b968161e0d91f9a7580e266dfb6c0af", "s2:791a775b8f146309998e776c4176471bb49d104c", "s2:d0249684a4ef8236ab869dd9ddede726c7a7a1a8", "s2:e3c342bbc7cca1e5b26979fef94f6fb98af478c4", "s2:6ac3885b715bce40a83438e9b0983adcc58f95f8", "s2:744139d65c3bf6da6a6acd384a32d94a06f44f62", "s2:2fa7f7b342766d734bb105f31287ef2059aa9a5a", "s2:7980addad56a916e0f1b2c47a9a2e9f4f0a20767", "s2:2b768e9db28c9363da71c8cdf1784c782a4e401f", "s2:04d57befd04853dcbb5ea479aae196ec684d2fde", "s2:09806c3b252d1c26f69ce54214a6bd688f0e5f9c", "s2:c27078d60737ea10e8ca4f05acd114fef29c8276", "s2:756eded65bf7b2946db9353df75bb6ef7dfeb6a5", "s2:e17c4fb5aa9f448066eed074ae13b0b5e8d30072", "s2:9e8b35e2a7b74653c98e60f0203acaaf9edb38a7", "s2:e1d3f7eb3bf11a0881d9417df8071ca663eefbaf", "s2:6963e063889f1143c47afe80adda00bc98736e1a", "s2:3a68afefa50d6a7893fe0a9efdf125b7dcb0e7dc", "s2:f81be7f4e75cbef796f7c3ccd89b0ad80f455e20", "s2:754b657330b1674d3453e8254d3a664db5222b3b", "s2:282a380fb5ac26d99667224cef8c630f6882704f", "s2:3e18c12b778ca082cd943d297758b42664ceed5e", "s2:26561f99e3538188f0282d111e9330f1ea1d9f91", "s2:1167284323636b54ae07a7a7fac388215c583fbb", "s2:580da103f67bbe7fbb39f65c96f13caa7de33c7b", "s2:57620e357ee348cd5ffa8eafa480e002a2aba06a", "s2:e61cd652bb9536cff06ce48db8ce934614201ec7", "s2:2be81316d28b3683d388b951c8bb147ab2f61fcc", "s2:a5b50170e7270d20c03fed29602f1fccf4552965", "s2:3a2f1d03de15f6580420f539f73981599a7a7ad3", "s2:1695ff30aa141088a019fc29df6d128d6add06f5", "s2:4f62827b1ff578fc5ead8587d03679ea01b72a0f", "s2:ed45289373e79467b06a9a57a866293df7eb2da3", "s2:e56730fc445effd194dc6690b061ccc2fa5b9b5b", "s2:e5d53eee2d3b2fb13bfe0a4730f9f6756555d6c6", "s2:56b942af4e0a595a66228c7141b96489a72b71d2", "s2:e1cb36d6209638b9478ed01e7944022a6dba06d1", "s2:5907a990b9e78aa8572a24329e74721e60bece70", "s2:312f6b7dbf8306c2c03b1e938636cab5924f3e86", "s2:33224ad0cdf6e2dc4893194dd587309c7887f0ba", "s2:2910ee0ac40abb61dbdd0d38861129a54eae5070", "s2:b2dece1eb593c189a5f81a93ff2c26439d123c45", "s2:1ed6a4a10589618d4f26350f1a296ee767ceff6b", "s2:5e07da2914783a21980ecc1cea688d1333e6b6e4", "s2:4a183dcdba1dcd6c9dc5a814aee137761c75e135", "s2:38befc225304024b15ac43e867b90418ca138f8a", "s2:e8077729ef723d71a0b7492f2f271ae413b5a4d5", "s2:bf15128e48db7aaa9146328d965fc81dbdf4db3f", "s2:687a644c897982bd3348901917f88be4b6fa1257", "s2:7033a4e5775684734eb22be87c5d72caa06983a3", "s2:767ed9b4c974411b46c445bd3e235515760ecc65", "s2:431bc727175e273a4a8fa6b34c9b36ea41e2a594", "s2:58c1fa6847d4495b873ba834b47e5eb843461080", "s2:2e68872ece8bef1244d8b234419da89100d98920", "s2:ffa191a2b9e08c523747fd9be521eb60ceb19ca9", "s2:0e58fd8dd01ef4e8484875c2a64e3839d3d92fa2", "s2:9e5e4952c07f0be23343501f74f2f3ba964005ab", "s2:63539280f9edbb56dd3acd63ed5fd85a61fb1861", "s2:0fdd66fcf6b9bc04428e337df66fd510a659eb2f", "s2:4f1046f538fac7b9181b1c27a66223d7d031da7b", "s2:fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "An Active Inference Model of Covert and Overt Visual Attention", "abstract": "The ability to selectively attend to relevant stimuli while filtering out distractions is essential for agents that process complex, high-dimensional sensory input. This paper introduces a model of covert and overt visual attention through the framework of active inference, utilizing dynamic optimization of sensory precisions to minimize free-energy. The model determines visual sensory precisions based on both current environmental beliefs and sensory input, influencing attentional allocation in both covert and overt modalities. To test the effectiveness of the model, we analyze its behavior in the Posner cueing task and a simple target focus task using two-dimensional(2D) visual data. Reaction times are measured to investigate the interplay between exogenous and endogenous attention, as well as valid and invalid cueing. The results show that exogenous and valid cues generally lead to faster reaction times compared to endogenous and invalid cues. Furthermore, the model exhibits behavior similar to inhibition of return, where previously attended locations become suppressed after a specific cue-target onset asynchrony interval. Lastly, we investigate different aspects of overt attention and show that involuntary, reflexive saccades occur faster than intentional ones, but at the expense of adaptability.", "authors": [{"name": "Tin Misic", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Karlo Koledi'c", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Fabio Bonsignorio", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Ivan Petrović", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Ivan Marković", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2025, "doi": "10.48550/arXiv.2505.03856", "arxiv_id": "2505.03856", "s2_id": "d660cba63e3dd60b3e4231e933cccd6f8429737a", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "arXiv.org", "citation_count": 0, "references": ["s2:7d2c9ef77c1b23e79b8aaff93ccfd94b22c5756b", "s2:2b9156e4618d31c850ec3522cdc3941d249ee79a", "s2:3bd24d6a3287543603e8826a1e219bbe44756538", "s2:fba770ba16ea8a62125703017229775ad6d89310", "s2:46924699ccba70793ad32d281692c2a5897d9bb4", "s2:f093c343638dc8d81a2349b724e3a045a8744dfc", "s2:53a27755c69b8482758877750a66bb5c8155f9b9", "s2:a2d4729fc4ef8217822a88e99605489bbaebb58d", "s2:37dc2cad77586816d2a0490dc6876cf02bb285a5", "s2:185b7f3c6fe8e647ae9c79fbb463768b64c59a52", "s2:1ec6904705256e1609125da591875adf9afae8b5", "s2:15f38e0424fcd4e5ce8dfa00593f76fdb92e09b7", "s2:9d01596fa15e3a9c5cf2e42b2c53784917488f1e", "s2:8e114ccd0c3f44c4933ee03c656abad40e35e43e", "s2:a9019d2e50b81585081d0fb20cf3a4ac06e1210e", "s2:3b08af33a7646a88f393f384c24d95627dfe9bfd", "s2:dde0ce895c3e31ed9e15cb9960b3f1f71e676af1", "s2:1ed6a4a10589618d4f26350f1a296ee767ceff6b", "s2:6e867512de51250e7bb90a9beb0c6b0113203f58", "s2:641a9d87b9636d4ef2e353a569ddede68bd29131", "s2:aebd8bab5cff769fed204dba35112e364a47e504", "s2:53e66b6934516a9859573f4866f81f04bce977ae", "s2:96a76e9d28adeae651a79fb9299f4d314eb304da", "s2:7cc4c4874a2194f25fff0c00d5aaf83acff007f1", "s2:b9e465aea9a62e73d87ba782057ce1ae5af432ab", "s2:75a7931e3de0a05a3a71021fde66d71a68247bcf", "s2:5087cd05412e01b52ac889060d25c71760b97640", "s2:7fa35bebace830c9c3740bad4cfe3b0ad25e8d75", "s2:bc6be797ff4cdcd62b13dd563ba508e0ae82bbb6", "s2:167e8ccf51c382d4f85b38728203388ae283f882", "s2:e7105c408ee590ded6b360bfe743005f015cfb7f"], "publication_date": null}

AIDE formulates the evaluation problem as variational inference in a latent dynamical system, enabling joint treatment of representation, temporal structure, and predictive reasoning. The framework integrates (i) a representation and augmentation module based on variational learning and contrastive semantic encoding, (ii) a parametric state–space model that captures the evolution of latent states and supports probabilistic forecasting, and (iii) a policy-selection mechanism that minimizes the expected free energy, guiding a latent diffusion generator to produce coherent and interpretable evaluation outputs. This formulation yields a principled pipeline linking evidence accumulation, latent-state inference, and policy-driven generative reporting.

The exploitative drive, or what an agent wants to achieve, is formalised as the Kullback-Leibler divergence between a variational probability distribution, updated at each inference step, and a preference probability distribution that indicates what states or observations are more likely for the agent, hence determining the agent's goal in a certain environment. In the literature, the questions of how the preference distribution should be specified and of how a certain specification impacts inference and learning in an active inference agent have been given hardly any attention. In this work, we consider four possible ways of defining the preference distribution, either providing the agents with hard or soft goals and either involving or not goal shaping (i.e., intermediate goals). We compare the performances of four agents, each given one of the possible preference distributions, in a grid world navigation task. Our results show that goal shaping enables the best performance overall (i.e., it promotes exploitation) while sacrificing learning about the environment's transition dynamics (i.e., it hampers exploration).", "authors": [{"name": "Filippo Torresan", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Ryota Kanai", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Manuel Baltieri", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2025, "doi": "10.48550/arXiv.2512.03293", "arxiv_id": "2512.03293", "s2_id": "9c15d4067eb7edfc764fb41acc9d7783214dd223", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "arXiv.org", "citation_count": 0, "references": ["s2:ad11188a450d44e987370b3fe23f49c7693724e7", "s2:04c23ac20d792471905fc36b0a0e5a361b16e887", "s2:f42ecbdb6e91b1328b2f95171811d25cc2c7461a", "s2:0d598b16582e344ee621f469787af85b467c78a8", "s2:dded71d2681fb42c1d149286b636b066ab6a0910", "s2:abbef3f050f2381c88fbd4dd8a7818d9ba989b38", "s2:5f4f196fc6277185d85816501bb814dfaeed69e4", "s2:d2d107630f062018ddc806798811cdb0e293ec78", "s2:8be55833180ec2d2fa3a0ad8f632a4e7aa2aa8d0", "s2:adc4df3c3c5bfaecb5510cf97da0d441938f5ab9", "s2:778349c7a1702f16586a0a2fed2840862c9100d5", "s2:1eecf3b4255909953a2a8973411ea47ce8d054a6", "s2:2d366c82e84b24b1ac0302dc349275f44359a435", "s2:931781af3b6797d5abe3aa2537f4f46fd4fdf3ef", "s2:5f14c55724f4b12e91ad2e182deee876ae2b9411", "s2:67c6eb9de9aab00ee4e8da7c83a47899f0205ae8", "s2:2d04c6e50e6334593131ec23c9ffcae1ae706229", "s2:25ffa86f4dd81b3795d39f1a0caa957c39bc40b3", "s2:d17c6cb9c0d8ec64ce8d1eff653ac72b15df683a", "s2:a934a3a7f171d494556a80d31f7bf4b637376c71", "s2:a951a731ef3ab06f3961a6ffabf49249fae32cae", "s2:6417d1bfc8f7dc8df7b04e50f8eb9188784b776a", "s2:def8207fb6457f3c2656bac9f2bbf954de1d7de1", "s2:b7f49e65d1c558d46763ed5c8e72de1d37500706", "s2:cb42e9061caa1600a8b317f86bfc24169cd152f2", "s2:1670b8904f2309b9568c294f9a10f75681768e17", "s2:6ecc4b1ab05f3ec12484a0ea36abfd6271c5c5ba", "s2:e07a66d2b115c802a2f9e1a2db3a728afec5daff", "s2:1c167b1ce9928d46259937bb13dbc2c6ef7aed8f", "s2:dc8fb699df3504befcdf4037fb625d81f08a2876", "s2:754b657330b1674d3453e8254d3a664db5222b3b", "s2:92a32ea6bcb702ce64a3e15dfdd3f2638fcf241d", "s2:c469f8a7f02015bc49e93df26c396228267a7e7b", "s2:144c0b5884627366546ecbf06e1f6e5a56ebbc56", "s2:bfb33c01461fe622c2f44f147822e95cea6fa5d0", "s2:f3ba5b8e81eb4fe8fe5b381a65fd1003cd25d451", "s2:5e07da2914783a21980ecc1cea688d1333e6b6e4", "s2:a878886efacc6a5d742bf98bfc25c0734ce502b1", "s2:1a014a076cac3c7f5d81a084e296c095f9230437", "s2:8fcbc38e7196b0dc8748f04cd6101e71f92c158e", "s2:5042cb5efad30f443adef472b8748e1b7bb0452f", "s2:9d8f6219fbd2da14d8d55562dcedf43fe671d0e3", "s2:31ce515c018890a1cfa6d91bd68b5b0859768f80", "s2:0fdd66fcf6b9bc04428e337df66fd510a659eb2f", "s2:3283c36cd5c0b4a38237d182516570d7d1f0f550", "s2:4f1046f538fac7b9181b1c27a66223d7d031da7b", "s2:d125b9e7bea779f2c6b2e71c65ce358eb4265d06", "s2:97efafdb4a3942ab3efba53ded7413199f79c054", "s2:9c422194b1c7cc8b6c001929305ecf98ee4e4360"], "publication_date": null}

{"title": "Stabilizing the Convergence of Pixel-Based Deep Active Inference Controllers Using Adaptive Smoothing Filters", "abstract": "In recent years, active inference has gained attention in robot control owing to its adaptability to environmental changes. However, its reliance on gradient descent of variational free energy offers no guarantee of convergence to an optimal solution. In this study, we propose an approach that applies a smoothing filter to a pixel-based active inference controller to mitigate the risk of local minima. By smoothing the observed, predicted, and target values, the free energy function becomes smoother, yielding a broader distribution of gradients toward the target, thereby reducing the risk of being trapped in the local minima. In addition, in order to prevent excessive smoothing from eliminating the gradient of the free energy function, we also proposed a method for dynamically adjusting the intensity of smoothing based on prediction and target errors. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we applied it to two simulation environments: a simple object-tracking task using a 3-degrees-of-freedom camera, and a robot control task using a 2-degrees-of-freedom robotic arm, and compared it with the conventional active inference controller as a baseline. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves improved convergence performance over the conventional method.", "authors": [{"name": "Kazuma Nagatsuka", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Kyo Kutsuzawa", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Dai Owaki", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "M.

{"title": "Deep Active Inference with Generative Actions and Diversity-Based Action Choice", "abstract": "The literature of Deep Active Inference, implementing the generative, biologically inspired Active Inference framework with the Deep Learning approach, often makes use of a hidden state transition model to generate current hidden states. It also usually leverages the Monte Carlo family methods to choose the agent's next action that minimizes the Expected Free Energy. The action identification typically uses either a stochastic sampling process or a learning of sampled actions by a ‘habit’ model. In this work, the goal is to explore an approach based on the learning and generation of actions as a result of hidden state transitions. The corresponding generative model, along with the variational form of the Free Energy and the Expected Free Energy, are formulated for an environment represented as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process, and the model architecture is also presented. We also suggest a novel approach for the action choice: the generated action minimizing the Expected Free Energy is chosen based on the diversity of the expected risk relatively to that of its originating action set. The Active Inference agent is also equipped with top-down, selective, context-dependent attention mechanisms to control its behavior. Experiments have been conducted by addressing the continuous versions of Mountain Car and Inverted Pendulum problems. The results show the ability of the agent to learn and solve both problems with promising performance, requiring noticeable changes only on high-level attention parameters.

However, the dynamic and uncertain nature of edge computing-enabled networks, characterized by fluctuating topologies, bandwidth, and resources, significantly complicates migration decisions.

This paper proposes a novel service migration strategy driven by active inference for edge computing-enabled networks. Unlike traditional approaches, it eliminates the need for explicit reward functions, instead leveraging a cognitive optimization mechanism where decisions are guided by minimizing free energy. This allows the system to maintain efficient service migration across a wider range of edge scenarios, with enhanced generalization and flexibility.

{"title": "Working Memory and Self-Directed Inner Speech Enhance Multitask Generalization in Active Inference.", "abstract": "This simulation study shows how a set of working memory tasks can be acquired simultaneously through interaction between a stacked recurrent neural network (RNN) and multiple working memories. In these tasks, temporal patterns are provided, followed by linguistically specified task goals. Training is performed in a supervised manner by minimizing the free energy, and goal-directed tasks are performed using the active inference (AIF) framework. Our simulation results show that the best task performance is obtained when two working memory modules are used instead of one or none and when self-directed inner speech is incorporated during task execution. Detailed analysis indicates that a temporal hierarchy develops in the stacked RNN module under these optimal conditions. We argue that the model's capacity for generalization across novel task configurations is supported by the structured interplay between working memory and the generation of self-directed language outputs during task execution. This interplay promotes internal representations that reflect task structure, which in turn support generalization by enabling a functional separation between content encoding and control dynamics within the memory architecture.", "authors": [{"name": "J.

{"title": "What the flock knows that the birds do not: exploring the emergence of joint agency in multi-agent active inference", "abstract": "Collective behavior pervades biological systems, from flocks of birds to neural assemblies and human societies. Yet, how such collectives acquire functional properties -- such as joint agency or knowledge -- that transcend those of their individual components remains an open question. Here, we combine active inference and information-theoretic analyses to explore how a minimal system of interacting agents can give rise to joint agency and collective knowledge. We model flocking dynamics using multiple active inference agents, each minimizing its own free energy while coupling reciprocally with its neighbors. We show that as agents self-organize, their interactions define higher-order statistical boundaries (Markov blankets) enclosing a ``flock''that can be treated as an emergent agent with its own sensory, active, and internal states. When exposed to external perturbations (a ``predator''), the flock exhibits faster, coordinated responses than individual agents, reflecting collective sensitivity to environmental change. Crucially, analyses of synergistic information reveal that the flock encodes information about the predator's location that is not accessible to every individual bird, demonstrating implicit collective knowledge. Together, these results show how informational coupling among active inference agents can generate new levels of autonomy and inference, providing a framework for understanding the emergence of (implicit) collective knowledge and joint agency.", "authors": [{"name": "Domenico Maisto", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Davide Nuzzi", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Giovanni Pezzulo", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2025, "doi": "10.48550/arXiv.2511.10835", "arxiv_id": "2511.10835", "s2_id": "3baf4cc2c870a2e88df1b7969bed4750f45ba59f", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "arXiv.org", "citation_count": 0, "references": ["s2:3317e7e2d20d840e146d4c175fe27728d5bcbc8a", "s2:d1f9032d66b0245b3469a4a416a8249b8fa40d8b", "s2:7439a2790daa39539ffd80f56e0e0c49a16a7792", "s2:fe1a1d46fd8289fffefe2038a371c9d28f322cb3", "s2:268d241ed873d83cf2d92b5783fe31c27fad37a6", "s2:b54a4ae867526ea6eb6e00e19646da3352839b8a", "s2:b10059450eb8c07d2fb62122bbd139607e0ffe89", "s2:9c87c3f77a9bd3c98ace43b04fb19ebb0483dcf2", "s2:eb1eba02687f000ed61f1395a5c737a504d32580", "s2:dded71d2681fb42c1d149286b636b066ab6a0910", "s2:ef64e8c681f06911b6754bd4836a197a5b110a28", "s2:5278a8eb2ba2429d4029745caf4e661080073c81", "s2:12a83c962877f50a6f3bea64c8a06fa761af3bc6", "s2:9741de745d4dcc5ef13e33d164e8eaaa2bbe8d22", "s2:f4e5125837a7ae3eb20e9f55ecad2dc63c450f8c", "s2:51cb188e53f8a8bc51cd7a671391d3ad5adfb8e2", "s2:22b704567b7941a828bc650a88e625cbf274d38d", "s2:05b0f2ad7740052491d65e8224a166f903c4ba61", "s2:d902addb2f8ebd3a47533ffe2e264635d169441f", "s2:248b15c7f9bfd37d25db115efe75ed556120eca6", "s2:483c23b1401b65b838de06df7b4f30a4f05b1504", "s2:9f6af14a2501752f7404e156a3241a000093646a", "s2:dea66ec3415990252be06932a2de31a49ba85365", "s2:0cfe84f85de736e0ff725c7d7227cea393bd40eb", "s2:6043480abba84c0a339ad821369ad2148b0a4f56", "s2:953ef5583a97e7a812ffb8aa0dc9f3ec52e0fd9c", "s2:77efd9d280fdacb29c0e4ddfbfa5ba09e789c765", "s2:8cce37b29eead21747638c9db7ce03d55549997b", "s2:8b77b7593db1c484ac5cd9e876370b35dd61ff48", "s2:185324a6686f498797b0aae158ac95970bfb8fcf", "s2:56af8c1ab23f04afb78d907d44d255985304fa0b", "s2:f1da83d2a7bb4fd6ef5ce5228f12da0e5c8d9c92", "s2:e1d3f7eb3bf11a0881d9417df8071ca663eefbaf", "s2:11f8956e33eabba2fc80398ac0498b79bd0faeeb", "s2:88881530ae8b2577bae7cae0defd9a26a9a1e8dc", "s2:44749d507b5d6b8060abbc488835201fa7724007", "s2:af1e3356714bc053e4613390cd573a79a93f4cf6", "s2:423cfbabb1e37610a3db01300cbf3a69886cab26", "s2:49692225655c3a8b1bc495b7e250defe5aa76c11", "s2:f6b20a4c30a1319c69b6b3c9fa11783b7f9ba73d", "s2:dfcda130de8a8057e9ca0aef8a4a082cdf341b09", "s2:2c13294ccc0045d24fe0ae01a5ff6dd21d0566d1", "s2:26d237f76ec2ef59d5df02adb8d0b0fa45223680", "s2:fe6ffb82e465478b347808ab2af729791fba5b71", "s2:df9c9607a2d439fe4fc128b3b29dcd38ed3303c9", "s2:460e6bd950e40f7e4aa3957797757e4d2aefaf54", "s2:aca9703c193cb440caf5ee3efd4ca8d74b51b7f5", "s2:2aa71514e0885368c73fcbe8ba3bbd31119e79b1", "s2:9d91dead9612e1c6a8dd9ae3793fe697565c744e", "s2:132d5c5e8e2af9934b8b889de5a39f3a5ff655a3", "s2:ed52bad7abdc9468e35b8be304609bf9690347d3", "s2:87c75ff29d956034f8f0a951e370b693addb165d", "s2:8a244243bcedb8c0adffee62dd5454a5b492f653", "s2:175602dd006420073d172f0c5dd3fbc2a3704c4d", "s2:c85fa1d222a5847a97e385046497d5e2a6d98dba", "s2:42b3626ec3baa1f5f06bc1773db96fcbd419db48", "s2:123b18feab79d9cf235fc273f4c1c1542551b3da", "s2:3840fedf8386793418aadab065cb503b19483154", "s2:0b90ae1359dd4802c1ca37f81d10bcbbd2bcb04e", "s2:7a5dc9efa155a31b9536296feb00251946a63e69", "s2:dd1543f2d39a2eeadc739b1a0537508e22019183", "s2:a688985fd094fd8fabc2f0a6a91c5de35150e993", "s2:0551bb0a149aaa866c0030500b7b30eead56014f", "s2:9e2adb51f289a816dbc99a9910f21ed2f89113ff", "s2:c4688cf894ddc7b274aca0819f3386785e38f6f7", "s2:7f877e8b42c2a0ef210edff65f572dd43b2e00a8", "s2:885434ab65d4c01bea5ac1d4f3d196044bc0ce71", "s2:fee623ce8cb964a53cc1849007758aa5a32490b7", "s2:062ded64ece4ff6f8c239dc0e2c575d35d429532", "s2:08ae739bdaf076355b3c6f3b55ac46214ff7fa58", "s2:5bb0a465697ca39e03319bc6864a6c936a7720d1", "s2:1be3feeb17c3520fbac6b5b652aa41feea596b2f", "s2:38e298647030ab32b7be33b44951d7e54cfb8091", "s2:cba0c4e92736bb1c0380c4b2f5b77548cf9aad71", "s2:18aa8a0502e717c114312a3ba63dbb76fbcab47c", "s2:0eddafecdcbe210b799c1a295f02eab50a393cfd", "s2:0800357049444fb80588f264d68e0c23f9b12a19", "s2:b46f0914b3e0266b0fe9c073d24e3d10c09268ff", "s2:66d915a91e77e9dabdd0df410038f01192d82a06", "s2:180d21b7852d4c5a2d8f724410ecde80ff4d529f", "s2:b5eab7f068892648ea558884d41226fff26e28ff", "s2:e676916093c326f6854b185fc81155900891df47", "s2:32378b6239f90c6a25d25c8d630e525d7336c42a", "s2:cfd3f3da5eecf44137503e4f4f4fb02eef1c3aea", "s2:31b6f5e0f7b1d4b0d22e812eadca08c6b12c6a5e", "s2:58b8dded611b7ca2667e92cd795fe1c01677300e", "s2:7abcc4de0eeadfce4caaa067919aa32cdd56920c", "s2:167136806b3a4234b76ba97515310360f7d57a71", "s2:d71729fe4bc4b5e3c43c3b22b0d50f0148c5d936", "s2:32b5178547b79d384afad2c7abb6c64f1697617c"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Zero-shot Structure Learning and Planning for Autonomous Robot Navigation using Active Inference", "abstract": "Autonomous navigation in unfamiliar environments requires robots to simultaneously explore, localise, and plan under uncertainty, without relying on predefined maps or extensive training. We present a biologically inspired, Active Inference-based framework, Active Inference MAPping and Planning (AIMAPP). This model unifies mapping, localisation, and decision-making within a single generative model. Inspired by hippocampal navigation, it uses topological reasoning, place-cell encoding, and episodic memory to guide behaviour. The agent builds and updates a sparse topological map online, learns state transitions dynamically, and plans actions by minimising Expected Free Energy. This allows it to balance goal-directed and exploratory behaviours. We implemented a ROS-compatible navigation system that is sensor and robot-agnostic, capable of integrating with diverse hardware configurations. It operates in a fully self-supervised manner, is resilient to drift, and supports both exploration and goal-directed navigation without any pre-training. We demonstrate robust performance in large-scale real and simulated environments against state-of-the-art planning models, highlighting the system's adaptability to ambiguous observations, environmental changes, and sensor noise. The model offers a biologically inspired, modular solution to scalable, self-supervised navigation in unstructured settings.

{"title": "Forgetting ourselves in flow: an active inference account of flow states and how we experience ourselves within them", "abstract": "Flow has been described as a state of optimal performance, experienced universally across a broad range of domains: from art to athletics, gaming to writing. However, its phenomenal characteristics can, at first glance, be puzzling. Firstly, individuals in flow supposedly report a loss of self-awareness, even though they perform in a manner which seems to evince their agency and skill. Secondly, flow states are felt to be effortless, despite the prerequisite complexity of the tasks that engender them. In this paper, we unpick these features of flow, as well as others, through the active inference framework, which posits that action and perception are forms of active Bayesian inference directed at sustained self-organisation; i.e., the minimisation of variational free energy. We propose that the phenomenology of flow is rooted in the deployment of high precision weight over (i) the expected sensory consequences of action and (ii) beliefs about how action will sequentially unfold. This computational mechanism thus draws the embodied cognitive system to minimise the ensuing (i.e., expected) free energy through the exploitation of the pragmatic affordances at hand. Furthermore, given the challenging dynamics the flow-inducing situation presents, attention must be wholly focussed on the unfolding task whilst counterfactual planning is restricted, leading to the attested loss of the sense of self-as-object. This involves the inhibition of both the sense of self as a temporally extended object and higher–order, meta-cognitive forms of self-conceptualisation. Nevertheless, we stress that self-awareness is not entirely lost in flow. Rather, it is pre-reflective and bodily. Our approach to bodily-action-centred phenomenology can be applied to similar facets of seemingly agentive experience beyond canonical flow states, providing insights into the mechanisms of so-called selfless experiences, embodied expertise and wellbeing.", "authors": [{"name": "Darius Parvizi-Wayne", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Lars Sandved-Smith", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "R.

{"title": "Computational enactivism under the free energy principle", "abstract": "In this paper, I argue that enactivism and computationalism—two seemingly incompatible research traditions in modern cognitive science—can be fruitfully reconciled under the framework of the free energy principle (FEP). FEP holds that cognitive systems encode generative models of their niches and cognition can be understood in terms of minimizing the free energy of these models. There are two philosophical interpretations of this picture. A computationalist will argue that as FEP claims that Bayesian inference underpins both perception and action, it entails a concept of cognition as a computational process. An enactivist, on the other hand, will point out that FEP explains cognitive systems as constantly self-organizing to non-equilibrium steady-state. My claim is that these two interpretations are both true at the same time and that they enlighten each other.", "authors": [{"name": "Tomasz Korbak", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2019, "doi": "10.1007/s11229-019-02243-4", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": "e1c587f35c1b2737a5119b75473db2e404ba6e4a", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "Synthese", "citation_count": 24, "references": ["s2:767929661ff234087c54483a933333355b4630db", "s2:6e7b864f4e04b58597a2f77ad61c74245f5cebed", "s2:e4aa66404b5787b6596ad788f940892c120e873f", "s2:b9ce50d697fe3346f7d254236ab7f2aa52636411", "s2:10f4b877867bd6061733cc0b9625dd4af5e0c117", "s2:0d3e7e3c068013f1727de99edc1997a941f80243", "s2:31638dec29f9720efd83665bf882c4ae53914c71", "s2:52f0e3a695ccdd904f7b5d01c0d18e1c0b44fd8c", "s2:4bda1f4c423724a7d0a270d833943d9b38e6e4e6", "s2:e1d3f7eb3bf11a0881d9417df8071ca663eefbaf", "s2:7fe4c3a005b2b5a8925798a20abb0df5f7ef3a5e", "s2:15d9b37059f4607e2fa986335daf72ae5aea6e57", "s2:754b657330b1674d3453e8254d3a664db5222b3b", "s2:e1330c3914ba3e5ba5149ff73ad5fb3c45ab4f41", "s2:165a323d122fd1a7d625f7bc0f4a4c5a0a116d72", "s2:cbf4040cb14a019ff3556fad5c455e99737f169f", "s2:63c8cce4f76fb42c1f4a4952af95141db345eb14", "s2:fefd06873a43ee7ba203f85e159f43a7f5d9ca81", "s2:49b21c235f022da6ee4bdabe7fae4e85459b265c", "s2:d923112dbf3c46d792b9d1172dd8fa69a68e3386", "s2:3dfcbeae610bd51d52a0449339224bf8bde45f8c", "s2:42abde7800c25b90ec1bb9c88dfbe2ab37e5ae16", "s2:9ddfcd5a252f2323ac783d07368b63fcccad663e", "s2:802dba92bda8c764ffcb508f24e4c4968d5e8f1f", "s2:2c13294ccc0045d24fe0ae01a5ff6dd21d0566d1", "s2:57620e357ee348cd5ffa8eafa480e002a2aba06a", "s2:d1fbdd893afbb8abb1b3bae72565b70b4292510c", "s2:8c9fe711bdd1f33645bd1104e84c25c8a51e04c2", "s2:f625fe4489231f56f4dcdbca043f74695784ba5a", "s2:5da99429fdf2d7501c74616eca857de9022f9ecf", "s2:300bd9d51cf7d27d6147ae102bd6bb0974a21702", "s2:2ba788647916f6206f7fcc137fe7866c58e6211e", "s2:073dc236ad2712732891fc7fe847058c9d5f9bcf", "s2:d3725475292b96c00488274858eda742dc6fe9dc", "s2:aad3d8bb0fdc938ff3bacea482008480ff732dd0", "s2:ff2fcad7794d3953bfbcb5c9c7e671da350ab622", "s2:abdbb815188a8461772828e6136edd1b8c9c05a3", "s2:5c97ce0dde81d63e834385e675d718785ed7ac7b", "s2:e7cf658031f579681621681b4eae48d5eaffd21e", "s2:348d4d282ba8b55cfae5d94de2392f8934a0b7c7", "s2:1a317ab20f1a1f59143fa1c7992162ec5fe8e83e", "s2:27ae9cdab1fbf96e31f834c6ff3e24f936bc853f", "s2:668b1277fbece28c4841eeab1c97e4ebd0079700", "s2:e360851e9c527057ced0f63c264b931382dd2c29", "s2:30808ce8fb040c4e27e5d150db670de09e837ad5", "s2:c07ab049d23ff6643acbdc7597bffeb243af15c7", "s2:b1235d9bfce81de9ae39fed3092efc1a9358e905", "s2:aa7dc14720c56119aa85d154ad954d047e348906", "s2:674bee628d75596ff0d5c25151a5662da4e393e3", "s2:c7d879a4ac0871ce1b2dca28241badf9988d568b", "s2:e462de9cb9481b5793f0b6e62211594a0a4c2e97", "s2:45ba21a0590e2885691cee9d5a0cc0887d3753b8", "s2:a9f11102afcfbef68b4bd1ddefd5e29236283b0a", "s2:b8a54527440299cef7ebd85274b30199b7fd85c5", "s2:bca98303fcc3ef7d8b482ad23712f6e26c2140cb", "s2:a5e9b096f3c258a26412f8b9d596087a97c96996", "s2:0fdd66fcf6b9bc04428e337df66fd510a659eb2f", "s2:92e0f59b64a0c8cab1a8b4a5bebb41fad58c7866", "s2:7c50308f748fc5a954e903c53cfdfd18c3ab0291", "s2:6603e85b16c0ed9663ced0684313a6bc5b505d6d", "s2:a6a1c412a788806cba794a5cfdf2acbf0443290f", "s2:b5878f592f8b57c9f11933a8db61d6619bbab358", "s2:cbf390aa3ddc5bdad679725c7899f05aa4c1e654", "s2:302f0b0ef664649c3c3134c6bf73fb59f93fbfd5", "s2:27d87ef98b90a65620dab5bacfdaa3c64223b545", "s2:a8e794d9979085c158b501f27edac48669af3793", "s2:62064218665ad89f0cb2a44f5b19f7703d9c7e71", "s2:9e0187963d86a0112a50eaf5046f94a4bd3ecd81", "s2:6feef7c8678bd1d951f6adc923a1e1041b6cfe90", "s2:41b7a1870b582ce4be675dae5ab0ed0b3f036641", "s2:aa85b64099467cee73694933aef7a6d6fc863ea4", "s2:de39028ea1122d09649a42b12e04c8f349ebe8a6", "s2:ef10c9d9a66c8b093f98984267670de9aeed809b"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "A Message Passing Realization of Expected Free Energy Minimization", "abstract": "We present a message passing approach to Expected Free Energy (EFE) minimization on factor graphs, based on the theory introduced in arXiv:2504.14898. By reformulating EFE minimization as Variational Free Energy minimization with epistemic priors, we transform a combinatorial search problem into a tractable inference problem solvable through standard variational techniques. Applying our message passing method to factorized state-space models enables efficient policy inference. We evaluate our method on environments with epistemic uncertainty: a stochastic gridworld and a partially observable Minigrid task. Agents using our approach consistently outperform conventional KL-control agents on these tasks, showing more robust planning and efficient exploration under uncertainty. In the stochastic gridworld environment, EFE-minimizing agents avoid risky paths, while in the partially observable minigrid setting, they conduct more systematic information-seeking.

{"title": "Allostasis, interoception, and the free energy principle: Feeling our way forward", "abstract": "Interoceptive processing is commonly understood in terms of the monitoring and representation of the body’s current physiological (i.e. homeostatic) status, with aversive sensory experiences encoding some impending threat to tissue viability. However, claims that homeostasis fails to fully account for the sophisticated regulatory dynamics observed in complex organisms have led some theorists to incorporate predictive (i.e. allostatic) regulatory mechanisms within broader accounts of interoceptive processing. Critically, these frameworks invoke diverse—and potentially mutually inconsistent—interpretations of the role allostasis plays in the scheme of biological regulation. This chapter argues in favor of a moderate, reconciliatory position in which homeostasis and allostasis are conceived as equally vital (but functionally distinct) modes of physiological control. It explores the implications of this interpretation for free energy-based accounts of interoceptive inference, advocating a similarly complementary (and hierarchical) view of homeostatic and allostatic processing.", "authors": [{"name": "Andrew W.

{"title": "How preferences enslave attention: calling into question the endogenous/exogenous dichotomy from an active inference perspective", "abstract": "It is easy to think of attention as a purely sensorimotor, exogenous mechanism divorced from the influence of an agent’s preferences and needs. However, according to the active inference framework, such a strict reduction cannot be straightforwardly invoked, since all cognitive and behavioural processes can at least be described as maximising the evidence for a generative model entailed by the ongoing existence of that agent; that is, the minimisation of variational free energy. As such, active inference models could cast an (embodied) cognitive mechanism like attention, described in this paper as a relevance filter, as constrained (or enslaved) by these prior preferences for which an agent must seek evidence, whether or not such priors are having direct, real-time neurocognitive effects on the sensorimotor loops that couple the attending agent and her surrounding environment. This duality with respect to the role of priors corresponds to a wider, ongoing debate in the active inference community regarding the framework’s explanatory power. More specifically, the debate centres on whether the notion of a generative model and the priors embedded ubiqitously therein act as a purely useful instrumental tool for scientists aiming to model the behaviours of self-organising entities, or, rather, the brain (and body) is genuinely constituted by a predictive hierarchy within which higher-order dynamics constrain and contextualise activity unfolding at lower levels. With a focus on the second (ontologically realist) construal of active inference presented here, this paper argues that in cognitive systems endowed with attentional schema, higher-order preferences do, indeed, impose a demonstrable and powerful modulating effect on the way attention unfolds. Furthermore, these preferences in question transcend the contingent, task-relevant goals that have already been shown to bias attention. Rather, attention is powerfully tuned by the most-deep rooted priors the agent possesses, such that, when sensory evidence against these priors is observed and free energy spikes, the agent attentionally prioritises the homeostatic restoration of these preferred states over their shorter-term desires. This suggests that, at its core, attention is a goal-driven process, which calls into question the putative dichotomy that exists between endogenous (goal-directed) attention and exogenous (stimulus-driven) attention. What emerges in its place is a symbiotic relationship between attention and preferences, whereby the fulfilment of the latter rests on successful application of the former, and the former derives its function from the organismic need to find evidence for the latter.", "authors": [{"name": "Darius Parvizi-Wayne", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2024, "doi":

{"title": "Making the Thermodynamic Cost of Active Inference Explicit", "abstract": "When describing Active Inference Agents (AIAs), the term “energy” can have two distinct meanings. One is the energy that is utilized by the AIA (e.g., electrical energy or chemical energy). The second meaning is so-called Variational Free Energy (VFE), a statistical quantity which provides an upper bound on surprisal. In this paper, we develop an account of the former quantity—the Thermodynamic Free Energy (TFE)—and its relationship with the latter. We highlight the necessary tradeoffs between these two in a generic, quantum information-theoretic formulation, and the macroscopic consequences of those tradeoffs for the ways that organisms approach their environments. By making this tradeoff explicit, we provide a theoretical basis for the different metabolic strategies that organisms from plants to predators use to survive.", "authors": [{"name": "Chris Fields", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Adam Goldstein", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Lars Sandved-Smith", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2024, "doi": "10.3390/e26080622", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": "4c0ab43865bfcf89ba88bc4b87a07b137eafe54b", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "Entropy", "citation_count": 8, "references": ["s2:85f5d51261ad527ee4c535259daf9a63f5ff44b9", "s2:eebd77b8b3516da9b6d479a1a355e64205c05b1b", "s2:db2aa516203656c55efc7343b0a5b34a81a610bb", "s2:c5919327d94883e86d1c24b055c341f6640bfc17", "s2:69591e97373b37683da16a52d610eea7c931f532", "s2:51cb188e53f8a8bc51cd7a671391d3ad5adfb8e2", "s2:f13a2f9d6e37038286a4fd18a25c9a4447e664c6", "s2:0a39ebdd67aa2cd8d448b129c2f23209ddcff348", "s2:a443189d9455e62404dea951e7042f0d2c91892e", "s2:1125f04d80d6474f156b7bdbc20d53c538075f83", "s2:f1e6cf99f7bfb0a027374c1d740e939ee8b6475e", "s2:b9dd68b6cd43f8d464a988c4932d87eb9aa707d3", "s2:16aef42d9b453dad02a7aba750825bcb6e049bc1", "s2:d979923932c1dacf1abca53596ac8f309c42d02c", "s2:9664ec9218199563c48295a41a155ccbd94fb4cb", "s2:c7229ed319e58df37668e42bfdfe24028ebc7298", "s2:a44cf961a4495f5a789dfa240e2675f7fffa615e", "s2:5e23721009cd74823f22e2089caa9526de54676a", "s2:cbf4040cb14a019ff3556fad5c455e99737f169f", "s2:e3766df2220a2c2419f478aa43b055b15a7e95c4", "s2:79df82cf1fc3aaa5f86e3bf9ed5fadef09dfe458", "s2:b1e3c678ba2c1f1b118d00262a14b73403fb59c4", "s2:9d91dead9612e1c6a8dd9ae3793fe697565c744e", "s2:deb21863dc3a36cf6630856a126807cc2b18dc67", "s2:ef1ec742c3d01cae2027e690139ec22dd32b6559", "s2:7e2bee41ca1422779c38d41c0b3165c62dad5df4", "s2:3b08af33a7646a88f393f384c24d95627dfe9bfd", "s2:1ed6a4a10589618d4f26350f1a296ee767ceff6b", "s2:74bd36ab0c28a31f5ee926a8ed44a87a3b35a725", "s2:5eb85430d08304bdd799e7b3b03658403eefd185", "s2:f368defc9bd19206b70fbf044a1df5a35a7def2b", "s2:0d740e225a81371fb2643d903392aa926a0e3c8f", "s2:558d816c57ec45a48009e629b0a5c91ecc7091ae", "s2:310f224ca542e47567e946fee6fff27db0a2b9b2", "s2:b8a54527440299cef7ebd85274b30199b7fd85c5", "s2:0ffc4484d6b7df15f618dbfcd50ed733502a77b2", "s2:0fdd66fcf6b9bc04428e337df66fd510a659eb2f", "s2:16518b969b102922b113a9c36bc75bf099225838", "s2:f6238bb11533cdaa9219af368eab15d4474728d0", "s2:4411b31559393d1f63b9a65a1188aa2702e032b0", "s2:59c60fc1106235ca102473fa1fd0db46e618c6a4"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Understanding speech in “noise” or free energy minimization in the soundscapes of the anthropocene", "abstract": "Listening to speech in the presence of irrelevant sounds is ubiquitous in the modern world, but is generally acknowledged to be both effortful and unpleasant. Here we argue that this problem arises largely in circumstances that our human auditory system has not evolved to accommodate. The soundscapes of the Anthropocene are frequently characterized by an overabundance of sound sources, the vast majority of which are functionally irrelevant to a given listener. The problem of listening to speech in such environments must be solved by an auditory system that is not optimized for this task. Building on our previous work linking attention to effortful listening and incorporating an active inference approach, we argue that the answers to these questions have implications not just for the study of human audition. They are also significant for the development and broad awareness of hearing aids and cochlear implants, as well as other auditory technologies such as earbuds, immersive auditory environments, and systems for human-machine interaction.", "authors": [{"name": "Daniel J.

{"title": "Surprise! Using Physiological Stress for Allostatic Regulation Under the Active Inference Framework", "abstract": "Allostasis proposes that long-term viability of a living system is achieved through anticipatory adjustments of its physiology and behaviour: emphasising physiological and affective stress as an adaptive state that minimises long-term prediction errors. More recently, the active inference framework (AIF) has also sought to explain action and long-term adaptation through the minimisation of future errors (free energy), through the learning of statistical contingencies of the world, offering a formalism for allostatic regulation. We suggest that framing prediction errors through the lens of biological hormonal dynamics proposed by allostasis offers a way to integrate these two models together in a biologically-plausible manner. In this paper, we describe our initial work in developing a model that grounds prediction errors (surprisal) into the secretion of a physiological stress hormone (cortisol) acting as an adaptive mediator on a homeostatically-controlled physiology. We evaluate this using a computational model in simulations using an active inference agent endowed with an artificial physiology, regulated through homeostatic and allostatic control in a stochastic environment. Our results find that allostatic functions of cortisol (stress), secreted as a function of prediction errors, provide adaptive advantages to the agent's long-term physiological regulation. We argue that the coupling of information-theoretic prediction errors to low-level, biological hormonal dynamics of stress can provide a computationally efficient model to long-term regulation for embodied intelligent systems.", "authors": [{"name": "Imran Khan", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Robert Lowe", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2024, "doi": "10.1109/ACII63134.2024.00024", "arxiv_id": "2406.08471", "s2_id": "3841de4ac2ff01605d9ff4f92571d3e191ded425", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction", "citation_count": 2, "references": ["s2:bb0ea0d6088b59f558ff306858a98a39b89ddc6c", "s2:54faa01dc3dd82d4c6ff0c38c8c44f91c35dfe14", "s2:9a51a3db9011ae7827a5abf49c117f57afa2cffe", "s2:f12b2968c56b417bbdfb3bed0c13cf4c662c83b0", "s2:d2d107630f062018ddc806798811cdb0e293ec78", "s2:6567e6f5ae1a1caaef96a5b231eee7042fab2b8d", "s2:16aef42d9b453dad02a7aba750825bcb6e049bc1", "s2:2cfea1c20818efd9af66575dd2957c6487649c67", "s2:13fc63ff6dcd58893dd2383d29e4b9c4d0fb2ebf", "s2:cacb61090466116c429fd2e228a9f22f42e99aaf", "s2:3250aeda1ae672c811884331704f2fc35a3163c6", "s2:4bca8c503f010d34d34da8b36623874e5387bd03", "s2:57070167d647bfa23bc5c5895623af13576db66b", "s2:4448c8a806a46ee6b0a38a6ea8c9dc8a8362a39e", "s2:c469f8a7f02015bc49e93df26c396228267a7e7b", "s2:dde5ef8548049ab377688acbf0ee876849065e86", "s2:197c4b51d91e523820b48250d59996f6914763a2", "s2:0172c831f7c90cb0a5d586a7fa0a00da60da09b0", "s2:08291bb09f696ef20e69633918870c602c2f4f34", "s2:641a9d87b9636d4ef2e353a569ddede68bd29131", "s2:90fe0e6e6580253457e8d52a474e48e393ced87e", "s2:d333d23a0c178cce0132a7f2cc28b809115e3446", "s2:975d960faabfe8a9aefcfb0eb929d0688a6136c0", "s2:797ceb2436001c786e3f12393721897721f67474", "s2:0366fb9db0e086800f0c8189499275a39a8f0b02", "s2:8f71922f8d003ac1834db6b0b0827ade4b0c30ca", "s2:aee72c670cb09d484397350042613606dac91306", "s2:e1424a0e177f225d2ed7531613e22f72457efb0d", "s2:0fdd66fcf6b9bc04428e337df66fd510a659eb2f", "s2:a424ec3b8846f57b8ffdb566d272e28d5a525909", "s2:6ab4224276fb7df31755655f6da11330f42d77b4"], "publication_date": null}

This agent is constructed from multiple scalar autoregressive model-based agents, coupled together by virtue of sharing memories. Each subagent infers parameters through Bayesian filtering and controls by minimizing expected free energy over a finite time horizon. We demonstrate that a coupled agent of this kind is able to learn the dynamics of a double mass-spring-damper system, and drive it to a desired position through a balance of explorative and exploitative actions.

{"title": "Value of Information and Reward Specification in Active Inference and POMDPs", "abstract": "Expected free energy (EFE) is a central quantity in active inference which has recently gained popularity due to its intuitive decomposition of the expected value of control into a pragmatic and an epistemic component. While numerous conjectures have been made to justify EFE as a decision making objective function, the most widely accepted is still its intuitiveness and resemblance to variational free energy in approximate Bayesian inference. In this work, we take a bottom up approach and ask: taking EFE as given, what's the resulting agent's optimality gap compared with a reward-driven reinforcement learning (RL) agent, which is well understood? By casting EFE under a particular class of belief MDP and using analysis tools from RL theory, we show that EFE approximates the Bayes optimal RL policy via information value. We discuss the implications for objective specification of active inference agents.", "authors": [{"name": "Ran Wei", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2024, "doi": "10.48550/arXiv.2408.06542", "arxiv_id": "2408.06542", "s2_id": "27d0160a6d22d805ad9ad2f88af8fa7e49779966", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "arXiv.org", "citation_count": 3, "references": ["s2:88853bbd0878637c1bf02a9f1e4ce3acc151bed1", "s2:c6dbed0ad43956f87f41a03b0c7d784e649cb086", "s2:6191d2329cfda81dbac39aff44277dc1b0a8b3e8", "s2:615e827e9bfea05caa31b656f62af39b3c6e9a9d", "s2:abbef3f050f2381c88fbd4dd8a7818d9ba989b38", "s2:dc744d27a13da837f332b542434a4bc877b0fd17", "s2:dc65508248e7e43ff2d2287ca27a93080b87a24a", "s2:d1dd0fcba88c8ad44c015b66a21fabf927e30442", "s2:51cb188e53f8a8bc51cd7a671391d3ad5adfb8e2", "s2:874349d487c3ebe51fb139c0e22bfa56a4b1f9eb", "s2:a1282f8334e781ed33d7479fcde32956d7e9c0dc", "s2:c3ce50ad15092d9a04a417fb3ff8ed2b9b710676", "s2:5f4f196fc6277185d85816501bb814dfaeed69e4", "s2:e54427100b2de8187fe3b96303653b6220aaad44", "s2:8be55833180ec2d2fa3a0ad8f632a4e7aa2aa8d0", "s2:47fbc3ba2eeed3b5f02587b90708f912235067d3", "s2:da45e961f285fdba9aefb3f4d4270620044eccb3", "s2:3bbd90858bd3a4391e27c7cf8c218ee34e0a29a2", "s2:6be61525ee8b21c3bef6564df17b435fc4f84282", "s2:42b1bb567e233fa2c0ee3c26e21bf87e24430ec5", "s2:d0984a8c32d25b5c4de1acf697b71613e5a1d6b8", "s2:5f14c55724f4b12e91ad2e182deee876ae2b9411", "s2:2d04c6e50e6334593131ec23c9ffcae1ae706229", "s2:acae2ae3c7922927719d047ea5bc541a1a73d03e", "s2:a934a3a7f171d494556a80d31f7bf4b637376c71", "s2:a951a731ef3ab06f3961a6ffabf49249fae32cae", "s2:361e953f792a585496834ee14216b94d0ce9ae74", "s2:def8207fb6457f3c2656bac9f2bbf954de1d7de1", "s2:cfec54f9208dcbb2c558aa7ff45f57be2533d046", "s2:ec38c924a5d188e9d1e38f608e910a9691859ece", "s2:6b73775f40467aed52784ff355b9bb7168e9078c", "s2:5ea2cdab68c69d7aef5a004495783ae7628193f2", "s2:954b01151ff13aef416d27adc60cd9a076753b1a", "s2:6f24d7a6e1c88828e18d16c6db20f5329f6a6827", "s2:57620e357ee348cd5ffa8eafa480e002a2aba06a", "s2:f770614e497f456cfbe310bf7fd5223a4c28edd7", "s2:9834f41482ca5b87931d41af3923d3c13fa8e298", "s2:10666aa9c0b69350ffa412df6ada6d76dda376e6", "s2:79ab3c49903ec8cb339437ccf5cf998607fc313e", "s2:856312d3c595f5b8c01abd38bab40ee7f37c6b48", "s2:1ed6a4a10589618d4f26350f1a296ee767ceff6b", "s2:742432ccfa877d29ec30b19f0b7a3f5d4422681c", "s2:dc649486b881e672eea6546da48c46e1f98daf32", "s2:523b4ce1c2a1336962444abc1dec215756c2f3e6", "s2:36679c13bb3ab945746b75e0abb37767eacf5394", "s2:116d7798c1123cf7fad4176e98f58fd49de4f8f1", "s2:a666a97335c9ec87cce86b359bd28e85fecae580", "s2:ab2af1f206580d49f4eed40e4b61ebf88d93d705", "s2:b9dd05b69d6906fff6ea6c4ba3609a6d97c9b8a3", "s2:2046412fecff64e095cc5190b69172055afd2094", "s2:9e5e4952c07f0be23343501f74f2f3ba964005ab", "s2:b3266b25cb2ff34634aff48434652bacb3fede9c", "s2:a7b3c2a88ca459d50010a33db8c2f113f1323e0c", "s2:ff5ff13ba3155cb24d8ff88607b816f8174c6bad", "s2:63539280f9edbb56dd3acd63ed5fd85a61fb1861", "s2:2c64a065e0849f8ae5d66475ff29385f035aaf2c", "s2:0fdd66fcf6b9bc04428e337df66fd510a659eb2f", "s2:6932937c3ac9e6e42c78f0e214445d017486542f", "s2:97efafdb4a3942ab3efba53ded7413199f79c054"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "The Neural Correlates of Novelty and Variability in Human Decision-Making under an Active Inference Framework", "abstract": "Active inference integrates perception, decision-making, and learning into a united theoretical frame-work, providing an efficient way to trade off exploration and exploitation by minimizing (expected) free energy. In this study, we asked how the brain represents values and uncertainties (novelty and variability), and resolves these uncertainties under the active inference framework in the exploration-exploitation trade-off. 25 participants performed a contextual two-armed bandit task, with electroen-cephalogram (EEG) recordings. By comparing the model evidence for active inference and rein-forcement learning models of choice behavior, we show that active inference better explains human decision-making under novelty and variability, which entails exploration or information seeking. The EEG sensor-level results show that the activity in the frontal, central, and parietal regions is associated with novelty, while activity in the frontal and central brain regions is associated with variability. The EEG source-level results indicate that the expected free energy is encoded in the frontal pole and middle frontal gyrus and uncertainties are encoded in different brain regions but with overlap. Our study dissociates the expected free energy and uncertainties in active inference theory and their neural correlates, speaking to the construct validity of active inference in characterizing cognitive processes of human decisions.

{"title": "Integration of Sense and Control for Uncertain Systems Based on Delayed Feedback Active Inference", "abstract": "Asa result of the time lag in transmission, the data obtained by the sensor is delayed and does not reflect the state at the current moment. The effects of input delay are often overlooked in active inference (AIF), which may lead to significant deviations in state estimation and increased prediction errors, particularly when the system is subjected to a sudden external stimulus. In this paper, a theoretical framework of delayed feedback active inference (DAIF) is proposed to enhance the applicability of AIF to real systems. The probability model of DAIF is defined by incorporating a control distribution into that of AIF. The free energy of DAIF is defined as the sum of the quadratic state, sense, and control prediction error. A predicted state derived from previous states is defined and introduced as the expectation of the prior distribution of the real-time state. A proportional-integral (PI)-like control based on the predicted state is taken to be the expectation of DAIF preference control, whose gain coefficient is inversely proportional to the measurement accuracy variance. To adaptively compensate for external disturbances, a second-order inverse variance accuracy replaces the fixed sensory accuracy of preference control. The simulation results of the trajectory tracking control of a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) show that DAIF performs better than AIF in state estimation and disturbance resistance.", "authors": [{"name": "Mingyue Ji", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Kunpeng Pan", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Xiaoxuan Zhang", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Quan Pan", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Xiangcheng Dai", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Yang Lyu", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2024, "doi": "10.3390/e26110990", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": "7786a4bf7705618550f80c453ce995a367ffc92f", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "Entropy", "citation_count": 1, "references": ["s2:dded71d2681fb42c1d149286b636b066ab6a0910", "s2:6a3ca7a5153cea9271e761a2ea2cc566b79e6788", "s2:12a494043e159e0c6b47b8c72c16b3e3523e9272", "s2:d825092cebfba0321e821d669e837fc03d5fb1f9", "s2:322bfd87bc36c7f2ae13a725bb06c3fb789ef857", "s2:9479ced8f325fdd53b8fc2ea5ca0a1d0be9c4ed1", "s2:ddd19b377970ee3572610440509c0b09124870e0", "s2:d5879cf10556df7e6fc77669f6b2ff8c973b3575", "s2:4d6d5233f5e866d23b32494c140e08ea49896e11", "s2:2197f3c2270f267e5e37d0e3e51979d1304cf9dd", "s2:3d04e7f5ff1bd01c975ba277ad9585911fb7bce9", "s2:57c444c070bc709d176432913d2b30a9627cac25", "s2:864b44d3b4a8eba5e854f514e7e4a9c2eabe7194", "s2:5bfe60370082a615a5430d0ed7fdfda626e84384", "s2:4790ad7643318714e1596f2ad44de995a8b678ae", "s2:7a79e00724e7e071599a5d46d401188d524106d3", "s2:4aebc0c6dc90f27579b9a781588b13dead81de53", "s2:99dcf8238f78e8c056ab785f694efb5c204383a0", "s2:754b657330b1674d3453e8254d3a664db5222b3b", "s2:689b6ef37b29618a0a6417528b193173220c382d", "s2:953a04672568bf53a11cf7fb26a04253a897e499", "s2:ee235788090db25f041d27d921317944c9d730b4", "s2:90878acb0048b0f0ff135f9dec734819990e4180", "s2:42998f6a0ef243ffb5555ced81319ea5e8bba788", "s2:407bb3034daac0fb4fba3d4c09ef3a26dfbfcf5f", "s2:8848ec495120fee9d3a0bc5131897b4f7a679408", "s2:1ed6a4a10589618d4f26350f1a296ee767ceff6b", "s2:c09fb7cfa28cde7ab254f878a5987758b8c5f4d0", "s2:7fdec5a9d98696d5533d773c7ce9018e7fddaabd", "s2:bbde538c1a1bbdfa4096114a1cae378e9e506872", "s2:d4323cf65589bc509aea260ccaa4ef32a94b2f7e", "s2:6120cc252bc74239012f11b8b075cb7cb16bee26", "s2:bcb15495b263eb3fa4cb34748a67ad571eee382f", "s2:c8efbecae1b89ef3965baa73d7cd4009ffe0c40e", "s2:f1080801e567fda66c016d861a1f7a3e9aaed63a", "s2:e6ec232c3093227e18c273703b8233592d86a96c", "s2:0fdd66fcf6b9bc04428e337df66fd510a659eb2f", "s2:4f8d648c52edf74e41b0996128aa536e13cc7e82", "s2:ce3b238dc79e77b054cc98fdaadf54dbfba3926e", "s2:02810c0a71afbeb54e9afa9a42d6f620b9871c9a", "s2:2e367a13cfc215949568c8a2c8c5a6a5bcf55441"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Learning and embodied decisions in active inference", "abstract": "Biological organisms constantly face the necessity to act timely in dynamic environments and balance choice accuracy against the risk of missing valid opportunities. As formalized by embodied decision models, this might require brain architectures wherein decision-making and motor control interact reciprocally, in stark contrast to traditional models that view them as serial processes. Previous studies have assessed that embodied decision dynamics emerge naturally under active inference – a computational paradigm that considers action and perception as subject to the same imperative of free energy minimization. In particular, agents can infer their targets by using their own movements (and not only external sensations) as evidence, i.e., via self-evidencing. Such models have shown that under appropriate conditions, action-generated feedback can stabilize and improve decision processes. However, how adaptation of internal models to environmental contingencies influences embodied decisions is yet to be addressed. To shed light on this challenge, in this study we systematically investigate the learning dynamics of an embodied model of decision-making during a two-alternative forced choice task, using a hybrid (discrete and continuous) active inference framework. Our results show that active inference agents can adapt to embodied contexts by learning various statistical regularities of the task – namely, prior preferences for the correct target, cue validity, and response strategies that prioritize faster or slower (but more accurate) decisions. Crucially, these results illustrate the efficacy of learning discrete preferences and strategies using sensorimotor feedback from continuous dynamics.", "authors": [{"name": "Matteo Priorelli", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Ivilin Peev Stoianov", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Giovanni Pezzulo", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2024, "doi": "10.1101/2024.08.18.608439", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": "883d2bb61d044925723bc45401679602388b75d6", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "bioRxiv", "citation_count": 1, "references": ["s2:f45b61a7322acffbfae77a76f19eb54791f157a9", "s2:ff1b9a61fbd51c96cf45318b793aa71f91a99a3b", "s2:e36509babfc4cf04c4a309bbd9f24729e3d8ea80", "s2:509bc981074ae955f0ae737b6bcd1a5365ce1fac", "s2:1e206726e13b854302796590de239327172eb3b4", "s2:c3829409915c802108c329a22598bee2924cecee", "s2:b969967e402c5b1a8ba39cc68882d3fe0cbee6fc", "s2:a335cf4bf4b8a07c5547807adbaa6a081d4aa9b7", "s2:3425f6f3d524fcdbe0172f901ee6cc51df6b10c3", "s2:113ed2dbb5df54532c28c58977e6f4ab815531f1", "s2:ff099ae352c650f17b1cd19469f68aee97e1355b", "s2:16aef42d9b453dad02a7aba750825bcb6e049bc1", "s2:932c42e1e824734d67e2cb5633fabebe01d89054", "s2:ac75529b63c686d7989f523c2b4b487b1f3660e0", "s2:a934a3a7f171d494556a80d31f7bf4b637376c71", "s2:af18f9af89187755e120cc5402efc62e55f218b7", "s2:aaf4ad6cfeef9d6838e2d75dc44bc1ed88c95f6c", "s2:a15bb35896648c84a6e94cc7b264da835771ecd6", "s2:ba32956360922261e0fb6545df70a9cce6b22a6f", "s2:09c05f75e88dcbf417eb57c5c3771305c44b4918", "s2:654b36000eccf157a9e1f3080b921763a218282a", "s2:2a42d205c706324a1641cebe60b6389ac90b5dbf", "s2:d74bc360096ed0f2b65d64b14046bc51bbd58115", "s2:35fbfd8f16548e444556a9e0f8000d422fb3a714", "s2:7125d6ee7d9b0d76e2f7834ecc82c8e9e8ec7298", "s2:76f5f07ad02772baf50138b2153dbbbab030bd60", "s2:03cbad7e7d88c3d4aafbe96af8ae3dade3772963", "s2:1c2226d9eba78ddf37ec68f4d6763317b42ac20d", "s2:1e98951ed8132415c6a5329ce083dd56c5d3d543", "s2:91c96718e77d5ce575dda517d7c74985df3943a1", "s2:026c135433809abd331b2ff69e35bb6c6dc6bbff", "s2:59cf698630a4aa25e5772a199a5d4745eae48156", "s2:1dccc2d2207d25b4d7bde33d74f33b9ec97f0eaf", "s2:1c53f6fdcef2afa88afe77332a9aa0ba2eb347a8", "s2:b60e3ab7c0c89a8639d5555cc4e69fd9cba729d2", "s2:2a4e9d7d9be677b3f2da8316cb1c2368ce260654", "s2:4f1046f538fac7b9181b1c27a66223d7d031da7b", "s2:3cbead20fdeb3d85835be14b225965039722c83b", "s2:2575f6dfdda31baddff89640174649153b67c5dc", "s2:da3e4a8ad14b66c60e838def7ad4ed656190969b"], "publication_date": null}

{"title": "Demonstrating the Continual Learning Capabilities and Practical Application of Discrete-Time Active Inference", "abstract": "Active inference is a mathematical framework for understanding how agents (biological or artificial) interact with their environments, enabling continual adaptation and decision-making. It combines Bayesian inference and free energy minimization to model perception, action, and learning in uncertain and dynamic contexts. Unlike reinforcement learning, active inference integrates exploration and exploitation seamlessly by minimizing expected free energy. In this paper, we present a continual learning framework for agents operating in discrete time environments, using active inference as the foundation. We derive the mathematical formulations of variational and expected free energy and apply them to the design of a self-learning research agent.

{"title": "Deconstructing Deep Active Inference: A Contrarian Information Gatherer", "abstract": "Abstract Active inference is a theory of perception, learning, and decision making that can be applied to neuroscience, robotics, psychology, and machine learning. Recently, intensive research has been taking place to scale up this framework using Monte Carlo tree search and deep learning. The goal of this activity is to solve more complicated tasks using deep active inference. First, we review the existing literature and then progressively build a deep active inference agent as follows: we (1) implement a variational autoencoder (VAE), (2) implement a deep hidden Markov model (HMM), and (3) implement a deep critical hidden Markov model (CHMM). For the CHMM, we implemented two versions, one minimizing expected free energy, CHMM[EFE] and one maximizing rewards, CHMM[reward]. Then we experimented with three different action selection strategies: the ε-greedy algorithm as well as softmax and best action selection. According to our experiments, the models able to solve the dSprites environment are the ones that maximize rewards. On further inspection, we found that the CHMM minimizing expected free energy almost always picks the same action, which makes it unable to solve the dSprites environment. In contrast, the CHMM maximizing reward keeps on selecting all the actions, enabling it to successfully solve the task. The only difference between those two CHMMs is the epistemic value, which aims to make the outputs of the transition and encoder networks as close as possible. Thus, the CHMM minimizing expected free energy repeatedly picks a single action and becomes an expert at predicting the future when selecting this action. This effectively makes the KL divergence between the output of the transition and encoder networks small. Additionally, when selecting the action down the average reward is zero, while for all the other actions, the expected reward will be negative. Therefore, if the CHMM has to stick to a single action to keep the KL divergence small, then the action down is the most rewarding. We also show in simulation that the epistemic value used in deep active inference can behave degenerately and in certain circumstances effectively lose, rather than gain, information. As the agent minimizing EFE is not able to explore its environment, the appropriate formulation of the epistemic value in deep active inference remains an open question.", "authors": [{"name": "Théophile Champion", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Marek Grzes", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Lisa Bonheme", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Howard Bowman", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2024, "doi": "10.1162/neco_a_01697", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": "1431518016b9bac91801470336ceace51079a8c2", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "Neural Computation", "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "A Diffusion Model-Based Approach to Active Inference", "abstract": "One of the current challenges in machine learning is the acquisition of generative models to enable decision making in complex, uncertain environments. In Bayesian methods like Active Inference, this requires the estimation of posterior distributions, which is often intractable. Variational Free Energy (VFE) provides a tractable approximation method for this estimation. This paper proposes a novel framework that leverages the expressive power of diffusion models to estimate free energy quickly and efficiently. Our approach, merging concepts from statistical physics, machine learning, and computational neuroscience, aims to improve the estimation of posterior distributions. We establish a theoretical link between active inference and diffusion models, emphasizing their shared strategies for uncertainty management, action selection, and model optimization. We propose using diffusion processes to approximate environmental generative models and employ score-based guidance for action selection through expected free-energy minimization. Simulations in increasingly complex grid world environments demonstrate the framework's ability to handle partial observability and stochastic transitions, showing enhanced goal-directed behavior and uncertainty resolution compared to traditional methods. This suggests a path toward scalable active inference agents that could reason about uncertainty in real-world contexts, with possible applications to robotics, healthcare, and adaptive control systems.", "authors": [{"name": "Elias Aoun Durand", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Mateus Joffily", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Mehdi Khamassi", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2024, "doi": "10.1109/FMLDS63805.2024.00024", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": "43e3fab98490cf870f63440e70cf302e0ffd1f5d", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "2024 IEEE International Conference on Future Machine Learning and Data Science (FMLDS)", "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": null}

{"title": "Reframing the Expected Free Energy: Four Formulations and a Unification", "abstract": "Active inference is a leading theory of perception, learning and decision making, which can be applied to neuroscience, robotics, psychology, and machine learning. Active inference is based on the expected free energy, which is mostly justified by the intuitive plausibility of its formulations, e.g., the risk plus ambiguity and information gain / pragmatic value formulations. This paper seek to formalize the problem of deriving these formulations from a single root expected free energy definition, i.e., the unification problem. Then, we study two settings, each one having its own root expected free energy definition. In the first setting, no justification for the expected free energy has been proposed to date, but all the formulations can be recovered from it. However, in this setting, the agent cannot have arbitrary prior preferences over observations. Indeed, only a limited class of prior preferences over observations is compatible with the likelihood mapping of the generative model. In the second setting, a justification of the root expected free energy definition is known, but this setting only accounts for two formulations, i.e., the risk over states plus ambiguity and entropy plus expected energy formulations.", "authors": [{"name": "Théophile Champion", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Howard Bowman", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Dimitrije Markovi'c", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Marek Grze's", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2024, "doi": "10.48550/arXiv.2402.14460", "arxiv_id": "2402.14460", "s2_id": "88853bbd0878637c1bf02a9f1e4ce3acc151bed1", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "arXiv.org", "citation_count": 6, "references": [], "publication_date": null}

{"title": "Free Energy in a Circumplex Model of Emotion", "abstract": "Previous active inference accounts of emotion translate fluctuations in free energy to a sense of emotion, mainly focusing on valence. However, in affective science, emotions are often represented as multi-dimensional. In this paper, we propose to adopt a Circumplex Model of emotion by mapping emotions into a two-dimensional spectrum of valence and arousal. We show how one can derive a valence and arousal signal from an agent's expected free energy, relating arousal to the entropy of posterior beliefs and valence to utility less expected utility. Under this formulation, we simulate artificial agents engaged in a search task.

{"title": "Active Inference Modeling of Socially Shared Cognition in Virtual Reality", "abstract": "This study proposes a process model for sharing ambiguous category concepts in virtual reality (VR) using an active inference framework. The model executes a dual-layer Bayesian update after observing both self and partner actions and predicts actions that minimize free energy. To incorporate agreement-seeking with others into active inference, we added disagreement in category judgments as a risk term in the free energy, weighted by gaze synchrony measured using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), which is assumed to reflect joint attention. To validate the model, an object classification task in VR including ambiguous items was created. The experiment was conducted first under a bot avatar condition, in which ambiguous category judgments were always incorrect, and then under a human–human pair condition. This design allowed verification of the collaborative learning process by which human pairs reached agreement from the same degree of ambiguity. Analysis of experimental data from 14 participants showed that the model achieved high prediction accuracy for observed values as learning progressed. Introducing gaze synchrony weighting (γ0≥0.5) further improved prediction accuracy, yielding optimal performance.

It delves into how living organisms employ generative models to minimize the discrepancy between predictions and observations (as scored with variational free energy).

Different living organisms may possess an array of generative models, spanning from those that support action‐perception cycles to those that underwrite planning and imagination; namely, from explicit models that entail variables for predicting concurrent sensations, like objects, faces, or people—to action‐oriented models that predict action outcomes. It then elucidates how generative models and belief dynamics might link to neural representation and the implications of different types of generative models for understanding an agent's cognitive capabilities in relation to its ecological niche.

{"title": "Deconstructing deep active inference", "abstract": "Active inference is a theory of perception, learning and decision making, which can be applied to neuroscience, robotics, and machine learning. Recently, reasearch has been taking place to scale up this framework using Monte-Carlo tree search and deep learning. The goal of this activity is to solve more complicated tasks using deep active inference. First, we review the existing literature, then, we progresively build a deep active inference agent. For two agents, we have experimented with five definitions of the expected free energy and three different action selection strategies. According to our experiments, the models able to solve the dSprites environment are the ones that maximise rewards. Finally, we compare the similarity of the representation learned by the layers of various agents using centered kernel alignment. Importantly, the agent maximising reward and the agent minimising expected free energy learn very similar representations except for the last layer of the critic network (reflecting the difference in learning objective), and the variance layers of the transition and encoder networks. We found that the reward maximising agent is a lot more certain than the agent minimising expected free energy. This is because the agent minimising expected free energy always picks the action down, and does not gather enough data for the other actions. In contrast, the agent maximising reward, keeps on selecting the actions left and right, enabling it to successfully solve the task. The only difference between those two agents is the epistemic value, which aims to make the outputs of the transition and encoder networks as close as possible. Thus, the agent minimising expected free energy picks a single action (down), and becomes an expert at predicting the future when selecting this action. This makes the KL divergence between the output of the transition and encoder networks small.", "authors": [{"name": "Théophile Champion", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Marek Grze's", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Lisa Bonheme", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "H.

{"title": "Reframing the Expected Free Energy: Four Formulations and a Unification.", "abstract": "Active inference is a process theory of perception, learning, and decision making that is applied to a range of research fields, including neuroscience, robotics, psychology, and machine learning. Active inference rests on an objective function called the expected free energy, which can be justified by the intuitive plausibility of its formulations-for example, the risk plus ambiguity and information gain/pragmatic value formulations. This letter seeks to formalize the problem of deriving these formulations from a single root expected free energy definition-the unification problem. Then we analyze two approaches to defining expected free energy. More precisely, the expected free energy is either defined as (1) the risk over observations plus ambiguity or (2) the risk over states plus ambiguity. In the first setting, no rigorous mathematical justification for the expected free energy has been proposed to date, but all the formulations can be recovered from it by assuming that the likelihood of target distribution T(o|s) is the likelihood of the generative model P(o|s). Importantly, under this likelihood constraint, if the likelihood is lossless,1 then prior preferences over observations can be defined arbitrarily. However, in the more general case of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs), we demonstrate that the likelihood constraint effectively restricts the set of valid prior preferences over observations. Indeed, only a limited class of prior preferences over observations is compatible with the likelihood mapping of the generative model. In the second setting, a justification of the root expected free energy definition exists, but this setting only accounts for two formulations: the risk over states plus ambiguity and entropy plus expected energy formulations. We conclude with a discussion of the conditions under which a unification of expected free energy formulations has been proposed in the literature by appeal to the free energy principle in the specific context of systems without random fluctuations.", "authors": [{"name": "Théophile Champion", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Howard Bowman", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Dimitrije Marković", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Marek Grzes", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2026, "doi": "10.1162/NECO.a.1491", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": "09e2c4b3e8178d18c391fcde6b6db2d8dfc82514", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "Neural Computation", "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Score matching the descriptor density of states for model-agnostic free energy estimation", "abstract": "Vibrational free energy estimation is a cornerstone of atomic simulation, essential to predict finite-temperature material properties. Expressing the free energy as a function of interatomic potential parameters is actively sought in modern workflows for uncertainty quantification or inverse design. However, to achieve meV/atom accuracy, existing schemes conduct slow, sequential sampling with fixed potential parameters. We present a solution, an efficient model-agnostic free energy estimator which is meV/atom accurate over a broad, multi-element parameter range. For a broad class of machine learning potentials we show the free energy is the Legendre transform of an entropy function, accurately estimated via score-matching. Sampling requires 10× less effort than a single traditional estimate, tensor compression ensures lightweight storage, and inference is instantaneous. We demonstrate targeting of phase boundaries in back-propagation, fine-tuning the α − γ transition temperature in a Fe model from 2030 K to 1063 K. Extensions to a range of high-dimensional integration tasks are discussed.

{"title": "Stochastic surprisal: An inferential measurement of free energy in neural networks", "abstract": "This paper conjectures and validates a framework that allows for action during inference in supervised neural networks. Supervised neural networks are constructed with the objective to maximize their performance metric in any given task. This is done by reducing free energy and its associated surprisal during training. However, the bottom-up inference nature of supervised networks is a passive process that renders them fallible to noise. In this paper, we provide a thorough background of supervised neural networks, both generative and discriminative, and discuss their functionality from the perspective of free energy principle. We then provide a framework for introducing action during inference. We introduce a new measurement called stochastic surprisal that is a function of the network, the input, and any possible action. This action can be any one of the outputs that the neural network has learnt, thereby lending stochasticity to the measurement. Stochastic surprisal is validated on two applications: Image Quality Assessment and Recognition under noisy conditions. We show that, while noise characteristics are ignored to make robust recognition, they are analyzed to estimate image quality scores. We apply stochastic surprisal on two applications, three datasets, and as a plug-in on 12 networks. In all, it provides a statistically significant increase among all measures. We conclude by discussing the implications of the proposed stochastic surprisal in other areas of cognitive psychology including expectancy-mismatch and abductive reasoning.", "authors": [{"name": "M.

{"title": "Simple Method to Optimize the Spacing and Number of Alchemical Intermediates in Expanded Ensemble Free Energy Calculations", "abstract": "Alchemical free energy calculations are essential to modern structure-based drug design. Such calculations are usually performed at a series of discrete intermediates along a nonphysical thermodynamic pathway to estimate the free energy difference between two end points of an alchemical transformation. The efficiency and accuracy of the free energy estimate depends critically on the choice of alchemical intermediates. In this paper, we review the concept of thermodynamic length, and how it can be used as a principle to choose alchemical paths in free energy simulations. We then present an algorithm for optimizing the choice of alchemical intermediates in free energy simulations. Our method is similar to the thermodynamic trailblazing algorithm of Rizzi et al. (2020), but with several improvements for use with expanded ensemble (EE) simulations. Our method only requires a single initial round of EE simulation and includes a method for optimizing the number of alchemical intermediates in an EE simulation based on the predicted mixing time. We first show how the method performs in a simple toy model, and then demonstrate its use in a realistic example for an alchemical relative thermostability free energy calculation. We also show how our method can be used to optimize free energy estimates in other contexts, namely, calculating a score for model selection in the Bayesian Inference of Conformational Populations (BICePs) approach.

{"title": "Self-Evidencing Through Hierarchical Gradient Decomposition: A Dissipative System That Maintains Non-Equilibrium Steady-State by Minimizing Variational Free Energy", "abstract": "The Free Energy Principle (FEP) states that self-organizing systems must minimize variational free energy to persist, but the path from principle to implementable algorithm has remained unclear. We present a constructive proof that the FEP can be realized through exact local credit assignment. The system decomposes gradient computation hierarchically: spatial credit via feedback alignment, temporal credit via eligibility traces, and structural credit via a Trophic Field Map (TFM) that estimates expected gradient magnitude for each connection block. We prove these mechanisms are exact at their respective levels and validate the central claim empirically: the TFM achieves 0.9693 Pearson correlation with oracle gradients. This exactness produces emergent capabilities including 98.6% retention after task interference, autonomous recovery from 75% structural damage, self-organized criticality (spectral radius p ~= 1.0$), and sample-efficient reinforcement learning on continuous control tasks without replay buffers. The architecture unifies Prigogine's dissipative structures, Friston's free energy minimization, and Hopfield's attractor dynamics, demonstrating that exact hierarchical inference over network topology can be implemented with local, biologically plausible rules.", "authors": [{"name": "Michael James McCulloch", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2025, "doi": "10.48550/arXiv.2510.17916", "arxiv_id": "2510.17916", "s2_id": "66acf93f14d50ccfde8ef361e07003e2b7e15617", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "arXiv.org", "citation_count": 0, "references": ["s2:467bc29de103548648cc0907fea0b553ca8e14c7", "s2:a9d27f7568ab5e847d8e4d321183255516db092f", "s2:e54427100b2de8187fe3b96303653b6220aaad44", "s2:1eecf3b4255909953a2a8973411ea47ce8d054a6", "s2:6a8092b98771b8157437e71e351ae1231bdd8259", "s2:46924699ccba70793ad32d281692c2a5897d9bb4", "s2:a44cf961a4495f5a789dfa240e2675f7fffa615e", "s2:df2faa5cc3272dd43ddab5cef5614a8884741b81", "s2:c1f457e31b611da727f9aef76c283a18157dfa83", "s2:50bdda28de3dcf82a0e10f9ec13eea248b19edb5", "s2:d367d4de86dce92d30fba888ad190957f9ae14d8", "s2:6dbb9e4b2e3b67dc4e1634989511f67d41373dd0", "s2:754b657330b1674d3453e8254d3a664db5222b3b", "s2:a99d857ecc78316a0d9a774972b775058d5644ca", "s2:57070167d647bfa23bc5c5895623af13576db66b", "s2:2e55ba6c97ce5eb55abd959909403fe8da7e9fe9", "s2:17ebe1eb19655543a6b876f91d41917488e70f55", "s2:67d968c7450878190e45ac7886746de867bf673d", "s2:33eadd267dddaac896936025872a8c54afa112fb", "s2:e61d752b1eeba3033d9ce3e8c9382df9b4041956", "s2:ed332c92664cd64843a7ba9373d992e9547230f6", "s2:01aa6ef498431fb8c6d45e9375bb39a7a923b9bb", "s2:9179b179c45bdaa633a50c350a0fee0239a9b22c", "s2:1ff9a37d766e3a4f39757f5e1b235a42dacf18ff", "s2:57620e357ee348cd5ffa8eafa480e002a2aba06a", "s2:0f5db40de6d3a05476a3247195a2fe5a0a4da23c", "s2:deb21863dc3a36cf6630856a126807cc2b18dc67", "s2:755bfd4f8060d5fcda64eaedb81a520ab7c8bdba", "s2:d8ca79626badba6da19de8d6dcee12bfeb8df130", "s2:da9e0a4fa0e45f111c574eec831f4c3081c09de5", "s2:1ed6a4a10589618d4f26350f1a296ee767ceff6b", "s2:a878886efacc6a5d742bf98bfc25c0734ce502b1", "s2:3fae977b5bab836a30db3f245fd330b5cc3a9180", "s2:0cc859ab1a8bc52fe0a469b4b92e3375f01fb290", "s2:641a9d87b9636d4ef2e353a569ddede68bd29131", "s2:c931066213a32e5d257b30a0d371ac2d014dd3c5", "s2:2a3146db2f3cb39ef37105d428eef964a253daf2", "s2:ff96fff4b7b211e54ae049888a6cc05786e6c378", "s2:04c6461e524107198eb98835cd6ba2f7733b3163", "s2:a17c8d7670e04e7291ed66f725a1cf1c62064922", "s2:e0535dedb8607d83cd2614317c99913378e89e26", "s2:ad885d399151feaa8b4f95a9de94c62ce1f4eb02", "s2:396289eb7b2ff84c0b3281bfe1f09f4cc7f3280f", "s2:2722b9e5ab8da95f03e578bb65879c452c105385", "s2:a374a088bdc369ce7e0c3923c0f61d4b4747bbd2", "s2:605402e235bd62437baf3c9ebefe77fb4d92ee95", "s2:2ebf18e7892e660a833152ddc6cf8f1d21a7b881", "s2:0c4d193b4e8520dbc583cc7ee59c8417869f67ce", "s2:3dc3a0efe58eaf8564ca1965c0ffd23ec495b83f", "s2:18aa8a0502e717c114312a3ba63dbb76fbcab47c", "s2:1a3d22599028a05669e884f3eaf19a342e190a87", "s2:c724fcc1df5f678b0d84847259741375f0248717", "s2:052b1d8ce63b07fec3de9dbb583772d860b7c769", "s2:b0f93cf5b155e9deccec9ddd6978fb3b4775878b", "s2:bd10cbddb8407ac2eaccf9ec4cf2de2524813552", "s2:98b4d4e24aab57ab4e1124ff8106909050645cfa", "s2:b77ca73f9b176fd828256fcab0c3c326f4ae4dd2", "s2:48e95947dc5e0a8c727612b3c963dfed4e3db4c1", "s2:0e647a17f8826570688895082ed0309e9bbe26cd", "s2:5fddd5a5b4952032e4213f60595e9bf81d5532ed", "s2:8430c0b9afa478ae660398704b11dca1221ccf22", "s2:a424ec3b8846f57b8ffdb566d272e28d5a525909", "s2:8044fb7ae6c271dca38201cbe603b7921c821334", "s2:97efafdb4a3942ab3efba53ded7413199f79c054", "s2:9438172bfbb74a6a4ea4242b180d4335bb1f18b7", "s2:c213af6582c0d518a6e8e14217611c733eeb1ef1", "s2:22069cd4504656d3bb85748a4d43be7a4d7d5545", "s2:3b3903f7914483e21576f9d098e611deef95ec45"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "The glial-neural ensemble as a free energy minimizing system for affective computation", "abstract": "Recent successes of Artificial Intelligence in mimicking human emotional intelligence highlight a critical distinction between pattern recognition and genuine affective understanding. This paper argues that true affective computation requires a shift from neuron-centric, data-driven models to a unified neuro-glial framework governed by first principles of biophysics and information theory. We propose a comprehensive model grounded in the Free Energy Principle (FEP), which posits that any self-organizing system, including the brain, must act to minimize prediction error or 'surprise'. Within this framework, we derive novel mathematical models for the distinct computational roles of glial cells, which constitute over half the cells in the human brain. We formalize astrocytes as regulators of synaptic precision, dynamically tuning the confidence in sensory evidence through calcium-dependent signaling. Microglia are modeled as agents of Bayesian model selection, optimizing the network's structure by pruning synapses that fail to contribute to long-term free energy minimization. Oligodendrocytes are shown to optimize the temporal priors of the brain's generative model by adaptively tuning axonal conduction delays through myelin plasticity. These functions are integrated into a unified, multi-timescale architecture based on a dynamic, heterogeneous graph neural network. In this model, affect is not a programmed output but an emergent property of the system's ongoing inference about the causes of salient interoceptive and exteroceptive states. Affective valence is cast as the rate of change of free energy, while arousal corresponds to the system's overall uncertainty. This work provides a biophysically grounded and mathematically explicit blueprint for a new generation of AI capable of a deeper, more generative form of emotional intelligence.", "authors": [{"name": "Harold H.

{"title": "Enerdast: a Free Energy Based Mechanism for Strategy Tuning in Sparse Reward Scenarios", "abstract": "Sparse reward environments, where agents only receive positive feedback upon completing specific tasks, present a significant challenge for Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques as these often hinge upon eagerly acquiring rewards from the environment to optimize reward-centered strategies. This paper proposes a solution named Free-Energy-Driven Adaptive Strategy Tuning (EnerDAST). Drawing from biological insights, EnerDAST introduces the concept of free energy into data generation and trains the algorithm to actively infer environmental models. Subsequently, it adeptly determines decisions by meticulously assessing possible incentives and the congruence between the environmental model and real-world conditions. By integrating the principle of free energy into the training process, EnerDAST can enhance its capabilities to overcome the challenges posed by sparse reward scenarios. The experimental evidence provided within this study highlights EnerDAST's superior performance against other state-of-the-art RL algorithms, demonstrating its efficacy through rigorous testing across multiple continuous control tasks in the MuJoCo, D4RL and real-world environments.", "authors": [{"name": "Zihao Li", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Yilin Lang", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Siqi Wang", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Qinyuan Ren", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2025, "doi": "10.1109/CCDC65474.2025.11090349", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": "db7f60ab5da3c84a47f43bb13b5a2a9e96dcd90d", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "Chinese Control and Decision Conference", "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": null}

{"title": "Simulating homeostatic, allostatic and goal-directed forms of interoceptive control using active inference", "abstract": "The adaptive regulation of bodily and interoceptive parameters, such as body temperature, thirst and hunger is a central problem for any biological organism. Here, we present a series of simulations using the framework of Active Inference to formally characterize interoceptive control and some of its dysfunctions. We start from the premise that the goal of interoceptive control is to minimize a discrepancy between expected and actual interoceptive sensations (i.e., a prediction error or free energy). Importantly, living organisms can achieve this goal by using various forms of interoceptive control: homeostatic, allostatic and goal-directed. We provide a computationally-guided analysis of these different forms of interoceptive control, by showing that they correspond to distinct generative models within Active Inference. Furthermore, we illustrate how these generative models may support empirical research, by predicting physiological and brain signals that may accompany both adaptive and maladaptive interoceptive control.

{"title": "Active Inference Integrated with Imitation Learning for Autonomous Driving", "abstract": "Classical imitation learning methods suffer substantially from the learning hierarchical policies when the imitative agent faces an unobserved state by the expert agent. To address these drawbacks, we propose an online active learning through active inference approach that encodes the expert’s demonstrations based on observation-action to improve the learner’s future motion prediction. For this purpose, we provide a switching Dynamic Bayesian Network based on the dynamic interaction between the expert agent and another object in its surrounding as a reference model, which we exploit to initialize an incremental probabilistic learning model. This learning model grows and matures based on the free-energy formulation and message passing of active inference dynamically at discrete and continuous levels in an online active learning phase. In this scheme, generalized states of the learning world are represented as distance-vector, where it is the learner’s observation concerning its interaction with a moving object. Considering the distance vector entail intentions, it enables action prediction evaluation in a prospective sense. We illustrate these points using simulations of driving intelligent agents. The learning agent is trained by using long-term predictions from the generative learning model to reproduce the expert’s motion while learning how to select a suitable action through new experiences. Our results affirm that a Dynamic Bayesian optimal approach provides a principled framework and outperforms conventional reinforcement learning methods. Furthermore, it endorses the general formulation of action prediction as active inference.", "authors": [{"name": "Sheida Nozari", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Ali Krayani", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Pablo Marín-Plaza", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "L.

{"title": "Disentangling Shape and Pose for Object-Centric Deep Active Inference Models", "abstract": "Active inference is a first principles approach for understanding the brain in particular, and sentient agents in general, with the single imperative of minimizing free energy. As such, it provides a computational account for modelling artificial intelligent agents, by defining the agent's generative model and inferring the model parameters, actions and hidden state beliefs. However, the exact specification of the generative model and the hidden state space structure is left to the experimenter, whose design choices influence the resulting behaviour of the agent. Recently, deep learning methods have been proposed to learn a hidden state space structure purely from data, alleviating the experimenter from this tedious design task, but resulting in an entangled, non-interpreteable state space. In this paper, we hypothesize that such a learnt, entangled state space does not necessarily yield the best model in terms of free energy, and that enforcing different factors in the state space can yield a lower model complexity. In particular, we consider the problem of 3D object representation, and focus on different instances of the ShapeNet dataset. We propose a model that factorizes object shape, pose and category, while still learning a representation for each factor using a deep neural network. We show that models, with best disentanglement properties, perform best when adopted by an active agent in reaching preferred observations.", "authors": [{"name": "Stefano Ferraro", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Toon Van de Maele", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Pietro Mazzaglia", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Tim Verbelen", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "B.

This variational principle also yields a decomposition of fluxes, forces, and dissipation (entropy production) into a conservative\"excess\"part and a nonconservative\"housekeeping\"part. Our decomposition is universally applicable to stochastic master equations, deterministic chemical reaction networks, and open systems. We also show that the excess entropy production obeys a thermodynamic speed limit (TSL), a fundamental thermodynamic constraint on the rate of state evolution and/or external fluxes. We demonstrate our approach on several examples, including real-world metabolic networks, where we derive fundamental dissipation bounds and uncover\"futile\"metabolic cycles.

{"title": "Intersubjectivity as an antidote to stress: Using dyadic active inference model of intersubjectivity to predict the efficacy of parenting interventions in reducing stress—through the lens of dependent origination in Buddhist Madhyamaka philosophy", "abstract": "Intersubjectivity refers to one person’s awareness in relation to another person’s awareness. It is key to well-being and human development. From infancy to adulthood, human interactions ceaselessly contribute to the flourishing or impairment of intersubjectivity. In this work, we first describe intersubjectivity as a hallmark of quality dyadic processes. Then, using parent-child relationship as an example, we propose a dyadic active inference model to elucidate an inverse relation between stress and intersubjectivity. We postulate that impaired intersubjectivity is a manifestation of underlying problems of deficient relational benevolence, misattributing another person’s intentions (over-mentalizing), and neglecting the effects of one’s own actions on the other person (under-coupling). These problems can exacerbate stress due to excessive variational free energy in a person’s active inference engine when that person feels threatened and holds on to his/her invalid (mis)beliefs. In support of this dyadic model, we briefly describe relevant neuroimaging literature to elucidate brain networks underlying the effects of an intersubjectivity-oriented parenting intervention on parenting stress. Using the active inference dyadic model, we identified critical interventional strategies necessary to rectify these problems and hereby developed a coding system in reference to these strategies. In a theory-guided quantitative review, we used this coding system to code 35 clinical trials of parenting interventions published between 2016 and 2020, based on PubMed database, to predict their efficacy for reducing parenting stress. The results of this theory-guided analysis corroborated our hypothesis that parenting intervention can effectively reduce parenting stress if the intervention is designed to mitigate the problems of deficient relational benevolence, under-coupling, and over-mentalizing. We integrated our work with several dyadic concepts identified in the literature.

{"title": "Learning Generative Models for Active Inference using Tensor Networks", "abstract": "Active inference provides a general framework for behavior and learning in autonomous agents. It states that an agent will attempt to minimize its variational free energy, defined in terms of beliefs over observations, internal states and policies. Traditionally, every aspect of a discrete active inference model must be specified by hand, i.e. by manually defining the hidden state space structure, as well as the required distributions such as likelihood and transition probabilities. Recently, efforts have been made to learn state space representations automatically from observations using deep neural networks. In this paper, we present a novel approach of learning state spaces using quantum physics-inspired tensor networks. The ability of tensor networks to represent the probabilistic nature of quantum states as well as to reduce large state spaces makes tensor networks a natural candidate for active inference. We show how tensor networks can be used as a generative model for sequential data. Furthermore, we show how one can obtain beliefs from such a generative model and how an active inference agent can use these to compute the expected free energy. Finally, we demonstrate our method on the classic T-maze environment.", "authors": [{"name": "Samuel T. Wauthier", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "B.

{"title": "Successor Representation Active Inference", "abstract": "Recent work has uncovered close links between between classical reinforcement learning algorithms, Bayesian ﬁltering, and Active Inference which lets us understand value functions in terms of Bayesian posteriors. An alternative, but less explored, model-free RL algorithm is the successor representation, which expresses the value function in terms of a successor matrix of expected future state occupancies. In this paper, we derive the probabilistic interpretation of the successor representation in terms of Bayesian ﬁltering and thus design a novel active inference agent architecture utilizing successor representations instead of model-based planning. We demonstrate that active inference successor representations have signiﬁcant advantages over current active inference agents in terms of planning horizon and computational cost. Moreover, we demonstrate how the successor representation agent can generalize to changing reward functions such as variants of the expected free energy.", "authors": [{"name": "Beren Millidge", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "C.

{"title": "A neural active inference model of perceptual-motor learning", "abstract": "The active inference framework (AIF) is a promising new computational framework grounded in contemporary neuroscience that can produce human-like behavior through reward-based learning. In this study, we test the ability for the AIF to capture the role of anticipation in the visual guidance of action in humans through the systematic investigation of a visual-motor task that has been well-explored—that of intercepting a target moving over a ground plane. Previous research demonstrated that humans performing this task resorted to anticipatory changes in speed intended to compensate for semi-predictable changes in target speed later in the approach. To capture this behavior, our proposed “neural” AIF agent uses artificial neural networks to select actions on the basis of a very short term prediction of the information about the task environment that these actions would reveal along with a long-term estimate of the resulting cumulative expected free energy. Systematic variation revealed that anticipatory behavior emerged only when required by limitations on the agent's movement capabilities, and only when the agent was able to estimate accumulated free energy over sufficiently long durations into the future. In addition, we present a novel formulation of the prior mapping function that maps a multi-dimensional world-state to a uni-dimensional distribution of free-energy/reward.

{"title": "Active inference and cognitive control: Balancing deliberation and habits through precision optimization.", "abstract": "We advance a novel formulation of cognitive control within the active inference framework. The theory proposes that cognitive control amounts to optimising a precision parameter, which acts as a control signal and balances the contributions of deliberative and habitual components of action selection. To illustrate the theory, we simulate a driving scenario in which the driver follows a well-known route, but encounters unexpected challenges. Our simulations show that a standard active inference model can form adaptive habits; i.e., can pass from deliberative to habitual control when the context is stable, but generally fails to revert to deliberative control, when the context changes. To address this failure of context-sensitivity, we introduce a novel type of hierarchical active inference, in which a lower level is responsible for behavioural control and the higher (or meta-cognitive) level observes the belief updating of the lower level below and is responsible for cognitive control. Crucially, the meta-cognitive level can both form habits and suspend them, by controlling the (precision) parameter that prioritizes deliberative choices at the behavioural level. Furthermore, we show that several processes linked to cognitive control - such as surprise detection, cognitive conflict monitoring, control signal regulation and specification, the simulation of future outcomes and the assessment of the costs of control and mental effort - stem coherently from the free energy minimization scheme that underpins active inference. Finally, we discuss the putative neurobiology of cognitive control by simulating brain dynamics in the mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways of the dopamine system, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and the locus coeruleus.", "authors": [{"name": "Riccardo Proietti", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Thomas Parr", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Alessia Tessari", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Karl J.

{"title": "Branching Time Active Inference: the theory and its generality", "abstract": "Over the last 10 to 15 years, active inference has helped to explain various brain mechanisms from habit formation to dopaminergic discharge and even modelling curiosity. However, the current implementations suffer from an exponential (space and time) complexity class when computing the prior over all the possible policies up to the time-horizon. Fountas et al. (2020) used Monte Carlo tree search to address this problem, leading to impressive results in two different tasks. In this paper, we present an alternative framework that aims to unify tree search and active inference by casting planning as a structure learning problem. Two tree search algorithms are then presented. The first propagates the expected free energy forward in time (i.e., towards the leaves), while the second propagates it backward (i.e., towards the root). Then, we demonstrate that forward and backward propagations are related to active inference and sophisticated inference, respectively, thereby clarifying the differences between those two planning strategies.", "authors": [{"name": "T.

{"title": "Scaling Active Inference", "abstract": "In reinforcement learning (RL), agents often operate in partially observed and uncertain environments. Model-based RL suggests that this is best achieved by learning and exploiting a probabilistic model of the world. ‘Active inference’ is an emerging normative framework in cognitive and computational neuroscience that offers a unifying account of how biological agents achieve this. On this framework, inference, learning and action emerge from a single imperative to maximize the Bayesian evidence for a niched model of the world. However, implementations of this process have thus far been restricted to low-dimensional and idealized situations. Here, we present a working implementation of active inference that applies to high-dimensional tasks, with proof-of-principle results demonstrating efficient exploration and an order of magnitude increase in sample efficiency over strong model-free baselines.

{"title": "Fault-tolerant Control of Robot Manipulators with Sensory Faults using Unbiased Active Inference", "abstract": "This work presents a novel fault-tolerant control scheme based on active inference. Specifically, a new formulation of active inference which, unlike previous solutions, provides unbiased state estimation and simplifies the definition of probabilistically robust thresholds for fault-tolerant control of robotic systems using the free-energy. The proposed solution makes use of the sensory prediction errors in the free-energy for the generation of residuals and thresholds for fault detection and isolation of sensory faults, and it does not require additional controllers for fault recovery. Results validating the benefits in a simulated 2-DOF manipulator are presented, and future directions to improve the current fault recovery approach are discussed.", "authors": [{"name": "Mohamed Baioumy", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Corrado Pezzato", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Riccardo M.

{"title": "Active Inference: Applicability to Different Types of Social Organization Explained through Reference to Industrial Engineering and Quality Management", "abstract": "Active inference is a physics of life process theory of perception, action and learning that is applicable to natural and artificial agents. In this paper, active inference theory is related to different types of practice in social organization. Here, the term social organization is used to clarify that this paper does not encompass organization in biological systems. Rather, the paper addresses active inference in social organization that utilizes industrial engineering, quality management, and artificial intelligence alongside human intelligence. Social organization referred to in this paper can be in private companies, public institutions, other for-profit or not-for-profit organizations, and any combination of them. The relevance of active inference theory is explained in terms of variational free energy, prediction errors, generative models, and Markov blankets. Active inference theory is most relevant to the social organization of work that is highly repetitive. By contrast, there are more challenges involved in applying active inference theory for social organization of less repetitive endeavors such as one-of-a-kind projects. These challenges need to be addressed in order for active inference to provide a unifying framework for different types of social organization employing human and artificial intelligence.", "authors": [{"name": "S.

{"title": "Deep Active Inference Agents for Delayed and Long-Horizon Environments", "abstract": "With the recent success of world-model agents, which extend the core idea of model-based reinforcement learning by learning a differentiable model for sample-efficient control across diverse tasks, active inference (AIF) offers a complementary, neuroscience-grounded paradigm that unifies perception, learning, and action within a single probabilistic framework powered by a generative model. Despite this promise, practical AIF agents still rely on accurate immediate predictions and exhaustive planning, a limitation that is exacerbated in delayed environments requiring plans over long horizons, tens to hundreds of steps. Moreover, most existing agents are evaluated on robotic or vision benchmarks which, while natural for biological agents, fall short of real-world industrial complexity. We address these limitations with a generative-policy architecture featuring (i) a multi-step latent transition that lets the generative model predict an entire horizon in a single look-ahead, (ii) an integrated policy network that enables the transition and receives gradients of the expected free energy, (iii) an alternating optimization scheme that updates model and policy from a replay buffer, and (iv) a single gradient step that plans over long horizons, eliminating exhaustive planning from the control loop. We evaluate our agent in an environment that mimics a realistic industrial scenario with delayed and long-horizon settings. The empirical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach, demonstrating the coupled world-model with the AIF formalism yields an end-to-end probabilistic controller capable of effective decision making in delayed, long-horizon settings without handcrafted rewards or expensive planning.", "authors": [{"name": "Yavar Yeganeh", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Mohsen A.

{"title": "The Missing Reward: Active Inference in the Era of Experience", "abstract": "This paper argues that Active Inference (AIF) provides a crucial foundation for developing autonomous AI agents capable of learning from experience without continuous human reward engineering. As AI systems begin to exhaust high-quality training data and rely on increasingly large human workforces for reward design, the current paradigm faces significant scalability challenges that could impede progress toward genuinely autonomous intelligence. The proposal for an ``Era of Experience,''where agents learn from self-generated data, is a promising step forward. However, this vision still depends on extensive human engineering of reward functions, effectively shifting the bottleneck from data curation to reward curation. This highlights what we identify as the \\textbf{grounded-agency gap}: the inability of contemporary AI systems to autonomously formulate, adapt, and pursue objectives in response to changing circumstances. We propose that AIF can bridge this gap by replacing external reward signals with an intrinsic drive to minimize free energy, allowing agents to naturally balance exploration and exploitation through a unified Bayesian objective. By integrating Large Language Models as generative world models with AIF's principled decision-making framework, we can create agents that learn efficiently from experience while remaining aligned with human values. This synthesis offers a compelling path toward AI systems that can develop autonomously while adhering to both computational and physical constraints.", "authors": [{"name": "Bo Wen", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2025, "doi": "10.48550/arXiv.2508.05619", "arxiv_id": "2508.05619", "s2_id": "58de3ea51b5e97d543524466c6afbd609fc1c036", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "arXiv.org", "citation_count": 1, "references": ["s2:be8f1cdd0365a2b50ada35219592bcc7abc00009", "s2:5329cea2b868ce408163420e6af7e9bd00a1940c", "s2:d32ba88571141ed0ebe7aeefbaa4ccaf8cda7be3", "s2:d4bf36cbc5855ea87235d7a64f406717ac6aa3c9", "s2:38939304bb760473141c2aca0305e44fbe04e6e8", "s2:7d97c17a75beb89f938eaac1d3ca60ac2245fb2e", "s2:3cbffab9d7981da6662d474aaa056dcbd3c1701e", "s2:6cf65eb8aa66116e14a97bb8f71552359ff814ba", "s2:d88a5ae1673f2009704186acf2890163e6ddf4ca", "s2:10bd4160b44803ada6a3d2e366c44b7e2a4ffe90", "s2:3a1501829ce7205f25939dd26e1089df920c9988", "s2:7a16d9b4e04300d034502dc7dd58428714594e2c", "s2:1eecf3b4255909953a2a8973411ea47ce8d054a6", "s2:cda5d891ae6262c55c8711ef5b18ccc1fe748d7a", "s2:1e2db47d023539e81ff996069aa2208d441408e8", "s2:d17c6cb9c0d8ec64ce8d1eff653ac72b15df683a", "s2:77dce9a53befd88c399ae17b206de931347859e1", "s2:def8207fb6457f3c2656bac9f2bbf954de1d7de1", "s2:f9717d29840f4d8f1cc19d1b1e80c5d12ec40608", "s2:ff332c21562c87cab5891d495b7d0956f2d9228b", "s2:4aa65bbc0da30f1f761722f5db7d3bffd49ea29b", "s2:c219439493dc8a95331516995e64d5726f241d72", "s2:754b657330b1674d3453e8254d3a664db5222b3b", "s2:be9aa6c68d4df56a55444b15a83ff1e62c869bb5", "s2:cea967b59209c6be22829699f05b8b1ac4dc092d", "s2:407bb3034daac0fb4fba3d4c09ef3a26dfbfcf5f", "s2:1ed6a4a10589618d4f26350f1a296ee767ceff6b", "s2:9c78302097bd9abdc510492e7848950d922bef63", "s2:0fdd66fcf6b9bc04428e337df66fd510a659eb2f", "s2:7bea855e19fd13461590e4f2d44bbf7b807ce3e3", "s2:59c60fc1106235ca102473fa1fd0db46e618c6a4", "s2:9b608a6c80271cc996f22f584f9da4c43e354f45"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "A Framework for Inherently Safer AGI through Language-Mediated Active Inference", "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel framework for developing safe Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) by combining Active Inference principles with Large Language Models (LLMs). We argue that traditional approaches to AI safety, focused on post-hoc interpretability and reward engineering, have fundamental limitations. We present an architecture where safety guarantees are integrated into the system's core design through transparent belief representations and hierarchical value alignment. Our framework leverages natural language as a medium for representing and manipulating beliefs, enabling direct human oversight while maintaining computational tractability. The architecture implements a multi-agent system where agents self-organize according to Active Inference principles, with preferences and safety constraints flowing through hierarchical Markov blankets. We outline specific mechanisms for ensuring safety, including: (1) explicit separation of beliefs and preferences in natural language, (2) bounded rationality through resource-aware free energy minimization, and (3) compositional safety through modular agent structures. The paper concludes with a research agenda centered on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) benchmark, proposing experiments to validate our framework's safety properties. Our approach offers a path toward AGI development that is inherently safer, rather than retrofitted with safety measures.", "authors": [{"name": "Bo Wen", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2025, "doi": "10.48550/arXiv.2508.05766", "arxiv_id": "2508.05766", "s2_id": "2338f6c764bb3284620b896d326f443cb038b92c", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "arXiv.org", "citation_count": 1, "references": ["s2:cf36c0c47e1f1a9bb5285c638bdd77244113bbae", "s2:6edd112383ad494f5f2eba72b6f4ffae122ce61f", "s2:d766bffc357127e0dc86dd69561d5aeb520d6f4c", "s2:49f905eb03958c7cfae52ac759ea8978b8b2a6ea", "s2:1eecf3b4255909953a2a8973411ea47ce8d054a6", "s2:00d385a359eda4845dab37efc7c12a9c0987e66b", "s2:90abbc2cf38462b954ae1b772fac9532e2ccd8b0", "s2:a0cfd36e6c7abf070f492ae52a35af895a1c5592", "s2:d17c6cb9c0d8ec64ce8d1eff653ac72b15df683a", "s2:6df2126301ab415aed034b0bcd9589b1897fe983", "s2:7ee12d3bf8e0ce20d281b4550e39a1ee53839452", "s2:d09bec5af4eef5038e48b26b6c14098f95997114", "s2:c27db32efa8137cbf654902f8f728f338e55cd1c", "s2:754b657330b1674d3453e8254d3a664db5222b3b", "s2:120331bd16cd69161973f9aff6799ae17be09a29", "s2:eb4ca1f967d48fb8583e63a721d4ce2875be093d", "s2:c42779ec81a827aaec882e35993262b2cfc3758f", "s2:e86f71ca2948d17b003a5f068db1ecb2b77827f7", "s2:57620e357ee348cd5ffa8eafa480e002a2aba06a", "s2:defe4585fd20817ba121287456fe83112d9582f7", "s2:fbccf55a60da8e1caeb008442b4332e7c45da134", "s2:ff39afafacaff0f18ae8b954720fa4256659e4b1", "s2:ccbed319e0500ebefe0052a91406ebd034e29bb6", "s2:42998f6a0ef243ffb5555ced81319ea5e8bba788", "s2:f48eed915cbb9c6592cdb9df80c1edaeb46959af", "s2:17afa3e887894de3d319d08122cdad8c52e8a78b", "s2:407bb3034daac0fb4fba3d4c09ef3a26dfbfcf5f", "s2:1ed6a4a10589618d4f26350f1a296ee767ceff6b", "s2:f01f41d04b3b9ef19b97d965ac7298dc1fb96628", "s2:1616e67bccf41b68400b67f29175801b76b621dd", "s2:0473a64f61a47be428b05a42c590e78da86c18d5", "s2:e4c8d1b7548aa257dc8d7600d9e774f7ae6537aa", "s2:7abcc4de0eeadfce4caaa067919aa32cdd56920c", "s2:7bea855e19fd13461590e4f2d44bbf7b807ce3e3", "s2:c7ea0180493704068b3bfdcce61621744e753bcc"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Active Inference and Behavior Trees for Reactive Action Planning and Execution in Robotics", "abstract": "In this article, we propose a hybrid combination of active inference and behavior trees (BTs) for reactive action planning and execution in dynamic environments, showing how robotic tasks can be formulated as a free-energy minimization problem. The proposed approach allows handling partially observable initial states and improves the robustness of classical BTs against unexpected contingencies while at the same time reducing the number of nodes in a tree. In this work, we specify the nominal behavior offline, through BTs. However, in contrast to previous approaches, we introduce a new type of leaf node to specify the desired state to be achieved rather than an action to execute. The decision of which action to execute to reach the desired state is performed online through active inference. This results in continual online planning and hierarchical deliberation. By doing so, an agent can follow a predefined offline plan while still keeping the ability to locally adapt and take autonomous decisions at runtime, respecting safety constraints. We provide proof of convergence and robustness analysis, and we validate our method in two different mobile manipulators performing similar tasks, both in a simulated and real retail environment. The results showed improved runtime adaptability with a fraction of the hand-coded nodes compared to classical BTs.", "authors": [{"name": "Corrado Pezzato", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "C.

{"title": "Canonical neural networks perform active inference", "abstract": "This work considers a class of canonical neural networks comprising rate coding models, wherein neural activity and plasticity minimise a common cost function—and plasticity is modulated with a certain delay. We show that such neural networks implicitly perform active inference and learning to minimise the risk associated with future outcomes. Mathematical analyses demonstrate that this biological optimisation can be cast as maximisation of model evidence, or equivalently minimisation of variational free energy, under the well-known form of a partially observed Markov decision process model. This equivalence indicates that the delayed modulation of Hebbian plasticity—accompanied with adaptation of firing thresholds—is a sufficient neuronal substrate to attain Bayes optimal inference and control. We corroborated this proposition using numerical analyses of maze tasks. This theory offers a universal characterisation of canonical neural networks in terms of Bayesian belief updating and provides insight into the neuronal mechanisms underlying planning and adaptive behavioural control.

{"title": "Active Inference, Curiosity and Insight", "abstract": "This article offers a formal account of curiosity and insight in terms of active (Bayesian) inference. It deals with the dual problem of inferring states of the world and learning its statistical structure. In contrast to current trends in machine learning (e.g., deep learning), we focus on how people attain insight and understanding using just a handful of observations, which are solicited through curious behavior. We use simulations of abstract rule learning and approximate Bayesian inference to show that minimizing (expected) variational free energy leads to active sampling of novel contingencies. This epistemic behavior closes explanatory gaps in generative models of the world, thereby reducing uncertainty and satisfying curiosity. We then move from epistemic learning to model selection or structure learning to show how abductive processes emerge when agents test plausible hypotheses about symmetries (i.e., invariances or rules) in their generative models. The ensuing Bayesian model reduction evinces mechanisms associated with sleep and has all the hallmarks of “aha” moments.

Up to now, the inference of the latent variables was carried out by taking advantage of the flexibility offered by variational message passing, an iterative process that can be understood as sending messages along the edges of a factor graph. In this letter, we harness the efficiency of an alternative method for inference, Bayesian filtering, which does not require the iteration of the update equations until convergence of the variational free energy. Instead, this scheme alternates between two phases: integration of evidence and prediction of future states. Both phases can be performed efficiently, and this provides a forty times speedup over the state of the art.", "authors": [{"name": "Théophile Champion", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Marek Grze's", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "H.

{"title": "Embodied decisions as active inference", "abstract": "Decision-making is often conceptualized as a serial process, during which sensory evidence is accumulated for the choice alternatives until a certain threshold is reached, at which point a decision is made and an action is executed. This decide-then-act perspective has successfully explained various facets of perceptual and economic decisions in the laboratory, in which action dynamics are usually irrelevant to the choice. However, living organisms often face another class of decisions – called embodied decisions – that require selecting between potential courses of actions to be executed timely in a dynamic environment, e.g., for a lion, deciding which gazelle to chase and how fast to do so. Studies of embodied decisions reveal two aspects of goal-directed behavior in stark contrast to the serial view. First, that decision and action processes can unfold in parallel; second, that action-related components, such as the motor costs associated with selecting a particular choice alternative or required to “change mind” between choice alternatives, exert a feedback effect on the decision taken. Here, we show that these signatures of embodied decisions emerge naturally in active inference – a framework that simultaneously optimizes perception and action, according to the same (free energy minimization) imperative. We show that optimizing embodied choices requires a continuous feedback loop between motor planning (where beliefs about choice alternatives guide action dynamics) and motor inference (where action dynamics finesse beliefs about choice alternatives). Furthermore, our active inference simulations reveal the normative character of embodied decisions in ecological settings – namely, achieving an effective balance between a high accuracy and a low risk of missing valid opportunities. Author summary In this study, we introduce a novel modeling approach to explore embodied decision-making, where decisions and actions occur simultaneously in dynamic environments. Unlike traditional models that treat decision and action as separate, our framework, based on active inference, reveals that crucial features of embodied decisions – such as feedback loops between decision and action dynamics – emerge naturally. By simulating real-time decision-making tasks, we show how organisms continuously refine their choices by integrating sensory information and motor dynamics. This allows them to strike a balance between decision accuracy and the need for fast, adaptive actions. Our model offers a new perspective on how decisions are influenced by the actions taken, highlighting the importance of considering motor control as an integral part of decision processes. This approach broadens the scope of decision-making research and provides new insights into behavior in ecologically valid, time-sensitive contexts, with potential implications for neuroscience, cognitive science, and fields involving human and animal behavior.", "authors": [{"name": "Matteo Priorelli", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Ivilin Peev Stoianov", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Giovanni Pezzulo", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2025, "doi": "10.1101/2024.05.28.596181", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": "ff1b9a61fbd51c96cf45318b793aa71f91a99a3b", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "bioRxiv", "citation_count": 8, "references": ["s2:f45b61a7322acffbfae77a76f19eb54791f157a9", "s2:883d2bb61d044925723bc45401679602388b75d6", "s2:e36509babfc4cf04c4a309bbd9f24729e3d8ea80", "s2:0d598b16582e344ee621f469787af85b467c78a8", "s2:dded71d2681fb42c1d149286b636b066ab6a0910", "s2:35f6f6ce7ba3228634f2f084c26213067b80976f", "s2:9dd502407a46a74797d945038652462c6f8f659d", "s2:5c02012893b1ee778ecd96d2aff18e27133b06ca", "s2:1e206726e13b854302796590de239327172eb3b4", "s2:c3829409915c802108c329a22598bee2924cecee", "s2:ba5a1cbf7f4ed8ba5cf2a6f4115688cd0c825a96", "s2:dc19db213c1d73a60d9dd18096b8e56d97943a94", "s2:a335cf4bf4b8a07c5547807adbaa6a081d4aa9b7", "s2:a333aef920c09b4de2becc9d934dc4c41e231847", "s2:3425f6f3d524fcdbe0172f901ee6cc51df6b10c3", "s2:113ed2dbb5df54532c28c58977e6f4ab815531f1", "s2:ff099ae352c650f17b1cd19469f68aee97e1355b", "s2:5024ac8e3443dea222167d6da5c314f4dfe87d06", "s2:a727b0d6fe97696da72be28725f47a2d3cdd09cd", "s2:6567e6f5ae1a1caaef96a5b231eee7042fab2b8d", "s2:16aef42d9b453dad02a7aba750825bcb6e049bc1", "s2:8c706717238433f88c5a27e384759835888662e1", "s2:d6055ae74dad73395c594a7f515f7001c1e5cbde", "s2:ac75529b63c686d7989f523c2b4b487b1f3660e0", "s2:32dc2670c63351be9ef6f8a716c8718e7cd0e91f", "s2:a934a3a7f171d494556a80d31f7bf4b637376c71", "s2:aaf4ad6cfeef9d6838e2d75dc44bc1ed88c95f6c", "s2:5cc8ffb1b8cc3a08717bd018a35ca392a85408d5", "s2:8f13e5676e5e035dc657a76250a90d94634e4dda", "s2:bdba2d26e60a60a11738718e591e0bc5e6d9085e", "s2:1a12b046ef8116ece47d58f93a8c77114f28d950", "s2:a15bb35896648c84a6e94cc7b264da835771ecd6", "s2:1c167b1ce9928d46259937bb13dbc2c6ef7aed8f", "s2:5066e7e7bd0fd2735d6793dca8519bd024d90013", "s2:827a073c0b2d742962918b715f33f2880888f3bf", "s2:5414e6066f5497383f90825caeaf9f082efac746", "s2:09c05f75e88dcbf417eb57c5c3771305c44b4918", "s2:654b36000eccf157a9e1f3080b921763a218282a", "s2:252e94ff9f396be57345038807e4528d37b2ea88", "s2:2a42d205c706324a1641cebe60b6389ac90b5dbf", "s2:d74bc360096ed0f2b65d64b14046bc51bbd58115", "s2:4d7d77ce8a4fe586ff8e2c103401ca4eb418beb2", "s2:35fbfd8f16548e444556a9e0f8000d422fb3a714", "s2:7125d6ee7d9b0d76e2f7834ecc82c8e9e8ec7298", "s2:8bc87d35214752422e62a14006d17b1442f1fdfc", "s2:76f5f07ad02772baf50138b2153dbbbab030bd60", "s2:f4f403ed373408d2e84c441b8a2b2b4a35c27ba8", "s2:17b7e0b33847ca1c0546f714b75bdd768263b267", "s2:2ba788647916f6206f7fcc137fe7866c58e6211e", "s2:0d63b6a1d3ae93f3c279fc09d4b8b58e874f8656", "s2:d8ca79626badba6da19de8d6dcee12bfeb8df130", "s2:0dbf1089f3a353b675ac21dc52da64630930756b", "s2:ccc87e174d4763f70e1d3277d3e0ebf54a3e4fce", "s2:03cbad7e7d88c3d4aafbe96af8ae3dade3772963", "s2:1c2226d9eba78ddf37ec68f4d6763317b42ac20d", "s2:f53ea0c92240e92ff870869a5234f2468ed0aa1d", "s2:1e98951ed8132415c6a5329ce083dd56c5d3d543", "s2:407bb3034daac0fb4fba3d4c09ef3a26dfbfcf5f", "s2:1ed6a4a10589618d4f26350f1a296ee767ceff6b", "s2:91c96718e77d5ce575dda517d7c74985df3943a1", "s2:2bbf5e577d57100b6c29bd1a8312bc7d6683f0c9", "s2:026c135433809abd331b2ff69e35bb6c6dc6bbff", "s2:6927ea92b0d759a75f0f696fa028155d6d9ee2ca", "s2:1df88f9f0e599b79b1fef6d1bc8dd46271844a0a", "s2:59cf698630a4aa25e5772a199a5d4745eae48156", "s2:1dccc2d2207d25b4d7bde33d74f33b9ec97f0eaf", "s2:23c599774ba843b22c7177de1415f289521d7c68", "s2:7d4de1ad7c100a27cf1b72f29544f800e8eeebe3", "s2:66f881a623662f52bb1f84297a098da6b4fa125b", "s2:1c53f6fdcef2afa88afe77332a9aa0ba2eb347a8", "s2:b60e3ab7c0c89a8639d5555cc4e69fd9cba729d2", "s2:e63a419b1bafef66181087380a89188a6105fc3b", "s2:2a4e9d7d9be677b3f2da8316cb1c2368ce260654", "s2:3cbead20fdeb3d85835be14b225965039722c83b", "s2:ab01cdba07ffc7163ea53640965e0057025a5456", "s2:255a77422b1da74da05d1714b7875356187385bd", "s2:2575f6dfdda31baddff89640174649153b67c5dc", "s2:da3e4a8ad14b66c60e838def7ad4ed656190969b", "s2:5a6fbac8246d01aa9d3356b79d001ce660fc718a"], "publication_date": null}

This amounts to the claim that non-equilibrium steady-state dynamics—that underwrite our climate—depend on the Earth system possessing a Markov blanket. Our formalization rests on how the metabolic rates of the biosphere (understood as Markov blanket's internal states) change with respect to solar radiation at the Earth's surface (i.e. external states), through the changes in greenhouse and albedo effects (i.e. active states) and ocean-driven global temperature changes (i.e. sensory states).

{"title": "Active Inference for Integrated State-Estimation, Control, and Learning", "abstract": "This work presents an approach for control, state-estimation and learning model (hyper)parameters for robotic manipulators. It is based on the active inference framework, prominent in computational neuroscience as a theory of the brain, where behaviour arises from minimizing variational free-energy. First, we show there is a direct relationship between active inference controllers, and classic methods such as PID control. We demonstrate its application for adaptive and robust behaviour of a robotic manipulator that rivals state-of-the-art. Additionally, we show that by learning specific hyperparameters, our approach can deal with unmodeled dynamics, damps oscillations, and is robust against poor initial parameters. The approach is validated on the ‘Franka Emika Panda’ 7 DoF manipulator. Finally, we highlight limitations of active inference controllers for robotic systems.", "authors": [{"name": "Mohamed Baioumy", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Paul Duckworth", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Bruno Lacerda", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Nick Hawes", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9562009", "arxiv_id": "2005.05894", "s2_id": "5bfe60370082a615a5430d0ed7fdfda626e84384", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation", "citation_count": 33, "references": ["s2:57c444c070bc709d176432913d2b30a9627cac25", "s2:c1e52f979eae907f82590d0a19ded090e1eaccb9", "s2:0f1440184094a1fc3483fbc2d36eae2e1c88851d", "s2:43cc239f89a010dac5fe32bda0fc1917f2a5965d", "s2:4790ad7643318714e1596f2ad44de995a8b678ae", "s2:1dc4001974f99122610964b3731882cca9c228a0", "s2:995413f533ba19bbf543d30b8f3a0461fc11bbd4", "s2:96f2c2e57fd1256c35d26054174a4599f23bb4e7", "s2:80e2acd8aef9671ba5f23007a9dec35414bce304", "s2:c05a7713cb11441435b573e881a1756cfe4804cf", "s2:bdba2d26e60a60a11738718e591e0bc5e6d9085e", "s2:e07a66d2b115c802a2f9e1a2db3a728afec5daff", "s2:81cb1f2ffb671279f7ff09c03619481b078c050f", "s2:de40e3b95711fbf75ebf10a3df741619b4e759bb", "s2:754b657330b1674d3453e8254d3a664db5222b3b", "s2:57070167d647bfa23bc5c5895623af13576db66b", "s2:6b1687bb4d87513a4301685d5332423ed962ed3b", "s2:7f0def1a06618e964a04ad6af9af01de66d3b9f3", "s2:4135230c8df9248dcd3bdf1f9aab312757bafd9a", "s2:79c43724a1f7c9071ba75e0aedd86f907590e0d0", "s2:51ae6b42bd339e5bcf935dada5d67cf15cd08ff3", "s2:a878886efacc6a5d742bf98bfc25c0734ce502b1", "s2:d98d0d1900b13b87aa4ffd6b69c046beb63f0434", "s2:2eacb358ba2c06a8706a58ed60c3a6a06d38fec0", "s2:1a014a076cac3c7f5d81a084e296c095f9230437", "s2:3c3fbadbcfe98e3dd096865948c486bb3b3ac386", "s2:51c52d7a4335f5e40465c9677e19eda69c5760cf", "s2:668b1277fbece28c4841eeab1c97e4ebd0079700", "s2:5bf0f07a364c17a9edafda47941b202b121ba580", "s2:5794f07b2ce5a04241198d42e81623380d2c7e2e", "s2:ce87e556e5104056025daa3666c41f9e82188df6", "s2:d0ff7eb3bee6e341b5924e8c359e0e8f2bb386b0", "s2:f1080801e567fda66c016d861a1f7a3e9aaed63a", "s2:e177b21b0a7f43ad3969ceb42bd8f1d912ea8d43", "s2:e6ec232c3093227e18c273703b8233592d86a96c", "s2:0fdd66fcf6b9bc04428e337df66fd510a659eb2f", "s2:1bf971999e0357905fbb2bf4f4ed8798041bdb81", "s2:329705a255360c8f86a10d909a92794ed8a0857a", "s2:aff25f5a6c89cbab5fee0f053281ad4b14b3f888", "s2:255a77422b1da74da05d1714b7875356187385bd", "s2:610851562e61cdc7300aaf1008a24966e06aac26", "s2:a95e62745006d36dd1b49e1d147672acf029de9e", "s2:ffe750128a06610193097f29e0056310a8d3a9ce"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Deep Active Inference and Scene Construction", "abstract": "Adaptive agents must act in intrinsically uncertain environments with complex latent structure. Here, we elaborate a model of visual foraging – in a hierarchical context – wherein agents infer a higher-order visual pattern (a ‘scene’) by sequentially sampling ambiguous cues. Inspired by previous models of scene construction – that cast perception and action as consequences of approximate Bayesian inference – we use active inference to simulate decisions of agents categorizing a scene in a hierarchically-structured setting. Under active inference, agents develop probabilistic beliefs about their environment, while actively sampling it to maximise the evidence for their internal generative model. This approximate evidence maximization (i.e. self-evidencing) comprises drives to both maximise rewards and resolve uncertainty about hidden states. This is realised via minimization of a free energy functional of posterior beliefs about both the world as well as the actions used to sample or perturb it, corresponding to perception and action, respectively. We show that active inference, in the context of hierarchical scene construction, gives rise to many empirical evidence accumulation phenomena, such as noise-sensitive reaction times and epistemic saccades. We explain these behaviours in terms of the principled drives that constitute the expected free energy, the key quantity for evaluating policies under active inference. In addition, we report novel behaviours exhibited by these active inference agents that furnish new predictions for research on evidence accumulation and perceptual decision-making. We discuss the implications of this hierarchical active inference scheme for tasks that require planned sequences of information-gathering actions to infer compositional latent structure (such as visual scene construction and sentence comprehension). Finally, we propose experiments to contextualise active inference in relation to other formulations of evidence accumulation (e.g. drift-diffusion models) in tasks that require planning in uncertain environments with higher-order structure.", "authors": [{"name": "R.

{"title": "Factorised Active Inference for Strategic Multi-Agent Interactions", "abstract": "Understanding how individual agents make strategic decisions within collectives is important for advancing fields as diverse as economics, neuroscience, and multi-agent systems. Two complementary approaches can be integrated to this end. The Active Inference framework (AIF) describes how agents employ a generative model to adapt their beliefs about and behaviour within their environment. Game theory formalises strategic interactions between agents with potentially competing objectives. To bridge the gap between the two, we propose a factorisation of the generative model whereby each agent maintains explicit, individual-level beliefs about the internal states of other agents, and uses them for strategic planning in a joint context. We apply our model to iterated general-sum games with two and three players, and study the ensemble effects of game transitions, where the agents' preferences (game payoffs) change over time. This non-stationarity, beyond that caused by reciprocal adaptation, reflects a more naturalistic environment in which agents need to adapt to changing social contexts. Finally, we present a dynamical analysis of key AIF quantities: the variational free energy (VFE) and the expected free energy (EFE) from numerical simulation data. The ensemble-level EFE allows us to characterise the basins of attraction of games with multiple Nash Equilibria under different conditions, and we find that it is not necessarily minimised at the aggregate level. By integrating AIF and game theory, we can gain deeper insights into how intelligent collectives emerge, learn, and optimise their actions in dynamic environments, both cooperative and non-cooperative.", "authors": [{"name": "Jaime Ruiz-Serra", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Patrick Sweeney", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Michael S.

{"title": "Whence the Expected Free Energy?", "abstract": "The expected free energy (EFE) is a central quantity in the theory of active inference. It is the quantity that all active inference agents are mandated to minimize through action, and its decomposition into extrinsic and intrinsic value terms is key to the balance of exploration and exploitation that active inference agents evince. Despite its importance, the mathematical origins of this quantity and its relation to the variational free energy (VFE) remain unclear. In this letter, we investigate the origins of the EFE in detail and show that it is not simply ”the free energy in the future.” We present a functional that we argue is the natural extension of the VFE but actively discourages exploratory behavior, thus demonstrating that exploration does not directly follow from free energy minimization into the future.

{"title": "Active Inference, Belief Propagation, and the Bethe Approximation", "abstract": "When modeling goal-directed behavior in the presence of various sources of uncertainty, planning can be described as an inference process. A solution to the problem of planning as inference was previously proposed in the active inference framework in the form of an approximate inference scheme based on variational free energy. However, this approximate scheme was based on the mean-field approximation, which assumes statistical independence of hidden variables and is known to show overconfidence and may converge to local minima of the free energy. To better capture the spatiotemporal properties of an environment, we reformulated the approximate inference process using the so-called Bethe approximation. Importantly, the Bethe approximation allows for representation of pairwise statistical dependencies. Under these assumptions, the minimizer of the variational free energy corresponds to the belief propagation algorithm, commonly used in machine learning. To illustrate the differences between the mean-field approximation and the Bethe approximation, we have simulated agent behavior in a simple goal-reaching task with different types of uncertainties. Overall, the Bethe agent achieves higher success rates in reaching goal states. We relate the better performance of the Bethe agent to more accurate predictions about the consequences of its own actions. Consequently, active inference based on the Bethe approximation extends the application range of active inference to more complex behavioral tasks.", "authors": [{"name": "Sarah Schwöbel", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "S.

{"title": "Batman: Bayesian Target Modelling For Active Inference", "abstract": "Active Inference is an emerging framework for designing intelligent agents. In an Active Inference setting, any task is formulated as a variational free energy minimisation problem on a generative probabilistic model. Goal-directed behaviour relies on a clear specification of desired future observations. Learning desired observations would open up the Active Inference approach to problems where these are difficult to specify a priori. This paper introduces the BAyesian Target Modelling for Active iNference (BATMAN) approach, which augments an Active Inference agent with an additional, separate model that learns desired future observations from a separate data source. The main contribution of this paper is the design of a coupled generative model structure that facilitates learning desired future observations for Active Inference agents and supports integration of Active Inference and classical methods in a joint framework.

{"title": "Anomaly Detection via Controlled Sensing and Deep Active Inference", "abstract": "In this paper, we address the anomaly detection problem where the objective is to find the anomalous processes among a given set of processes. To this end, the decision-making agent probes a subset of processes at every time instant and obtains a potentially erroneous estimate of the binary variable which indicates whether or not the corresponding process is anomalous. The agent continues to probe the processes until it obtains a sufficient number of measurements to reliably identify the anomalous processes. In this context, we develop a sequential selection algorithm that decides which processes to be probed at every instant to detect the anomalies with an accuracy exceeding a desired value while minimizing the delay in making the decision and the total number of measurements taken. Our algorithm is based on active inference which is a general framework to make sequential decisions in order to maximize the notion of free energy. We define the free energy using the objectives of the selection policy and implement the active inference framework using a deep neural network approximation. Using numerical experiments, we compare our algorithm with the state-of-the-art method based on deep actor-critic reinforcement learning and demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithm.", "authors": [{"name": "Geethu Joseph", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Chen Zhong", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "M.

{"title": "On Epistemics in Expected Free Energy for Linear Gaussian State Space Models", "abstract": "Active Inference (AIF) is a framework that can be used both to describe information processing in naturally intelligent systems, such as the human brain, and to design synthetic intelligent systems (agents). In this paper we show that Expected Free Energy (EFE) minimisation, a core feature of the framework, does not lead to purposeful explorative behaviour in linear Gaussian dynamical systems. We provide a simple proof that, due to the specific construction used for the EFE, the terms responsible for the exploratory (epistemic) drive become constant in the case of linear Gaussian systems. This renders AIF equivalent to KL control. From a theoretical point of view this is an interesting result since it is generally assumed that EFE minimisation will always introduce an exploratory drive in AIF agents. While the full EFE objective does not lead to exploration in linear Gaussian dynamical systems, the principles of its construction can still be used to design objectives that include an epistemic drive. We provide an in-depth analysis of the mechanics behind the epistemic drive of AIF agents and show how to design objectives for linear Gaussian dynamical systems that do include an epistemic drive. Concretely, we show that focusing solely on epistemics and dispensing with goal-directed terms leads to a form of maximum entropy exploration that is heavily dependent on the type of control signals driving the system. Additive controls do not permit such exploration. From a practical point of view this is an important result since linear Gaussian dynamical systems with additive controls are an extensively used model class, encompassing for instance Linear Quadratic Gaussian controllers.

{"title": "Multiscale Free Energy Analysis of Human Ecosystem Engineering", "abstract": "Unlike ecosystem engineering by other living things, which brings a relatively limited range of sensations that are connected to a few enduring survival preferences, human ecosystem engineering brings an increasing variety and frequency of novel sensations. Many of these novel sensations can quickly become preferences as they indicate that human life will be less strenuous and more stimulating. Furthermore, they can soon become addictive. By contrast, unwanted surprise from these novel sensations may become apparent decades later. This recognition can come after the survival of millions of humans and other species has been undermined. In this paper, it is explained that, while multiscale free energy provides a useful hypothesis for framing human ecosystem engineering, disconnects between preferences and survival from human ecosystem engineering limit the application of current assumptions that underlie continuous state-space and discrete state-space modelling of active inference.", "authors": [{"name": "S.

{"title": "Calculation of CYP450 protein-ligand binding and dissociation free energy paths.", "abstract": "The function of an enzyme depends on its dynamic structure, and the catalytic mechanism has long been an active focus of research. The principle for interpreting protein selectivity and fidelity stems from optimization of the active site upon protein-substrate complexation, i.e., a lock-and-key configuration, on which most protein-substrate molecule binding recognition, and hence drug discovery, relies. Yet another thought has been to incorporate the protein folding interior tunnels for stereo- and regio-selectivity along the protein-substrate or protein-ligand/inhibitor binding process. Free energy calculations provide valuable information for molecular recognition and protein-ligand binding dynamics and kinetics. In this study, we focused on the kinetics of cytochrome P450 proteins (CYP450s) and the protein interior tunnel structure-dynamics relationship in terms of the substrate binding and leaving mechanism. A case in point is given by the prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) homologous isomerase of prostacyclin synthase. To calculate the reactant and product traversing the tunnels to and from the heme site, the free energy paths and tunnel potentials of mean force are constructed from steered molecular dynamics simulations and adaptive basing force umbrella sampling simulations. We explore the binding tunnels and critical residue lining characteristics for the ligand traverse and the underlying mechanism of CYP450 activity. Our theoretical analysis provides insights into the decisive role of the substrate tunnel binding process of the CYP450 mechanism and may be useful in drug design and protein engineering contexts.", "authors": [{"name": "Kuan-Hsuan Su", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Chin-Teng Wu", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Shang-Wei Lin", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "S.

{"title": "Intrinsic and extrinsic motivators of attachment under active inference", "abstract": "This paper addresses the formation of infant attachment types within the context of active inference: a holistic account of action, perception and learning in the brain. We show how the organised forms of attachment (secure, avoidant and ambivalent) might arise in (Bayesian) infants. Specifically, we show that these distinct forms of attachment emerge from a minimisation of free energy—over interoceptive states relating to internal stress levels—when seeking proximity to caregivers who have a varying impact on these interoceptive states. In line with empirical findings in disrupted patterns of affective communication, we then demonstrate how exteroceptive cues (in the form of caregiver-mediated AMBIANCE affective communication errors, ACE) can result in disorganised forms of attachment in infants of caregivers who consistently increase stress when the infant seeks proximity, but can have an organising (towards ambivalence) effect in infants of inconsistent caregivers. In particular, we differentiate disorganised attachment from avoidance in terms of the high epistemic value of proximity seeking behaviours (resulting from the caregiver’s misleading exteroceptive cues) that preclude the emergence of coherent and organised behavioural policies. Our work, the first to formulate infant attachment in terms of active inference, makes a new testable prediction with regards to the types of affective communication errors that engender ambivalent attachment.", "authors": [{"name": "David Cittern", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "T.

{"title": "Demystifying active inference", "abstract": "Active inference is a first (Bayesian) principles account of how autonomous agents might operate in dynamic, non-stationary environments. The optimization of congruent formulations of the free energy functional (variational and expected), in active inference, enables agents to make inferences about the environment and select optimal behaviors. The agent achieves this by evaluating (sensory) evidence in relation to its internal generative model that entails beliefs about future (hidden) states and sequence of actions that it can choose. In contrast to analogous frameworks $-$ by operating in a pure belief-based setting (free energy functional of beliefs about states) $-$ active inference agents can carry out epistemic exploration and naturally account for uncertainty about their environment. Through this review, we disambiguate these properties, by providing a condensed overview of the theory underpinning active inference. A T-maze simulation is used to demonstrate how these behaviors emerge naturally, as the agent makes inferences about the observed outcomes and optimizes its generative model (via belief updating). Additionally, the discrete state-space and time formulation presented provides an accessible guide on how to derive the (variational and expected) free energy equations and belief updating rules. We conclude by noting that this formalism can be applied in other engineering applications; e.g., robotic arm movement, playing Atari games, etc., if appropriate underlying probability distributions (i.e. generative model) can be formulated.", "authors": [{"name": "Noor Sajid", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Philip J.

{"title": "Cross-Cultural Effects and Attention in Active Inference", "abstract": "— Earlier behavioural studies have shown a social and cognitive difference between European Americans and East Asian people. Westerners are thought to be more focused on object information, while the East Asians are more sensitive to context or relationship information. We focused on two neural studies and argued that this cross-cultural difference phenomenon could be explained by the attention mechanism. We applied the active inference framework to distinguish two aspects of attention, namely, the gain control and epistemic value. The former is involved in the exogenous, low-level response, and this automatic attention could account for the findings that are culturally favoured, such as change blindness and field dependence-independence distinction. The latter is involved in the endogenous, high-level responses, which is identical to the Bayesian surprise and could be measured by the P3 component. This epistemic value may account for tasks where no behavioural differences were found. Both the exogenous and endogenous value is used to minimise free energy in order to maximise the evidence of the generative model.", "authors": [{"name": "Yao Wen", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2023, "doi": "10.18178/ijpmbs.12.1.1-12", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": "21ba967b3021472312cb2ab44ac13fe20fa331c0", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "International Journal of Pharma Medicine and Biological Sciences", "citation_count": 0, "references": ["s2:46924699ccba70793ad32d281692c2a5897d9bb4", "s2:f093c343638dc8d81a2349b724e3a045a8744dfc", "s2:491fb9e49c37c133b58b7a18df4bf1041b752647", "s2:d83a4215b4024825a188a4fa80a5c909dbdb7245", "s2:012ab1cac87053d3cde88734ca0204cc3f845616", "s2:e07a66d2b115c802a2f9e1a2db3a728afec5daff", "s2:185b7f3c6fe8e647ae9c79fbb463768b64c59a52", "s2:5066e7e7bd0fd2735d6793dca8519bd024d90013", "s2:120331bd16cd69161973f9aff6799ae17be09a29", "s2:1aad3c73d8187441997bd322fea33b8ef1999509", "s2:c2a06772c538db4008ccac23da7ff3fb3039a51e", "s2:c6b98b4dbc9f00a55393c76736918d55206f7cd3", "s2:09c05f75e88dcbf417eb57c5c3771305c44b4918", "s2:01cdb3410d1aefea7fab7d02bbfc259b1984bdbf", "s2:f6b20a4c30a1319c69b6b3c9fa11783b7f9ba73d", "s2:29197a5d7c564243e491c742af190dd97aa62ec6", "s2:8e114ccd0c3f44c4933ee03c656abad40e35e43e", "s2:718062ca1648b65c6142ce1be201f96271127e2c", "s2:57620e357ee348cd5ffa8eafa480e002a2aba06a", "s2:a84d3293d487626197b5b494c55144e62662a258", "s2:935bd71a98e57c186a80e5d611abcba6f3a4d204", "s2:23f61398166030346d0f99c94a3106ae4f3ec982", "s2:8c9fe711bdd1f33645bd1104e84c25c8a51e04c2", "s2:9d91dead9612e1c6a8dd9ae3793fe697565c744e", "s2:2eea9d553cfe462c1747ed28bdaf9046d1bf794c", "s2:2ba788647916f6206f7fcc137fe7866c58e6211e", "s2:04bc5da3f1e62a68f03692182ac4fededf9d1518", "s2:c0a7be6c58321e9124734e9c1be9dc350fd03bc0", "s2:0865fafd7bf1142ceaafffa8055484d0a48007ae", "s2:3b08af33a7646a88f393f384c24d95627dfe9bfd", "s2:cb56ce41c2e4ac614ae921bf0e55d2072d90d636", "s2:1ed6a4a10589618d4f26350f1a296ee767ceff6b", "s2:6927ea92b0d759a75f0f696fa028155d6d9ee2ca", "s2:562de0b6cd487c21984c974655b326974a035031", "s2:9e92957f5f7f88e60e81fad515ccb3c23206b7f5", "s2:89e5e62432bcf9e823d77ede0695be1ced2e0d4f", "s2:2abb26a6886f1cabacd435fb6759c2afe2666fc4", "s2:ec96d2b2f33b68d90fbc3c0a7270547e0a1a5f25", "s2:bf15128e48db7aaa9146328d965fc81dbdf4db3f", "s2:f91c212d47d20c0fd4f5e0620ae9b2888644dd95", "s2:c741859fba34d1b44bedbb167e9777eaf7a05af4", "s2:31a2eef5088057ae68650dcd220f016bb15723d0", "s2:54cc1f2e86d1913521b466cef19d72ed02b6c800", "s2:aebd8bab5cff769fed204dba35112e364a47e504", "s2:086125a242e06f144ff12ec2c46430271a79fe45", "s2:b56bf734a53ad3f3ff402813d5f8c29763ab118b", "s2:2ea23db6300a9f08c95d03a25b9ae2bcc645a760", "s2:3f6149b610e3f0ba43efeefa3546f55c23656882", "s2:7fafb1fab4c164ffbbd7e99415cdd1754fe3aded", "s2:67713c50d2f20079e3e73b47d8de49b5410c83a1", "s2:2151c85569293e1c25eaf01b5f38da0717069563", "s2:6a139ed6590680594e860118c917d448bf836077", "s2:84e320dee6983b0a792adfc3b2543152d9b3edab", "s2:4b30d5aa6b874fe6e0de5e331892df4257dfd5dd", "s2:9838256e09a3ee71039e7bc3abd61eef576533fe", "s2:f7b437783907c53cdc281dae182cb305364bd71b", "s2:a6ece93a5b71d6030f7439af49188792653d5476", "s2:41e1f5e267f0f5ada527ea41e1e28067b1e20d4f", "s2:0fdd66fcf6b9bc04428e337df66fd510a659eb2f", "s2:5ac024472f943e36bac0e2b275b8d8d2cc47fe36", "s2:1be9a00b8c979be2acddd0792b3f7b4baa68db55", "s2:3eecabd0724436c0f35774ef2633d91088726b9e", "s2:9c52cccef3da81a9d1ac6d45b27c2ce6228b7e94", "s2:b25a8003a4e62d2db21560c52fb7030547834e87", "s2:dcc1e0dc5d208b6048ae03336fab86decd04bfa2", "s2:2d7e223e994c4c57c4cfd1011c474d0ceb501892", "s2:2bc549c06d601596f67d333fe62316a50fadfe7a", "s2:ebdb7c9ab022aa3bfc7fe406cd63c1a98be14fc0", "s2:7ffc9aef49573d09541db4ca8ad904f94a3418c8", "s2:9eacb448c5aa4313c362bd9725a4f146c4bd166a"], "publication_date": null}

In this article, we briefly introduce and compare the philosophical foundations underlying PCT and FEP. We then introduce and compare their experimental and mathematical foundations concretely in the context of bacterial chemotaxis. With these foundations in place, we can use tools from category theory to argue that PCT can be formally understood as a subset of the FEP framework; however, it is worth noting that the mathematical machinery unique to FEP is not required to successfully model bacterial chemotaxis.

{"title": "Visual Images Memory Recall Based on ClassRBM and Free Energy Minimization", "abstract": "Mounting evidence suggests that the brain works in a Bayesian way. Probabilistic inference models based on Bayesian theory have been widely applied in human memory modeling, such as search of associative memory (SAM) and retrieving effectively from memory (REM). However, these lines of memory models can only determine the class of the test images during memory recall. They fail to recall the test visual image, which is referred to as mental imagery in cognitive psychology. In order to address this issue, in this paper, we first propose a memory model based on classification RBM (ClassRBM), in which a three-layer neural network is constructed with 500-800-500 units. The input layer and output layer represent the visual sensory images and corresponding labels, respectively, while the hidden layer stores the encoded visual information. Then we apply free energy minimization principle to train the model, in which we assume that the storage and recall processes of memory in human brain involve free energy minimization. Finally, the learned visual images can be reconstructed by probabilistically sampling the visual units over the hidden units. Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed memory model is capable of recalling images studied and can be applied to the modeling of mental images in the mind.", "authors": [{"name": "Yiren Liu", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Yanjiang Wang", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Limiao Deng", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Mingyue Gao", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Weifeng Liu", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1109/ICSP48669.2020.9320956", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": "9533025fd1fa1dc28b30850e779f09acea4bc71b", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "International Conference on the Software Process", "citation_count": 1, "references": [], "publication_date": null}

{"title": "Effect of Protein Flexibility from Coarse-Grained Elastic Network Parameterizations on the Calculation of Free Energy Profiles of Ligand Binding.", "abstract": "The characterization of the affinity and binding mechanism of specific molecules to a protein active site is scientifically and industrially relevant for many applications. In principle, this information can be obtained using Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, by calculating the free energy profile of the process. However, this is a computationally demanding calculation. Currently, coarse grained (CG) force fields are very well implemented for MD simulations of biomolecular systems. These compu-tational efficient force fields are a major advantage to the study of large model systems and/or those requiring long simulation times. The Martini model is currently one of the most popular CG force fields for these systems. For the specific case of protein simulations, to correctly maintain the macromolecule three-dimensional structure, Martini needs to include an elastic network (EN). In this work, the effect of protein flexibility, as induced by three EN models compatible with the Martini force field, was tested on the calculation of free energy profiles for protein-ligand binding. The EN models used were ElNeDyn, GoMartini and GEN. The binding of triolein (TOG) and triacetin (TAG) to a lipase protein (thermomyces lanuginosa lipase - TLL) was used as case study. The results show that inclusion of greater flexibility in the CG parameterization of proteins is of high importance in the calculation of the free energy profiles of protein-ligand systems. However, care must be taken in order to avoid unjustified large protein deformations. In addition, due to molecular flexibility there may be no absolute need for the center of the ligand to reach the center of the protein binding site. The calculation of the energy profile to a distance of about 0.5 nm from the active site center can be sufficient to differentiate the affinity of different ligands to a protein.", "authors": [{"name": "Hugo A.

{"title": "Active Inference-Based Optimization of Discriminative Neural Network Classifiers", "abstract": "Commonly used objective functions (losses) for a supervised optimization of discriminative neural network classifiers were either distribution-based or metric-based. The distribution-based losses could compromise the generalization or cause classification biases towards the dominant classes of an imbalanced class-sample distribution. The metric-based losses could make the network model independent of any distribution and thus improve its generalization. However, they could still be biased towards the dominant classes and could suffer from discrepancies when a class was absent in both the reference (ground truth) and the predicted labels. In this paper, we proposed a novel optimization process which not only tackled the unbalancedness of the class-sample distribution of the training samples but also provided a mechanism to tackle errors in the reference labels of the training samples. This was achieved by proposing a novel algorithm to find candidate classification labels of the training samples from their prior probabilities and the currently estimated posteriors on the network and a novel objective function for the optimizations. The algorithm was the result of casting the generalized Kelly criterion for optimal betting into a multiclass classification problem. The proposed objective function was the expected free energy of a prospective active inference and could incorporate the candidate labels, the original reference labels, and the priors of the training samples while still being distribution-based. The incorporation of the priors into the optimization not only helped to tackle errors in the reference labels but also allowed to reduce classification biases towards the dominant classes by focusing the attention of the neural network on important but minority foreground classes.", "authors": [{"name": "Faezeh Fallah", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2023, "doi": "10.48550/arXiv.2306.02447", "arxiv_id": "2306.02447", "s2_id": "f3f0208fd1594cdba86202403cfa69398de00fc5", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "arXiv.org", "citation_count": 0, "references": ["s2:ea53c399e6cb48ca0c5bb5718276a10ab08fc1a6", "s2:0ff15e8473e0b5b5bb284c6e71baf7396ef70951", "s2:444e7835c3804c123f0ddc73ec72c4a5697064bd", "s2:845a23b404679361d30720d60030494b6783dbe1", "s2:7de5c9a2b9eea07697aa5b32c9810a988ce249a9", "s2:16aef42d9b453dad02a7aba750825bcb6e049bc1", "s2:9eebd3c7971a239cf69a0358563f397bd8a8f99c", "s2:b8601c86905b0184b9387b042400609febb93d10", "s2:d11c2f2ddeca06d2e775170f6972f7015924db87", "s2:a4110900768187c1b6c096401aa5febf2cf1d78f", "s2:a44cf961a4495f5a789dfa240e2675f7fffa615e", "s2:c40a37fbf0402c0e98437c9d247dcc6a9b0fb662", "s2:54036f43acc6c9b49b334270c7237217685f52fb", "s2:4926fb5e06c3552b57305e95ec44715f832c3b28", "s2:5e74edb966cd4382e9ccfd1e362aced71cfe5cd6", "s2:ae1c89817a3a239e5344293138bdd80293983460", "s2:d08b35243edc5be07387a9ed218070b31e502901", "s2:c2b7650116b653377b22b71395bf52d960682b43", "s2:79cfb51a51fc093f66aac8e858afe2e14d4a1f20", "s2:c7afd747b5c6b77dc22eaa87a8b22888243842b6", "s2:63de0ad39d807f0c256f851428f211e8d5fcd3bb", "s2:7fc464470b441c691d10e7331b14a525bc79b8bb", "s2:50004c086ffd6a201a4b782281aaa930fbfe6ecf", "s2:77f0a39b8e02686fd85b01971f8feb7f60971f80", "s2:9c9d7247f8c51ec5a02b0d911d1d7b9e8160495d", "s2:c399c0089fb134d1476fadf5f0426e0e8b70eebd", "s2:2c03df8b48bf3fa39054345bafabfeff15bfd11d", "s2:b0c065cd43aa7280e766b5dcbcc7e26abce59330", "s2:52a5a6290c0ba767ecbf3c7a665c8ac0768f37c7", "s2:f35de4f9b1a7c4d3fa96a0d2ab1bf8937671f6b6", "s2:6364fdaa0a0eccd823a779fcdd489173f938e91a", "s2:995c5f5e62614fcb4d2796ad2faab969da51713e", "s2:d6f2f611da110b5b5061731be3fc4c7f45d8ee23", "s2:a6cb366736791bcccc5c8639de5a8f9636bf87e8", "s2:3127190433230b3dc1abd0680bb58dced4bcd90e", "s2:ccfaba27ca7bce5b95dde407e9df568e5902b218", "s2:3b08af33a7646a88f393f384c24d95627dfe9bfd", "s2:ea9d2a2b4ce11aaf85136840c65f3bc9c03ab649", "s2:87cbed883368d4a9efd42fdd91f47038f8d8fbe6", "s2:32da762acabe9200ce2ffce835cbfd4c055e61fc", "s2:f0790fe1e1ac0cd2b99ec5a6583adf80f6ab5747", "s2:caddc1f0c89fdcbe69b1c0307fc8fa4f0d2608ce", "s2:43e913ee8904690c4c4e650128fb55f4919f395f", "s2:34f25a8704614163c4095b3ee2fc969b60de4698", "s2:b4821d2dee04f27e55112090c9029da30cc8b291"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "From External Interaction to Internal Inference: An Intelligent Learning Framework for Spectrum Sharing and UAV Trajectory Optimization", "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication is of crucial importance in realizing heterogeneous practical wireless application scenarios. However, it is susceptible to the severe spectrum scarcity and interference issues since it operates in the unlicensed frequency band. To tackle those issues, a dynamic spectrum sharing UAV network adopting an anti-jamming technique is considered. Two intelligent spectrum allocation and trajectory optimization schemes are designed, capitalizing on the proposed external interaction and internal inference based frameworks. For the first scheme, a novel external interaction based hybrid online-offline multi-agent actor-critic and deep deterministic policy gradient (MA2C-DDPG) framework is proposed taking into account the hybrid characteristics of discrete spectrum allocation and continuous UAV trajectory. As for the second scheme, another novel framework, the deep active inference (DAI) based on internal inference is proposed, which minimizes the internal variational free energy. Moreover, a belief learning based method is exploited to enhance the agents’ perception and improve the action selection in the dynamic spectrum sharing environment. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the high efficiency of our proposed schemes. It is shown that our proposed schemes significantly improve the secondary network sum transmission rate compared to various benchmark schemes. Moreover, the proposed MA2C-DDPG and DAI frameworks demonstrate the advantages in improving the training stability and convergence speed.", "authors": [{"name": "Rui Ding", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Fuhui Zhou", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Qihui Wu", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Derrick Wing Kwan Ng", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2024, "doi": "10.1109/TWC.2024.3387980", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": "63f9579cf82db99bde662d851d881ca921b9be15", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications", "citation_count": 15, "references": [], "publication_date": null}

{"title": "Therapeutic Alliance as Active Inference: The Role of Therapeutic Touch and Biobehavioural Synchrony in Musculoskeletal Care", "abstract": "Touch is recognised as crucial for survival, fostering cooperative communication, accelerating recovery, reducing hospital stays, and promoting overall wellness and the therapeutic alliance. In this hypothesis and theory paper, we present an entwined model that combines touch for alignment and active inference to explain how the brain develops “priors” necessary for the health care provider to engage with the patient effectively. We appeal to active inference to explain the empirically integrative neurophysiological and behavioural mechanisms that underwrite synchronous relationships through touch. Specifically, we offer a formal framework for understanding – and explaining – the role of therapeutic touch and hands-on care in developing a therapeutic alliance and synchrony between health care providers and their patients in musculoskeletal care. We first review the crucial importance of therapeutic touch and its clinical role in facilitating the formation of a solid therapeutic alliance and in regulating allostasis. We then consider how touch is used clinically – to promote cooperative communication, demonstrate empathy, overcome uncertainty, and infer the mental states of others – through the lens of active inference. We conclude that touch plays a crucial role in achieving successful clinical outcomes and adapting previous priors to create intertwined beliefs. The ensuing framework may help healthcare providers in the field of musculoskeletal care to use hands-on care to strengthen the therapeutic alliance, minimise prediction errors (a.k.a., free energy), and thereby promote recovery from physical and psychological impairments.", "authors": [{"name": "Zoe McParlin", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "F.

{"title": "Free energy methods for Bayesian inference: efficient exploration of univariate Gaussian mixture posteriors", "abstract": "Because of their multimodality, mixture posterior distributions are difficult to sample with standard Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. We propose a strategy to enhance the sampling of MCMC in this context, using a biasing procedure which originates from computational Statistical Physics. The principle is first to choose a “reaction coordinate”, that is, a “direction” in which the target distribution is multimodal. In a second step, the marginal log-density of the reaction coordinate with respect to the posterior distribution is estimated; minus this quantity is called “free energy” in the computational Statistical Physics literature. To this end, we use adaptive biasing Markov chain algorithms which adapt their targeted invariant distribution on the fly, in order to overcome sampling barriers along the chosen reaction coordinate. Finally, we perform an importance sampling step in order to remove the bias and recover the true posterior. The efficiency factor of the importance sampling step can easily be estimated a priori once the bias is known, and appears to be rather large for the test cases we considered. A crucial point is the choice of the reaction coordinate. One standard choice (used for example in the classical Wang-Landau algorithm) is minus the log-posterior density. We discuss other choices. We show in particular that the hyper-parameter that determines the order of magnitude of the variance of each component is both a convenient and an efficient reaction coordinate. We also show how to adapt the method to compute the evidence (marginal likelihood) of a mixture model. We illustrate our approach by analyzing two real data sets.", "authors": [{"name": "N.

{"title": "A computational neuroscience perspective on subjective wellbeing within the active inference framework", "abstract": "Understanding and promoting subjective wellbeing (SWB) has been the topic of increasing research, due in part to its potential contributions to health and productivity. To date, the conceptualization of SWB has been grounded within social psychology and largely focused on self-report measures. In this paper, we explore the potentially complementary tools and theoretical perspectives offered by computational neuroscience, with a focus on the active inference (AI) framework. This framework is motivated by the fact that the brain does not have direct access to the world; to select actions, it must instead infer the most likely external causes of the sensory input it receives from both the body and the external world. Because sensory input is always consistent with multiple interpretations, the brain’s internal model must use background knowledge, in the form of prior expectations, to make a “best guess” about the situation it is in and how it will change by taking one action or another. This best guess arises by minimizing an error signal representing the deviation between predicted and observed sensations given a chosen action—quantified mathematically by a variable called free energy (FE). Crucially, recent proposals have illustrated how emotional experience may emerge within AI as a natural consequence of the brain keeping track of the success of its model in selecting actions to minimize FE. In this paper, we draw on the concepts and mathematics in AI to highlight how different computational strategies can be used to minimize FE—some more successfully than others. This affords a characterization of how diverse individuals may adopt unique strategies for achieving high SWB. It also highlights novel ways in which SWB could be effectively improved. These considerations lead us to propose a novel computational framework for understanding SWB. We highlight several parameters in these models that could explain individual and cultural differences in SWB, and how they might inspire novel interventions. We conclude by proposing a line of future empirical research based on computational modelling that could complement current approaches to the study of wellbeing and its improvement.", "authors": [{"name": "Ryan Smith", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "L.

{"title": "Conceptual Modelling of Brain State Dynamics as Free Energy and Entropy-Based Processes", "abstract": "Despite the mass of empirical data in neuroscience and plenty of interdisciplinary approaches in cognitive science, there are relatively few applicable theories of how the brain as a coherent system functions in terms of energy and entropy processes. Recently, a free energy principle has been portrayed as a possible way towards a unified brain theory. However, its capacity, using free energy and entropy, to unify different perspectives on brain function dynamics is yet to be established. This multidisciplinary study attempts to make sense of the free energy and entropy not only from the perspective of Helmholtz thermodynamic basic principles but also from the information theory framework. Based on the proposed conceptual framework, we constructed (i) four basic brain states (deep sleep, resting, active wakeful and thinking) as dynamic entropy and free energy processes and (ii) stylized a self-organizing mechanism of transitions between the basic brain states during a day period. Adaptive transitions between brain states represent homeostatic rhythms, which produce complex daily brain states dynamics. As a result, the proposed simulation model produces different self-organized circadian dynamics of brain states for different types of chronotypes, which corresponds with the empirical observations.", "authors": [{"name": "D.

This enables Friston's account to encompass a unified treatment—a complexity theory—of the role of virtual reality in both dreaming and mental disorder. In both accounts the brain operates to minimize FE aroused by sensory impingements—including interoceptive impingements that report compliance with biological imperatives—and constructs a representation/model of the causes of impingement that enables this minimization. In Friston's account (variational) FE equals complexity minus accuracy, and is minimized by increasing accuracy and decreasing complexity. Roughly the brain (or model) increases accuracy together with complexity in waking. This is mediated by consciousness-creating active inference—by which it explains sensory impingements in terms of perceptual experiences of their causes. In sleep it reduces complexity by processes that include both synaptic pruning and consciousness/virtual reality/dreaming in REM. The consciousness-creating active inference that effects complexity-reduction in REM dreaming must operate on FE-arousing data distinct from sensory impingement. The most relevant source is remembered arousals of emotion, both recent and remote, as processed in SWS and REM on “active systems” accounts of memory consolidation/reconsolidation. Freud describes these remembered arousals as condensed in the dreamwork for use in the conscious contents of dreams, and similar condensation can be seen in symptoms. Complexity partly reflects emotional conflict and trauma. This indicates that dreams and symptoms are both produced to reduce complexity in the form of potentially adverse (traumatic or conflicting) arousals of amygdala-related emotions. Mental disorder is thus caused by computational complexity together with mechanisms like synaptic pruning that have evolved for complexity-reduction; and important features of disorder can be understood in these terms. Details of the consilience among Freudian, systems consolidation, and complexity-reduction accounts appear clearly in the analysis of a single fragment of a dream, indicating also how complexity reduction proceeds by a process resembling Bayesian model selection.", "authors": [{"name": "J.

{"title": "An Active Inference view of cognitive control", "abstract": "A commentary on \n \nWhat ever next? Predictive brains, situated agents, and the future of cognitive science \n \nby Clark, A. (in press). Behav. Brain Sci. \n \nThe Active Inference framework (Friston et al., 2009; Friston, 2010) argues that the brain's generative models continuously produce predictions and goals that guide its action (active inference) and perception (predictive coding) through free energy minimization. In this framework, most studies have focused on the on-line prediction of perceptual events and the control of overt behavior. We propose that the framework can be extended to explain cognitive control. \n \nWe assume that architectures of cognitive control are elaborations of the predictive architectures of sensorimotor behavior in early living organisms. As the sensorimotor control system of early organisms evolved (to face increasingly harder individual and social problems), it gradually began predicting increasingly long-term and abstract consequence of behavior and—critically—doing so off-line and without overt behavior. This permitted rehearsing action sequences without executing them. In turn, off-line predictions opened the doors to higher cognitive abilities, such as planning, emulation, imagery, mental state inference, goal-directed decision-making, prospection, and the acquisition of declarative knowledge (Hesslow, 2002; Grush, 2004; Jeannerod, 2006; Pezzulo and Castelfranchi, 2007, 2009; Moulton and Kosslyn, 2009; Pezzulo, 2011; Clark, in press). \n \nWe argue that off-line predictions opened the doors to executive functions and cognitive control, too. Executive functions, typically linked to prefrontal cortex, are self-directed actions functional to self-regulation and the coordinated planning of present and future actions and goals toward distal objectives. Executive functions (and prefrontal cortex functioning) have been linked to a plethora of processes, including the self-generation of goals and plans, their maintenance in working memory, their monitoring, the inhibition of prepotent but inappropriate actions, the regulation of attention, and valuation processes. A reconciling perspective is that prefrontal cortex supports “cognitive control”: the control of thought processes and the top–down guidance of overt behavior toward distal goals (Fuster, 1997; Miller and Cohen, 2001; Botvinick, 2008). \n \nWe cast cognitive control within the Active Inference framework. We argue that cognitive control consists in a nesting of optimizations (i.e., free energy minimization loops) over time; in addition to the usual overt loop of active inference, one (or more) covert loop(s) help optimizing distal goals. The left part of Figure ​Figure11 shows the Active Inference framework, in which predictions and goals steer perception and action via free energy minimization. Note that here predictions are relative to the present situation. The right part of Figure ​Figure11 shows an extension of the framework that includes Controlled Predictions and a nesting of optimizations (for simplicity we only show two loops). \n \n \n \nFigure 1 \n \nLeft: Active Inference framework. Right: “Controlled Predictions” and cognitive control. \n \n \n \nThe covert loop works off-line via the suppression of overt sensory and motor processes (in the Active Inference framework, this requires the suppression of proprioception). This permits running imaginary actions that produce a sequence of fictive actions and of predictions relative to future (rather than present) situations. Fictive actions and predictions can be optimized via free energy minimization but without overt execution: they are not just “mind wandering” but are truly controlled toward goals specified at higher hierarchical levels. Prospection and planning are thus optimization processes that support the generation of distal and abstract goals (and associated plans), beyond current affordances. The covert loop supports also the recall of learned contextual goals and rules rather than always forming them de novo via active inference. \n \nThe selected goals can thus be set as priors for the overt loop. In the Active Inference framework, this has the same effect as goal maintenance in working memory, and affords the top–down guidance of overt behavior beyond stereotyped responses, which is the hallmark of cognitive control. [Note that specifying contextual rules or plans to distal goals requires setting strong priors over sets of states and transitions rather than just one set point (Friston et al., 2012)]. \n \nActive inference in the overt loop ensures that the goals (and plans) generated by the covert loop are achieved in practice. In turn, feedback from the overt loop is informative of (changing) environmental constraints; it permits revising and re-situating imagined goals, and ultimately achieving them in the current context. In some cases, the overt loop is recruited for planning and thinking, too, such as for instance when Tetris players rotate blocks to better decide where to place them (Kirsh and Maglio, 1994). \n \nOur view is compatible with theories of cognitive control that highlight the active maintenance of goals in working memory (Miller and Cohen, 2001). However, we assume that cognitive control and mental operations are internalized forms of overt actions and recruit the same brain structures, rather than involving separated neural representations and dedicated, modular processing (Diamond, 2000; Barkley, 2001; Cotterill, 2001; Ito, 2008; Pezzulo, 2011). \n \nWe propose that the nesting of optimization processes is mainly realized in prefrontal hierarchies and is functional to the achievement of goals at different time scales. Compared to overt action, cognitive control optimizes at longer time scales, and requires maintaining goal representation (priors) for a long time. It is thus not surprising that cognitive control processes (and in our proposal, covert loops) mainly involve high hierarchical levels. This creates a potential confound, suggesting that cognitive control might also require dedicated neural resources or modularized processing. However, our proposed architecture can be implemented within a homogeneous (cortical) hierarchy performing free energy minimization; which ones of the hierarchical levels are recruited to work covertly depends on task demands (say, abstract thought vs. the mental imagery of rotating an object with the left hand). \n \nOur view suggests that executive functions and forethought might have resulted from an internalization of the process of predicting the consequences of actions, which permitted to endogenously steer and control covert predictive loops. Partial support for this view comes from the close relationships between the neural systems for motor preparation and mental imagery (Cisek and Kalaska, 2010). Furthermore, in our proposal cognitive control requires the coordination of overt and covert processes. Disruption of this process might result in the execution of imagined actions, as it was reported by Schwoebel et al. (2002) in the case of a patient with bilateral parietal lesions who was unable to refrain from executing imagined (hand) movements.", "authors": [{"name": "G.

{"title": "Communication as Socially Extended Active Inference: An Ecological Approach to Communicative Behavior", "abstract": "Abstract In this paper, we introduce an ecological account of communication according to which acts of communication are active inferences achieved by affecting the behavior of a target organism via the modification of its field of affordances. Constraining a target organism’s behavior constitutes a mechanism of socially extended active inference, allowing organisms to proactively regulate their inner states through the behavior of other organisms. In this general conception of communication, the type of cooperative communication characteristic of human communicative interaction is a way of constraining interaction dynamics toward the goals of a given joint action by constructing and altering shared fields of affordances. This account embraces a pragmatist view according to which communication is a form of action aiming to influence the behavior of a target, and stands against the traditional transmission view according to which communication fundamentally serves to convey information. Understanding acts of communication as active inference under an ecological interpretation allows us to link communicative and ultimately linguistic behavior to the biological imperative of minimizing free energy and to emphasize the action-oriented nature of communicative interaction.", "authors": [{"name": "Remi Tison", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Pierre Poirier", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2021, "doi": "10.1080/10407413.2021.1965480", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": "c9551658d9ac2aecbacb1214709942afaa4222e0", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "Ecological psychology", "citation_count": 18, "references": [], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Robot self/other distinction: active inference meets neural networks learning in a mirror", "abstract": "Self/other distinction and self-recognition are important skills for interacting with the world, as it allows humans to differentiate own actions from others and be self-aware. However, only a selected group of animals, mainly high order mammals such as humans, has passed the mirror test, a behavioural experiment proposed to assess self-recognition abilities. In this paper, we describe self-recognition as a process that is built on top of body perception unconscious mechanisms. We present an algorithm that enables a robot to perform non-appearance self-recognition on a mirror and distinguish its simple actions from other entities, by answering the following question: am I generating these sensations? The algorithm combines active inference, a theoretical model of perception and action in the brain, with neural network learning. The robot learns the relation between its actions and its body with the effect produced in the visual field and its body sensors. The prediction error generated between the models and the real observations during the interaction is used to infer the body configuration through free energy minimization and to accumulate evidence for recognizing its body. Experimental results on a humanoid robot show the reliability of the algorithm for different initial conditions, such as mirror recognition in any perspective, robot-robot distinction and human-robot differentiation.", "authors": [{"name": "Pablo Lanillos", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "J.

{"title": "Active Wetting: Statics and Dynamics", "abstract": "Active wetting extends classical wetting physics to living systems, in which cells and tissues spread by generating internal forces rather than relying solely on passive interfacial tensions. Unlike passive systems, which evolve toward thermodynamic and mechanical equilibrium by minimizing free energy, active systems remain far from equilibrium due to continuous energy input and dissipation. Their dynamics are sustained, adaptive, and responsive to chemical and mechanical cues in ways that depart fundamentally from passive behavior. In addition, active systems lack a unified energetic or variational principle to describe their evolution. What insights can be drawn from passive models, and how these models might be generalized to account for activity, remain open questions. Studying active wetting may thus reveal new principles of nonequilibrium dynamics at soft and living interfaces, and offer deeper understanding of key biological processes such as wound healing, cancer invasion, and biofilm growth.", "authors": [{"name": "Amir Pahlavan", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "M.

The particles can be very small organisms such as rod-shaped pathogenic bacteria that have the capacity to cause diseases in humans or artificially made active particles such as Janus colloids. In this article, we investigate the wrapping dynamics of an ellipsoidal self-propelled particle by a giant unilamellar vesicle (GUV). Within the Canham-Helfrich theory of membranes, the free energy of wrapping is derived. We found that the system exhibits a first-order transition from partially to completely wrapped states due to the active force generated by the particle. In addition, increasing the particle size and the adhesive energy, or decreasing the membranes's spontaneous curvature, can reduce the energy barrier. The kinetics of wrapping is studied in the framework of Onsager's variational principle. For small particles, the wrapping time is found to be minimum for the membranes with negative spontaneous curvature. Also, our phase diagrams suggest that the wrapping time can be reduced by increasing the active force for small particles, but this effect is hardly seen for large particles.", "authors": [{"name": "Kittiwat Tangmongkollert", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "M.

{"title": "Adversarial inference: predictive minds in the attention economy", "abstract": "Abstract What is it about our current digital technologies that seemingly makes it difficult for users to attend to what matters to them? According to the dominant narrative in the literature on the “attention economy,” a user’s lack of attention is due to the large amounts of information available in their everyday environments. I will argue that information-abundance fails to account for some of the central manifestations of distraction, such as sudden urges to check a particular information-source in the absence of perceptual information. I will use active inference, and in particular models of action selection based on the minimization of expected free energy, to develop an alternative answer to the question about what makes it difficult to attend. Besides obvious adversarial forms of inference, in which algorithms build up models of users in order to keep them scrolling, I will show that active inference provides the tools to identify a number of problematic structural features of current digital technologies: they contain limitless sources of novelty, they can be navigated by very simple and effortless motor movements, and they offer their action possibilities everywhere and anytime independent of place or context. Moreover, recent models of motivated control show an intricate interplay between motivation and control that can explain sudden transitions in motivational state and the consequent alteration of the salience of actions. I conclude, therefore, that the challenges users encounter when engaging with digital technologies are less about information overload or inviting content, but more about the continuous availability of easily available possibilities for action.", "authors": [{"name": "J.

{"title": "A Minimum Free Energy Model of Motor Learning", "abstract": "Even highly trained behaviors demonstrate variability, which is correlated with performance on current and future tasks. An objective of motor learning that is general enough to explain these phenomena has not been precisely formulated. In this six-week longitudinal learning study, participants practiced a set of motor sequences each day, and neuroimaging data were collected on days 1, 14, 28, and 42 to capture the neural correlates of the learning process. In our analysis, we first modeled the underlying neural and behavioral dynamics during learning. Our results demonstrate that the densities of whole-brain response, task-active regional response, and behavioral performance evolve according to a Fokker-Planck equation during the acquisition of a motor skill. We show that this implies that the brain concurrently optimizes the entropy of a joint density over neural response and behavior (as measured by sampling over multiple trials and subjects) and the expected performance under this density; we call this formulation of learning minimum free energy learning (MFEL). This model provides an explanation as to how behavioral variability can be tuned while simultaneously improving performance during learning. We then develop a novel variant of inverse reinforcement learning to retrieve the cost function optimized by the brain during the learning process, as well as the parameter used to tune variability. We show that this population-level analysis can be used to derive a learning objective that each subject optimizes during his or her study. In this way, MFEL effectively acts as a unifying principle, allowing users to precisely formulate learning objectives and infer their structure.", "authors": [{"name": "B.

{"title": "World model learning and inference", "abstract": "Understanding information processing in the brain-and creating general-purpose artificial intelligence-are long-standing aspirations of scientists and engineers worldwide. The distinctive features of human intelligence are high-level cognition and control in various interactions with the world including the self, which are not defined in advance and are vary over time. The challenge of building human-like intelligent machines, as well as progress in brain science and behavioural analyses, robotics, and their associated theoretical formalisations, speaks to the importance of the world-model learning and inference. In this article, after briefly surveying the history and challenges of internal model learning and probabilistic learning, we introduce the free energy principle, which provides a useful framework within which to consider neuronal computation and probabilistic world models. Next, we showcase examples of human behaviour and cognition explained under that principle. We then describe symbol emergence in the context of probabilistic modelling, as a topic at the frontiers of cognitive robotics. Lastly, we review recent progress in creating human-like intelligence by using novel probabilistic programming languages. The striking consensus that emerges from these studies is that probabilistic descriptions of learning and inference are powerful and effective ways to create human-like artificial intelligent machines and to understand intelligence in the context of how humans interact with their world.", "authors": [{"name": "K.

{"title": "Sequence determinants of protein phase separation and recognition by protein phase-separated condensates through molecular dynamics and active learning.", "abstract": "Elucidating how protein sequence determines the properties of disordered proteins and their phase-separated condensates is a great challenge in computational chemistry, biology, and biophysics. Quantitative molecular dynamics simulations and derived free energy values can in principle capture how a sequence encodes the chemical and biological properties of a protein. These calculations are, however, computationally demanding, even after reducing the representation by coarse-graining; exploring the large spaces of potentially relevant sequences remains a formidable task. We employ an \"active learning\" scheme introduced by Yang et al. (bioRxiv, 2022, https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.08.05.502972) to reduce the number of labelled examples needed from simulations, where a neural network-based model suggests the most useful examples for the next training cycle. Applying this Bayesian optimisation framework, we determine properties of protein sequences with coarse-grained molecular dynamics, which enables the network to establish sequence-property relationships for disordered proteins and their self-interactions and their interactions in phase-separated condensates. We show how iterative training with second virial coefficients derived from the simulations of disordered protein sequences leads to a rapid improvement in predicting peptide self-interactions. We employ this Bayesian approach to efficiently search for new sequences that bind to condensates of the disordered C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA Polymerase II, by simulating molecular recognition of peptides to phase-separated condensates in coarse-grained molecular dynamics.

{"title": "Free Energy, Precision and Learning: The Role of Cholinergic Neuromodulation", "abstract": "Acetylcholine (ACh) is a neuromodulatory transmitter implicated in perception and learning under uncertainty. This study combined computational simulations and pharmaco-electroencephalography in humans, to test a formulation of perceptual inference based upon the free energy principle. This formulation suggests that ACh enhances the precision of bottom-up synaptic transmission in cortical hierarchies by optimizing the gain of supragranular pyramidal cells. Simulations of a mismatch negativity paradigm predicted a rapid trial-by-trial suppression of evoked sensory prediction error (PE) responses that is attenuated by cholinergic neuromodulation. We confirmed this prediction empirically with a placebo-controlled study of cholinesterase inhibition. Furthermore, using dynamic causal modeling, we found that drug-induced differences in PE responses could be explained by gain modulation in supragranular pyramidal cells in primary sensory cortex. This suggests that ACh adaptively enhances sensory precision by boosting bottom-up signaling when stimuli are predictable, enabling the brain to respond optimally under different levels of environmental uncertainty.", "authors": [{"name": "R.

{"title": "The non-equilibrium thermodynamics of active suspensions", "abstract": "Active suspensions composed of self-propelled colloidal particles are considered. The propulsion of these micrometric particles is generated by chemical reactions occurring by heterogeneous catalysis at their surface and by diffusiophoresis coupling the concentration gradients of the reacting molecular species to the fluid velocity. By this mechanism, chemical free energy is transduced into mechanical motion. The non-equilibrium thermodynamics of such active suspensions is developed by explicitly taking into account the internal degrees of freedom of the active particles, which are the Eulerian angles specifying their orientation. Accordingly, the distribution function of the colloidal particles is defined in the six-dimensional configuration space of their position and their orientation, which fully characterises the polar, nematic, and higher orientational orders in the active system. The local Gibbs and Euler thermodynamic relations are expressed in terms of the colloidal distribution function, the dynamics of which is ruled by a six-dimensional local conservation equation. All the processes contributing to the entropy production rate are derived from the local conservation and kinetic equations for the colloids, the molecular species, mass, linear momentum, and energy, identifying their thermodynamic forces—also called affinities—and their dissipative current densities. The non-equilibrium constitutive relations between them are obtained using the Curie symmetry principle and the Onsager–Casimir reciprocal relations based on microreversibility. In this way, all the coefficients of mechanochemical coupling are completely determined for isothermal, incompressible, dilute suspensions composed of spherical Janus particles on the basis of the interfacial properties between the fluid solution and the solid particles and chemohydrodynamics. The complete expression of the entropy production rate is thus established for such active systems.", "authors": [{"name": "Pierre Gaspard", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2025, "doi": "10.1088/1367-2630/adf660", "arxiv_id": "2505.21009", "s2_id": "a5eea48a0bf2a4a818d935b1f76e618dcd7850b4", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "New Journal of Physics", "citation_count": 2, "references": ["s2:44a239e56e07be8f8c6226525ef7f04bf06382fa", "s2:039e2ae3567cb40f6f74734ddd20c96612280d2d", "s2:395df0d054ae131e840f8126cee4ee5581e1eb87", "s2:abb18622f99ef5a818dd34101d76ad7400825b15", "s2:9395ceadb2457be5e3a725f336543cfc40961718", "s2:ce75360779ebc88a9a41e168bed498abf307c3b6", "s2:ab42798eba327e7149269ff798f4fb91eb5a6688", "s2:0ce48aa0dbf822cd8cf1b52a29021202050d49b9", "s2:3c2e93029b9299ca0f1827ea226488a99fa04856", "s2:df0ad4ced8fb0917a8459e8d4fed93dadee25a23", "s2:8005ce41378874813c8dc5adbae5e2ed08a483f5", "s2:22d18aa171c289e69fc7af6dc67faf6f0b311ed6", "s2:09232b9e2147f5cf9a880b2c52128f319715c5b2", "s2:163e706c6b97bd3de7d4ba56316103cd4a32ef2b", "s2:0cd555c8a15ca06a78d3ba2dc9e7029a03d9f2b3", "s2:4e58373a9c10b0b7982759f2b71eaa3848f7bcb2", "s2:17addf023f48027c058abc26653b3a383a9d5b19", "s2:7ea1cd2ddda3dfadf35e7b320a80340929e273ae", "s2:9cd4d3442c33c13862b1f7c0522c6022fc16b93e", "s2:a8f9f190531d64df91cb055f03b9b7040c799244", "s2:9384f52e21d5808b5325b8510aebd8912938ceb1", "s2:235314e2e8953d12d5495b178d01f6cbfc3593b8", "s2:03b3428659a78ed9243c1d56a665fb7b11b9edb0", "s2:17872a0da3f23c26ec6c132d51727d842129c1ee", "s2:c8ad68d97c5d5c592210343b025826388f29338d", "s2:423cfbabb1e37610a3db01300cbf3a69886cab26", "s2:df493fe02c066da928f2e7ae5175ceb40e8a91b6", "s2:a001efe09b1e1927b77b1c9bbc846a0cc9642bdb", "s2:f9ad561361356a193107d5d4acfdb3651147cba5", "s2:b01f330edc15b67c97d73d3e1010eb9a553ce722", "s2:dba6e329a0d29fdee0fc51343c56865931ae3288", "s2:25a70f915c2a5eebcb0104abc4042935278a2392", "s2:ea0b232ed0f3b70427ee94a15929e293b7199d38", "s2:a0c32e3172b7dc3e4857be8a4b0bb242ff84b1da", "s2:e4fd390b19b2b7c30cf09af0657c051527cc1dbb", "s2:bbf4bfd74aa529f9211f74b8c78ffe24c5ccd41c", "s2:931a6f5dafc7fef6e0c009cfde2e8f25f510d6b0", "s2:52d85cbd242068184208ea58ad19ebf26a7cb9c0", "s2:ef9f36e008b2d02cdf0c99b39a74d509d1e6cf6a", "s2:68690505da43aa2acb5842a33faf8fc0f7e41e63", "s2:ed04e9a770eb3cc2df704ac3605060579144753c", "s2:6206fcb6eb846cc935e5ec4a5d1016a584fc7b0d", "s2:ad7a0de8fc44042df18c1a4f1cd54b9e27527151", "s2:0642ce5dfb72e6085056938dccc57736255e8054", "s2:82eecda80dd752e4dc77f945bf156734c3dcf651", "s2:3aefb5329544a4b08d5d6ca20d03ec3d32d65392", "s2:b74d33d7f51c04a6585802c807b0c80c16b94f1d", "s2:49554831406a54d899b42d31b1b6b0fc99ebfb06", "s2:2c9d8728b6b05c0ddb879379243cc8419efcd98e", "s2:8f3b87be44a8a83984a01bcebe0dd91d222627cc", "s2:92c27a47c52bdda171ab7d85f8532a209b27ec37", "s2:07e731a4eb81c00a39ced7caf03f8836eb393355", "s2:579360954b088c78dce1c61f68f54e4e2f699be6", "s2:1b97aa337619c741dabdf7788c82f1bf57a70d3f", "s2:42bbd1196cfb0efa5f5c5cd84d803863c93953d4", "s2:cd7bdcd983efd0770ff698064ed18e0fb95415c6", "s2:1b921e165bda61dc3892897f017a2aa1d0ab5d21", "s2:1920104014bd09cf94b4f7755761aa52e2fbefb2", "s2:89a1993c14b7296e113850d096d7fd9bf7fef6a7", "s2:d27683a4f15528752616fb4a06058028f5bfd9e6", "s2:2e9c04cd6b429141975dd88b9b80c60e9afff451", "s2:40391ba85c526d923e279ddd0c6df6e36d836d64", "s2:07011d21260843dc6495650d1c2dadd0805f444f", "s2:22e8c7c2bc55e791769d77b78101deeec2a0978d", "s2:9aa87ac3947fc59e58eb3eef2fad1b27709a74cc", "s2:06572ab057d63fe3b05e695e076ca1b75a49a3e5", "s2:9f1e7910a3fc0dbc7536a61b38d089ae34022fbd", "s2:42a2242f757f577266612002b78a34218397b4a1", "s2:e1cb061c8562a41c53432e7f2ccea88d96c97ca1", "s2:631a240ff8eb333647a3659e380150d5f58f5c86", "s2:8f20a6983aa6b62f3c8fd9af8988d295c63e0045", "s2:cbb64fc264fce9a48459fcd680c5c9157e8e4706", "s2:ec8981e9321ee38dec9db8d11f910ab54e4543dc", "s2:12303f9b928453d45134ae3ad096969b8fd527ab", "s2:c8fd13498098c042dba0360104208bdedd8c310c"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Liquid spherical shells are a non-equilibrium steady state of active droplets", "abstract": "Liquid-liquid phase separation yields spherical droplets that eventually coarsen to one large, stable droplet governed by the principle of minimal free energy. In chemically fueled phase separation, the formation of phase-separating molecules is coupled to a fuel-driven, non-equilibrium reaction cycle. It thus yields dissipative structures sustained by a continuous fuel conversion. Such dissipative structures are ubiquitous in biology but are poorly understood as they are governed by non-equilibrium thermodynamics. Here, we bridge the gap between passive, close-to-equilibrium, and active, dissipative structures with chemically fueled phase separation. We observe that spherical, active droplets can undergo a morphological transition into a liquid, spherical shell. We demonstrate that the mechanism is related to gradients of short-lived droplet material. We characterize how far out of equilibrium the spherical shell state is and the chemical power necessary to sustain it. Our work suggests alternative avenues for assembling complex stable morphologies, which might already be exploited to form membraneless organelles by cells.", "authors": [{"name": "Alexander M.

{"title": "Active liquid-liquid phase separation in a confining environment.", "abstract": "Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in a confining environment is believed to play an important role in cell biology. At least in some cases, this form of LLPS involves free energy consumption, which could lead to breakdown of the fundamental Principle of Detailed Balance (PDB). Recently, it was shown that when active noise at the microscopic level is included in the classical theory of nucleation and growth this does not cause the breakdown of detailed balance at the macroscopic level provided that the droplet radius is the only collective coordinate. Here we present a simple model for active LLPS in a confining environment with the droplet location in a confining potential functioning as a second collective coordinate. Using the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem as a diagnostic, we show that the PDB now is broken at the macroscopic level but in an unusual fashion: the active noise suppresses both the linear susceptibility and the quasicritical thermal noise spectrum in an asymmetric manner.", "authors": [{"name": "Chen Lin", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "R.

{"title": "Bio-inspired feedback-circuit implementation of discrete, free energy optimizing, winner-take-all computations", "abstract": "Bayesian inference and bounded rational decision-making require the accumulation of evidence or utility, respectively, to transform a prior belief or strategy into a posterior probability distribution over hypotheses or actions. Crucially, this process cannot be simply realized by independent integrators, since the different hypotheses and actions also compete with each other. In continuous time, this competitive integration process can be described by a special case of the replicator equation. Here we investigate simple analog electric circuits that implement the underlying differential equation under the constraint that we only permit a limited set of building blocks that we regard as biologically interpretable, such as capacitors, resistors, voltage-dependent conductances and voltage- or current-controlled current and voltage sources. The appeal of these circuits is that they intrinsically perform normalization without requiring an explicit divisive normalization. However, even in idealized simulations, we find that these circuits are very sensitive to internal noise as they accumulate error over time. We discuss in how far neural circuits could implement these operations that might provide a generic competitive principle underlying both perception and action.", "authors": [{"name": "Tim Genewein", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Daniel A.

{"title": "Dynamic Model and Node Selection for Collaborative Inference of Large/Small Models in Vehicular Networks", "abstract": "Collaborative inference between large cloud-hosted models and small edge-deployed models offers a promising solution for balancing the accuracy and efficiency of ML-based applications in vehicular networks. Selecting the appropriate models and their hosting nodes for performing various inference tasks plays a crucial role in collaborative inference in vehicular networks. However, existing solutions, primarily based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), suffer critical limitations, including delayed and suboptimal decisions on model and node selection in dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamic model and node selection strategy for a collaborative inference framework, grounded in active inference theory. Our strategy dynamically aligns task requirements with model capabilities and node capacities by considering factors such as vehicular mobility, latency constraints, task complexity, and model accuracy. Additionally, when significant drops in inference accuracy are detected, we fine-tune and update the models deployed on both the edge and cloud, ensuring reliable and up-to-date inference. By leveraging active inference to minimize free energy through Bayesian belief updates, our framework reduces average latency by 23.2%, lowers task failure rates by 67%, and achieves superior load balancing compared to existing methods. It also demonstrates robust dynamic performance with a 5.1% failure rate under 200% traffic surges, and its hybrid update strategy maintains 85.4% accuracy after 72 hours, effectively addressing the complex and dynamic conditions of vehicular networks.", "authors": [{"name": "Mengke Zheng", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Zhihui Lu", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Qiang Duan", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Baoqi Huang", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Shijing Hu", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2025, "doi": "10.1109/ICWS67624.2025.00037", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": "d8504ea771d12106dac7605ac82b5d46cea93d22", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "2025 IEEE International Conference on Web Services (ICWS)", "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Consciousness, Free Energy and Cognitive Algorithms", "abstract": "Different theoretical approaches have tried to model consciousness and subjective experience, from phenomenology (Husserl, 1913), cognitive psychology and neuroscience (Baars, 2005; Dehaene, 2014), artificial intelligence and cybernetics (Baars and Franklin, 2009; Rudrauf and Debban, 2018), statistical physics and probabilistic models (Solms and Friston, 2018) to mathematics of relationships (Ehresmann and Vanbremeersch, 2009). In this regard, even if the neurobiological functioning of the brain is different from the symbolic processing of a computer (Varela et al., 1991), it might be relevant to conceptualize psychological activity as a Turing machine. For example, Dehaene (2014) assumes that this type of machine offers “a fairly reasonable model of the operations that our brain is capable of performing under the control of consciousness” (p. 151) and points out that “the conscious brain (...) functions like a human Turing machine that allows us to mentally execute any algorithm1. Its calculations are very slow, because each intermediate result must be stored in working memory before being sent to the next step—but its computing power is impressive” (p. 150). From this point of view, we would like to suggest in this paper how we could rely on fundamental tools used in computer sciences such as computability theory, algorithmic and finite automata (Pin, 2006; Wolper, 2006) in order to improve our understanding of consciousness. Among current theories of consciousness, one of the most promising has been developed during the last 10 years by Karl Friston (2009) which states that the brain constructs a predictive representation of its environment that infers the probable causes of sensory stimuli. This representation, or simulation, would lead, or could even be equal, to consciousness (Solms, 2013). This predictive model cannot be right all the time and sometimes there must be a “gap” between the probabilistic representation of the world produced by the brain and the actual perceptual data coming from the environment. It engenders an increase of entropy and free energy in the brain, which would induce subjective feelings of surprise (Friston, 2009; Carhart-Harris and Friston, 2010). Thus, to reduce entropy and free energy, the brain improves progressively its Bayesian probabilistic model of the potential cause of its sensations based on previous assumptions. Continuing the Bayesian brain hypothesis and Friston’s work, Rudrauf and his colleagues (Rudrauf and Debban, 2018; Williford et al., 2018) recently introduced the “Projective Consciousness Model” (PCM) which is a projective geometrical model of the perspectival phenomenological structure of the field of consciousness2. The PCM accounts for “the states of the agent’s body in its relations to the world and to others by being constantly quantified by the processes of active inference” (Rudrauf and Debban, 2018, p. 161).

Therefore, the dispersed MN3‐M′N4 moiety is investigated systematically, including 26 homonuclear and 650 heteronuclear di‐metal systems. After, 205 stable systems are selected using lowest‐energy principle and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. According to three possible pathways, NCON, CO, and OCOH to produce urea, a five‐step high‐throughput screening method for excellent catalytic activity and a five‐aspect high‐throughput screening strategy for outstanding catalytic selectivity are proposed, respectively. The potential determined steps and the limiting potential through three pathways are identified. The data indicates both CO pathway and OCOH pathway are more competitive at lower Gibbs free energy. Significantly, the most favorite RuN3‐CoN4 combination possesses an extremely low limiting potential of −0.80 V for urea production, meanwhile it exists a strong foundation for experimental preparation. This work not only broadens electrocatalytic potentiality of developing di‐metals as two active sites, but also provides a feasible high‐throughput screening recipe for urea production.", "authors": [{"name": "Changyan Zhu", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Y.

{"title": "Collective predictive coding hypothesis: symbol emergence as decentralized Bayesian inference", "abstract": "Understanding the emergence of symbol systems, especially language, requires the construction of a computational model that reproduces both the developmental learning process in everyday life and the evolutionary dynamics of symbol emergence throughout history. This study introduces the collective predictive coding (CPC) hypothesis, which emphasizes and models the interdependence between forming internal representations through physical interactions with the environment and sharing and utilizing meanings through social semiotic interactions within a symbol emergence system. The total system dynamics is theorized from the perspective of predictive coding. The hypothesis draws inspiration from computational studies grounded in probabilistic generative models and language games, including the Metropolis–Hastings naming game. Thus, playing such games among agents in a distributed manner can be interpreted as a decentralized Bayesian inference of representations shared by a multi-agent system. Moreover, this study explores the potential link between the CPC hypothesis and the free-energy principle, positing that symbol emergence adheres to the society-wide free-energy principle. Furthermore, this paper provides a new explanation for why large language models appear to possess knowledge about the world based on experience, even though they have neither sensory organs nor bodies. This paper reviews past approaches to symbol emergence systems, offers a comprehensive survey of related prior studies, and presents a discussion on CPC-based generalizations.

{"title": "Transition-metal single atoms in nitrogen-doped graphenes as efficient active centers for water splitting: a theoretical study.", "abstract": "Highly active single-atom catalysts (SACs) have recently been intensively studied for their potential in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Due to the existence of many such SAC systems, a general understanding of the trend and designing principle is necessary to discover an optimal SAC system. In this work, by using density functional theory (DFT), we investigated a series of late single transition metals (TM = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Pd) anchored on various N doped graphenes (xN-TM, x = 1-4) as electrocatalysts for both the HER and OER. Solvent effects were taken into account using an implicit continuum model. Our results reveal that the catalytic activity of SACs is determined by the local coordination number of N and TM in the catalysts. Among the considered catalysts, a low-coordinated Co site, i.e. a triple-coordinated Co, exhibits a high catalytic activity toward the HER with a calculated hydrogen adsorption free energy of -0.01 eV, whereas a high-coordinated Co center, i.e. a quadruple-coordinated Co is a promising candidate for the OER with a low computed overpotential of -0.39 V, which are comparable to those of noble metal catalysts, indicating superior HER and OER performance of N-Co co-doped graphenes. The results shed light on the potential applications of TM and N co-doped graphenes as efficient single-atom bifunctional catalysts for water splitting, thereby functioning as promising candidates for hydrogen/oxygen production.", "authors": [{"name": "Yanan Zhou", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Guoping Gao", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Yan Li", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "W.

This work predicts extremely high catalytic activity of transition metal (Fe, Co, and Ni) promoted two‐dimensional MXenes, fully oxidized vanadium carbides (V2CO2), for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The first‐principle calculations show that the introduction of transition metal can greatly weaken the strong binding between hydrogen and oxygen and engineer the hydrogen adsorption free energy to the optimal value ≈0 eV by choosing the suitable type and coverage of the promoters as well as the active sites. Strain engineering on the performance of transition metal promoted V2CO2 further reveals that the excellent HER activities can maintain well while those poor ones can be modulated to be highly active.

{"title": "Light-controlled assembly of active colloidal molecules.", "abstract": "Thanks to a constant energy input, active matter can self-assemble into phases with complex architectures and functionalities such as living clusters that dynamically form, reshape, and break-up, which are forbidden in equilibrium materials by the entropy maximization (or free energy minimization) principle. The challenge to control this active self-assembly has evoked widespread efforts typically hinging on engineering of the properties of individual motile constituents. Here, we provide a different route, where activity occurs as an emergent phenomenon only when individual building blocks bind together in a way that we control by laser light. Using experiments and simulations of two species of immotile microspheres, we exemplify this route by creating active molecules featuring a complex array of behaviors, becoming migrators, spinners, and rotators. The possibility to control the dynamics of active self-assembly via light-controllable nonreciprocal interactions will inspire new approaches to understand living matter and to design active materials.", "authors": [{"name": "Falko Schmidt", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "B.

{"title": "Variational methods and deep Ritz method for active elastic solids.", "abstract": "Variational methods have been widely used in soft matter physics for both static and dynamic problems. These methods are mostly based on two variational principles: the variational principle of minimum free energy (MFEVP) and Onsager's variational principle (OVP). Our interests lie in the applications of these variational methods to active matter physics. In our former work [H. Wang, T. Qian and X. Xu, Soft Matter, 2021, 17, 3634-3653], we have explored the applications of OVP-based variational methods for the modeling of active matter dynamics. In the present work, we explore variational (or energy) methods that are based on MFEVP for static problems in active elastic solids. We show that MFEVP can be used not only to derive equilibrium equations, but also to develop approximate solution methods, such as the Ritz method, for active solid statics. Moreover, the power of the Ritz-type method can be further enhanced using deep learning methods if we use deep neural networks to construct the trial functions of the variational problems. We then apply these variational methods and the deep Ritz method to study the spontaneous bending and contraction of a thin active circular plate that is induced by internal asymmetric active contraction. The circular plate is found to be bent towards its contracting side. The study of such a simple toy system gives implications for understanding the morphogenesis of solid-like confluent cell monolayers. In addition, we introduce a so-called activogravity length to characterize the importance of gravitational forces relative to internal active contraction in driving the bending of the active plate. When the lateral plate dimension is larger than the activogravity length (about 100 micron), gravitational forces become important. Such gravitaxis behaviors at multicellular scales may play significant roles in the morphogenesis and in the up-down symmetry broken during tissue development.", "authors": [{"name": "Haiqin Wang", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Boyi Zou", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Jian Su", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Dong Wang", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Xin Xu", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2022, "doi": "10.1039/D2SM00404F", "arxiv_id": "2203.15376", "s2_id": "0f5c1583456db517f9c6c9eb275842bc5416441a", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "Soft Matter", "citation_count": 13, "references": ["s2:c20884d219ad6016d4309422f53782a12f35fe62", "s2:3d61fc8da88884cd3e0cda4a64333bd4d7b9b6a2", "s2:59bd33408d2fefb57ae3ab63e4afb948012cdb2d", "s2:981863c34bb44071a482206e88c7c9770b21c012", "s2:66d6a58eb45850a21d0d5682611495d98c1ac5b9", "s2:29a11f94d48bba1ed9e6b1e1f3de298608f14c11", "s2:e0cf9ec901cad58a0833ad1001950194896bf191", "s2:081e4b11962b8d6fcd338b4bcf17e7a816ad1f4b", "s2:92ff1030d6a0698d9d07416479c4590be2ce63ad", "s2:6ec8e5fa88b14fc3fcab9adcf7ac6cd226bab593", "s2:36854f2e5568e3103c9ee41587392a0227ba6f66", "s2:fc6a098fcd0bcc97b08d5ef5c9582fa1877985e6", "s2:7e5d2f6f8b884b56bf987e4d9c09ea78d1c8c23c", "s2:89818339e548f59010954cd975b1c371f41eb617", "s2:08b8008469521e74d46ecb67b41b8d76b8da40ec", "s2:9f57f55496c5b8ea12c6f34227b69620ed520481", "s2:2460e3e6708570898c7d8d661271eebe2c1a62e7", "s2:42bafe9e27273cd6a492735b1858f58bb5910377", "s2:2b2fefd30e43154c8469ce7897188b342e0acc0d", "s2:9909975dec989fcd55d99533c712c28bab99040e", "s2:7e47056720f2b5fe5e01809902891e4ec206eeab", "s2:01c1581256bf85af9c38902546f91547c2911143", "s2:292e34b380c818e9fd2c2ece7f26cd414376cd16", "s2:d86084808994ac54ef4840ae65295f3c0ec4decd", "s2:87cec0358c459ebf7b279843dab7f6d1daacbf7d", "s2:48810c7d1d943096c941e8ef5dd791a809eec2cc", "s2:50ced3da4d0d3ec7886e53d76823885632ed508c", "s2:b59ea25e684d13c31866d49e2d72740b6b3b4961", "s2:052faf9bcd3aad892c2d158c1fae4cf543ef46e8", "s2:9384f52e21d5808b5325b8510aebd8912938ceb1", "s2:21d08abf967d6ce56f72f96d8e87b2288f53a4ed", "s2:7d0633fd603d28fc067d3da1e1684595c3653d3e", "s2:6b952355f5329ad1aa11a9298c96316a62f45368", "s2:cba2fa07da7d6440839073a9d93f3637ccc4826b", "s2:6dbb13f8f49ccbf15e3e101bd6dfa27cae43cc04", "s2:154e38e0ef1000d1724ac085fabdc39483f2f3a2", "s2:423cfbabb1e37610a3db01300cbf3a69886cab26", "s2:011df4c9a0ca29e8289192ff4b787fd4b8330cd4", "s2:86e8da0eb0d966d4986d31248aeacd508a07de53", "s2:f47a7c0a3a5ced813c5cfae94bbd6895cf09e946", "s2:9979b6f1d912ad1ce8d1b9af2572001c46f67e84", "s2:cb68b1b7a79fe136a70df8427ab723abcc7faad7", "s2:f174b3a539ce0dd1e928da5df568794bdced28c9", "s2:a6cb366736791bcccc5c8639de5a8f9636bf87e8", "s2:f7d4ad09328988040d0219f6fc6d350bbb49b132", "s2:96c94530a5a17899db260b2c61403429eb41dfd5", "s2:b01f330edc15b67c97d73d3e1010eb9a553ce722", "s2:a233ab34491745dc0b00f23685f4a66a3aad1de0", "s2:e4fd390b19b2b7c30cf09af0657c051527cc1dbb", "s2:f72374ec2ed90999e46da4cab959dc32c837c6fb", "s2:fadb5c0821c75d54f6ad5e631cea469e50bf30aa", "s2:271fd583af544dc184e74aa1e758bf3e684d7291", "s2:452578612d1203278c896060da2be3aa94486a69", "s2:d7ea81a36955e7b9f9c614d12d1b1e4b19ffaf3e", "s2:e419cfbbdd1de7f9a2ed6bb2d5392840dcb2a4fd", "s2:c31d424651b987b7cfca0789f5a0d504d84b268a", "s2:55afdf4ef8fc31307e994fe8676b04ae2979c8c3", "s2:35d91380fc5b40380051003902ad1b58106071ce", "s2:bdcd3ecda8623448ecd36d7a29a533489e84d02e", "s2:46a6a945e8b747d323241d3c529db3e50655280f", "s2:b7e4781cb053d316171641c17cf96262380041ab", "s2:847df868f1d03943c03782e07e4edabef8b82972", "s2:77487d7589c077c4f0068264084fa80ec99d71ab", "s2:da2f849123def05e0fd6a1dde6063f7e4567591a", "s2:1db8cd8ffaee90a510328aee9f2f106a8c3b1b6f", "s2:c6a18ad090625f334d58599c5a544112c8a402b5", "s2:70c787477626ee0393c21252aaa0be6473a6995b", "s2:281977c8246a39ccd92ca60c8ce152b0bb675415", "s2:5aaf54183135615c016d41a56772fb1dd13cf7fb", "s2:e1cb061c8562a41c53432e7f2ccea88d96c97ca1", "s2:0c4fe3bcc105e7da15049cd99e0bda8d5a16feb4", "s2:373129fda80ba641906b2a1910fa6958c7e93272", "s2:12de2a36b894133467a948a4590206ca97ecca30", "s2:0b2ccd9ebf15498623b160de91b4afe51885ec97"], "publication_date": null}

{"title": "A Novel PODMAI Framework Enhanced by User Demand Prediction for Resource Allocation in Spectrum Sharing UAV Networks", "abstract": "Spectrum sharing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) network is a promising technology for future communication systems to mitigate the spectrum scarcity problem. However, the future sixth-generation large-scale wireless communication networks are expected not only to provide a high data rate for massive numbers of users but also to meet their stringent service requirements. Particularly in dynamic spectrum sharing UAV networks, the coupling of multi-dimensional resources and diverse user demands make the efficient and real-time resource allocation exceptionally challenging. A partially observable deep multi-agent active inference (PODMAI) framework is proposed to tackle these issues. The variational free energy is minimized to update the policy exploiting the belief based learning method. A decentralized training and execution multi-agent strategy is designed to navigate the challenges posed by partially observable information. To further satisfy the dynamic user demand and supplement partial observations, a joint spatial-temporal-attention prediction network is designed to construct the demand prediction enhanced PODMAI framework for resource allocation. Exploiting the established framework, an intelligent spectrum allocation and trajectory optimization scheme is elaborated for a spectrum sharing UAV network with multi-modal dynamic transmission rate demands. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme outperforms benchmark schemes in terms of the network sum transmission rate. Additionally, our proposed scheme exhibits faster convergence compared to the conventional reinforcement learning. Overall, our proposed framework can enrich intelligent resource allocation frameworks and pave the way for realizing real-time resource allocation.", "authors": [{"name": "Rui Ding", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Fuhui Zhou", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Qihui Wu", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Derrick Wing Kwan Ng", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "kai-kit Wong", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "N.

Continuum hydrodynamic descriptions combined with numerical simulations have been used to understand such complex systems. The development of thermodynamically consistent theories and numerical methods to model active nemato-hydrodynamics is eased by mathematical formalisms enabling systematic derivations and structured-preserving algorithms. Alternative to classical nonequilibrium thermodynamics and bracket formalisms, here we develop a theoretical and computational framework for active nematics based on Onsager’s variational formalism to irreversible thermodynamics, according to which the dynamics result from the minimization of a Rayleighian functional capturing the competition between free-energy release, dissipation and activity. We show that two standard incompressible models of active nemato-hydrodynamics can be framed in the variational formalism, and develop a new compressible model for density-dependent active nemato-hydrodynamics relevant to model actomyosin gels. We show that the variational principle enables a direct and transparent derivation not only of the governing equations, but also of the finite element numerical scheme. We exercise this model in two representative examples of active nemato-hydrodynamics relevant to the actin cytoskeleton during wound healing and to the dynamics of confined colonies of elongated cells.", "authors": [{"name": "W.

{"title": "Triple equivalence in modelling insight and creativity: classical and quantum perspectives.", "abstract": "Understanding the emergence of novel ideas in the brain-which is a hallmark of insight and creativity-remains a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. While traditional frameworks such as predictive coding, the Bayesian brain hypothesis, and the free-energy principle emphasise the approximation of external milieu states, internal generative processes that create new ideas rather than imitate remain underexplored. This review proposes a normative account of insight and creativity grounded in a triple equivalence between neural dynamics, Bayesian inference, and algorithmic computation. This equivalence provides a formal framework for understanding how neural circuits driven by mental actions can spontaneously generate creative ideas. Moreover, such creativity requires an efficient exploration of the algorithmic space to minimise free energy. Insight corresponds to a non-local search strategy that enables escape from local minima, thereby distinguishing it from conventional predictive processing. To this end, quasi-quantum neural networks that leverage superpositional coding can be considered to account for efficient global search. From this perspective, insight and creativity emerge through a self-organising exploratory process, offering a view of the brain as a spontaneous algorithm generator, rather than a predictor of its external milieu.", "authors": [{"name": "Takuya Isomura", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2026, "doi": "10.1016/j.neures.2026.105025", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": "bbd8e5d93b6aef5d2e42d128ed397d905c881f5a", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "Neurosciences research", "citation_count": 1, "references": [], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Ze and Relational QM", "abstract": "The measurement problem in quantum mechanics challenges our understanding of reality, demanding explanations beyond both Copenhagen's \"collapse\" and the Many-Worlds' ontological multiplicity. This paper introduces and formalizes the Ze framework as a novel synthesis of Relational Quantum Mechanics (RQM) and the Active Inference paradigm from theoretical neuroscience. Ze posits that quantum states are relational, defined by the posterior beliefs of interacting generative models engaged in variational free energy minimization. Within this framework, quantum superposition is formalized as high compatibility (ℐ ≈ 1) between competing models, characterized by low free-energy conflict (ΔF < θ). Conversely, the transition to a localized state—the physical correlate of \"collapse\"—is reconceived not as a metaphysical event but as an optimization-driven phase transition. This occurs when model conflict exceeds a critical threshold (ΔF > θ), a process objectively driven by interactions like which-path marking. We demonstrate that matter-wave interferometry with complex molecules provides a direct experimental testbed for these principles, where which-path information and quantum erasure actively manipulate ΔF. Extending the isomorphism, we propose that transitions in human cognition—from focused wakefulness to dreaming and psychedelic states—are governed by analogous shifts in the brain's inferential threshold (θ). Thus, Ze offers a unified, testable architecture bridging quantum foundations, statistical physics, and the neuroscience of consciousness.", "authors": [{"name": "Jaba Tkemaladze", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2026, "doi": "10.65649/223jgc16", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": "1ae0385a67e4a7ef2f7a4ff8f0b70d4eaaccde2b", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "Longevity Horizon", "citation_count": 1, "references": [], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Why Ze is not Many-Worlds", "abstract": "This paper presents a definitive refutation of the recurring conjecture that the Ze framework constitutes a variant of the Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI) of quantum mechanics. Through a systematic, point-by-point analysis, we demonstrate that the two are radically orthogonal paradigms, separated by irreconcilable differences in their foundational principles. While both reject the notion of a fundamental wavefunction collapse, MWI responds by positing an ever-branching multiverse where all quantum possibilities are ontologically real. In stark contrast, the Ze framework, grounded in the principles of active inference and free energy minimization, preserves a single-world ontology. It reinterprets quantum superpositions as manifestations of unresolved epistemic model conflict within an adaptive system, and \"measurement\" as the physical process of forced localization, where a definite history crystallizes. The analysis conclusively distinguishes Ze from MWI across critical dimensions: the nature of alternatives (ontological worlds vs. epistemic models), the process of definiteness (subjective branching vs. objective optimization), the role of the observer (covert privilege vs. its elimination), and the capacity for empirical prediction. We conclude that Ze is not an interpretation of quantum formalism but a broader theory of how adaptive systems, from particles to brains, resolve uncertainty, thereby offering a monistic, parsimonious, and empirically grounded alternative to the inflationary ontology of the multiverse.", "authors": [{"name": "Jaba Tkemaladze", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2026, "doi": "10.65649/fyd9x473", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": "b10f42b48d81c71bb892f7dc9b295b0960d2c90c", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "Longevity Horizon", "citation_count": 1, "references": [], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Neural relational inference to learn long-range allosteric interactions in proteins from molecular dynamics simulations", "abstract": "Protein allostery is a biological process facilitated by spatially long-range intra-protein communication, whereby ligand binding or amino acid change at a distant site affects the active site remotely. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation provides a powerful computational approach to probe the allosteric effect. However, current MD simulations cannot reach the time scales of whole allosteric processes. The advent of deep learning made it possible to evaluate both spatially short and long-range communications for understanding allostery. For this purpose, we applied a neural relational inference model based on a graph neural network, which adopts an encoder-decoder architecture to simultaneously infer latent interactions for probing protein allosteric processes as dynamic networks of interacting residues. From the MD trajectories, this model successfully learned the long-range interactions and pathways that can mediate the allosteric communications between distant sites in the Pin1, SOD1, and MEK1 systems. Furthermore, the model can discover allostery-related interactions earlier in the MD simulation trajectories and predict relative free energy changes upon mutations more accurately than other methods. Here, the authors apply a neural relational inference model to infer dynamic networks of interacting residues in protein molecular dynamics simulations.

{"title": "Robust Active Simultaneous Localization and Mapping Based on Bayesian Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning", "abstract": "Autonomous mobile robots play vital roles in business, industry, manufacturing, e-commerce, and healthcare. Autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance involve localizing a robot to actively explore and map an unknown environment autonomously without prior knowledge. Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) present a severe challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach for robust navigation and robot action mapping based on Bayesian Actor-Critic (A2C) reinforcement learning. The principle of Actor-Critic combines policy-based and value-based learning by splitting the model into two: the policy model (Actor) computes the action based on the state, and the value model (Critic) tracks whether the agent is ahead or behind during the game. That feedback guides the training process, where both models participate in a game and optimize their output as time passes. We develop a Bayesian A2C model that generates robot actions and quantifies uncertainty on the actions toward robust exploration and collision-free navigation. We adopt the Bayesian inference and optimize the variational posterior distribution over the unknown model parameters using the evidence lower bound (ELBO) objective. The first-order Taylor series approximates the mean and covariance of the variational distribution passed through non-linear functions in the A2C model. The propagated covariance estimates the robot's action uncertainty at the output of the Actor-network. Experiments demonstrate the superior robustness of the proposed Bayesian A2C model exploring heavily noisy environments compared to deterministic homologs. The proposed framework can be applied to other fields of research (underwater robots, biomedical devices/robots, micro-robots, drones, etc.) where robustness and uncertainty quantification are critical.", "authors": [{"name": "Bryan Pedraza", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Dimah Dera", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2023, "doi": "10.1109/CAI54212.2023.00035", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": "df7ac37196861f18508feefb1ddc32bbbd79edcc", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "Conference on Algebraic Informatics", "citation_count": 2, "references": [], "publication_date": null}

In this work, we synthesized NbSi\n x\n Te\n 2\n crystals and evaluated their electrocatalytic HER performance in experiments. The NbSi\n 0.43\n Te\n 2\n bulk crystal catalyst shows a series of remarkable HER properties, such as a low overpotential of 67.38 mV at 10 mA cm\n −2\n , a Tafel slope as low as 28.68 mV dec\n −1\n and a long‐term stability for 50 h at a high potential of −360 mV. As theoretical analyses suggest, excellent HER performance of NbSi\n 0.43\n Te\n 2\n bulk crystals comes from the high density of active sites, near‐zero free energy, as well as high electron mobility along NbTe\n 2\n chains due to its nontrivial topological states. This work provides a novel and effective exploration pathway for utilizing quantum topological materials as high‐performance HER electrocatalysts.\n", "authors": [{"name": "Xi Sun", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Zhen Wang", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Bin‐Xin Zhu", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Yu Liu", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Yucheng Kan", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Feng Du", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "M.

{"title": "Nanoscale Lattice Organization of Molecular Condensates Drives Compositional Degeneracy in Synaptic Plasticity", "abstract": "Synaptic plasticity is essential for neuronal communication, involving coordinated structural, molecular and functional changes that are shaped by the nanoscale alterations of the active zone and postsynaptic density. Emerging evidence suggests that synapses function as complex information processing machines, where unique molecular assemblies shape transmission properties. Central to this is the organization of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) and Bassoon within active zones. Utilizing advanced techniques like liquid-liquid phase separation, super-resolution microscopy, and data-driven models of synaptic transmission, we reveal how nanoscale \"compositional degeneracy\" in Bassoon and VGCCs enables synapses to achieve functional adaptability through multiple molecular configurations. By modulation of local uncertainty and implementing probabilistic inference, synapses fine-tune transmission efficiency by regulating dynamic entropy and free energy. These principles are especially evident during homeostatic scaling, where synaptic scaling mechanisms differ with neuronal maturity. This study highlights how distinct thermodynamic states in VGCC and Bassoon organization optimize information transfer at different plasticity stages. Our findings propose a refined framework for understanding synaptic transmission as an adaptable, entropy-modulated process, balancing resilience and efficiency.", "authors": [{"name": "Pallavi Rao Netrakanti", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Yukti Chopra", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Richa Agarwal", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Premchand Rajeev", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Shekhar Kedia", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Mini Jose", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "S.

{"title": "Resonant closure: consciousness as a dynamically self-stabilized informational state", "abstract": "\n Why some physical systems are accompanied by subjective experience remains unresolved in neuroscience and philosophy of mind. Building on predictive processing and the Free Energy Principle, I propose that phenomenal consciousness (what-it-is-like-ness) arises when an information-processing system enters a regime of dynamic entropic closure: a metastable condition in which (i) internally generated predictions and (ii) incoming sensory signals are recursively coupled such that net informational entropy exchange with the environment is minimized while internal informational dynamics remain high. In this regime, inference loops become phase-coherent and self-referential, producing a persistent informational pattern—\n resonant closure\n —that constitutes awareness. The framework is compatible with, but conceptually distinct from, Integrated Information Theory and global-workspace style accounts. I formalize core constructs at the level of operational constraints, address objections regarding trivial closure and “stationarity,” and derive falsifiable empirical predictions for neurophysiology.\n", "authors": [{"name": "B.

{"title": "Computational Analysis of Structure – Activity Relationships in Highly Active Homogeneous Ruthenium-based Water Oxidation Catalysts", "abstract": "Linear free energy scaling relationships (LFESRs) and regression analysis may predict the catalytic performance of heterogeneous and recently, homogenous water oxidation catalysts (WOCs). This study analyses twelve homogeneous Ru-based catalysts – some, the most active catalysts studied: the Ru(tpy-R)(QC) and Ru(tpy-R)(4-pic)2 catalysts, where tpy is 2,2:6,2-terpyridine, QC is 8-quinolinecarboxylate and 4-pic is 4-picoline. Typical relationships studied among heterogenous and solid-state catalysts cannot be broadly applied to homogeneous catalysts. This subset of structurally similar catalysts with impressive catalytic activity deserves closer computational and statistical analysis of energetics correlating with measured catalytic activity. We report general methods of LFESR analysis yield insufficiently robust relationships between descriptor variables. However, volcano plot-based analysis grounded in Sabatier’s principle reveals ranges of ideal relative energies of the RuIV=O and RuIV-OH intermediates and optimal changes in free energies of water nucleophilic attack on RuV=O. A narrow range of RuIV-OH to RuV=O redox potentials corresponding with the highest catalytic activities suggests facile access to the catalytically competent high-valent RuV=O state, often inaccessible from RuIV=O. Our work introduces experimental oxygen evolution rates into approaches of LFESR and Sabatier principle-based analysis, identifying a narrow yet fertile energetic landscape to bountiful oxygen-evolution activity, leading future rational design.", "authors": [{"name": "G.

{"title": "A Measure of Information Available for Inference", "abstract": "The mutual information between the state of a neural network and the state of the external world represents the amount of information stored in the neural network that is associated with the external world. In contrast, the surprise of the sensory input indicates the unpredictability of the current input. In other words, this is a measure of inference ability, and an upper bound of the surprise is known as the variational free energy. According to the free-energy principle (FEP), a neural network continuously minimizes the free energy to perceive the external world. For the survival of animals, inference ability is considered to be more important than simply memorized information. In this study, the free energy is shown to represent the gap between the amount of information stored in the neural network and that available for inference. This concept involves both the FEP and the infomax principle, and will be a useful measure for quantifying the amount of information available for inference.", "authors": [{"name": "Takuya Isomura", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2018, "doi": "10.3390/e20070512", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": "666f5c76ecbe9a955c147fd064359f5de3b9f8ad", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "Entropy", "citation_count": 8, "references": ["s2:29c283bb6ce9382fa952eab56b915105e3b55e00", "s2:6ad1d28df414274e4367b6d36fe125875c145920", "s2:eeed395b54bdb65c0e23eb078e43598eb25b57d7", "s2:f479baf76010dac0afefc00a94171fae443373ff", "s2:9adde02f287504908bb329e53a3ba7fa5405f778", "s2:5d809dafca59ae4a743c47f5add40c586d199931", "s2:9179b179c45bdaa633a50c350a0fee0239a9b22c", "s2:90b91d6c86aa2c20bc0e6539b8d86725dd1390c3", "s2:f6b20a4c30a1319c69b6b3c9fa11783b7f9ba73d", "s2:f67acb676318c741f592be7cee09dee136913aa7", "s2:23f61398166030346d0f99c94a3106ae4f3ec982", "s2:9d91dead9612e1c6a8dd9ae3793fe697565c744e", "s2:deb21863dc3a36cf6630856a126807cc2b18dc67", "s2:8b370be84b939e56a3833ceebebb802a6dc9638d", "s2:755bfd4f8060d5fcda64eaedb81a520ab7c8bdba", "s2:50d548af47e5003e96bafb4ce4119a75c0a6d403", "s2:9f992b8e07689b8ae3da1a761472daeb82c544c9", "s2:3bc8c19cd2257790f2c92c0b6b757c0550a8404b", "s2:c4492b7114e520e5dd04582bd84b5bfee3b91610", "s2:9258b404f89d6188711a12a1f7f622c0af557bf2", "s2:1ed6a4a10589618d4f26350f1a296ee767ceff6b", "s2:e8e8283f380f02bbcaf8990a6a19639ee760e45c", "s2:35f304e3b47ae4008108916476801df89bcceccf", "s2:5e07da2914783a21980ecc1cea688d1333e6b6e4", "s2:94ccf73ef7f315db45deb3dfc7537315d22a9478", "s2:1a014a076cac3c7f5d81a084e296c095f9230437", "s2:28fb9defdb7c4f2caec2653eb6dcd953d51712c1", "s2:c741859fba34d1b44bedbb167e9777eaf7a05af4", "s2:668b1277fbece28c4841eeab1c97e4ebd0079700", "s2:641a9d87b9636d4ef2e353a569ddede68bd29131", "s2:d43975ac74051640e9fa9be569f1abc3aa475ab2", "s2:7dbdb4209626fd92d2436a058663206216036e68", "s2:f1f781f1a07526d19dbd2b2b2d1303ed03455ed8", "s2:d671009b1b02b6cf8a701c63515486e99f6c5300", "s2:8fcbc38e7196b0dc8748f04cd6101e71f92c158e", "s2:ff4d69e8854a6e083a193b50ed29f4c738751bee", "s2:4b7cc36c7af294305da8ec5ebdc1b350682ee53f", "s2:00d1f4def02beaa70edf4ab4a23d1e5cbe2f0aef", "s2:106a7910cf1bf53f3ff1a90455e863d3b2e1373c", "s2:e5f231cdfbf7499a7af1d2775f250b715f79ba58", "s2:ca1d23be869380ac9e900578c601c2d1febcc0c9", "s2:2805537bec87a6177037b18f9a3a9d3f1038867b", "s2:8880484e4be05f8eabf408e7a9267e8214e411fe", "s2:1889e9f39f76abf8a64b9d6a8167b04f9f790115", "s2:8012c4a1e2ca663f1a04e80cbb19631a00cbab27", "s2:fac0e753905d1498e0b3debf01431696e1f0c645", "s2:1d7d0e8c4791700defd4b0df82a26b50055346e0", "s2:605402e235bd62437baf3c9ebefe77fb4d92ee95", "s2:d31b4018bb789d878b7d3dbb85d08ffcb1489948", "s2:026e9b04bab73d3a34cd37f8b290f0c8f6da5f4e", "s2:07d5b6feed90d57bd9fd042826cd54b8ed0bbee2", "s2:18aa8a0502e717c114312a3ba63dbb76fbcab47c", "s2:16d70e8af45ca0ae2c1bb73f3be6628518d40b8f", "s2:08b67692bc037eada8d3d7ce76cc70994e7c8116", "s2:c054360ec3ccadae977fdd0d77694c9655478a41", "s2:0fdd66fcf6b9bc04428e337df66fd510a659eb2f", "s2:2913c2bf3f92b5ae369400a42b2d27cc5bc05ecb", "s2:cab3ac346fe205d814876cd821f2b682c715bc20", "s2:268b8f10a45e71f63daab6403bb453da31ae28a7", "s2:6d12a1d23b21a9b170118a56386552bc5d4727de", "s2:887539061b4dec2439180eb58c2d6eae13f24548", "s2:849f849f647bc8d49c025dc408f4e927e12bceec", "s2:d5ad1fdd277219257c38df86770c9fd68f4c74f0", "s2:4eb35c07a0d6162ac09c0269b473ef464d920e0d", "s2:a424ec3b8846f57b8ffdb566d272e28d5a525909", "s2:bc56a45e112edaa90333296eb33733180c51d38e", "s2:0eddb03e19bcf7555042508145426451da1d5c7f", "s2:06cb198e97883a7d396e805231a794e4e65276b1"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "MAGNETIC ENERGY AND HELICITY BUDGETS IN THE ACTIVE-REGION SOLAR CORONA. II. NONLINEAR FORCE-FREE APPROXIMATION", "abstract": "Expanding on an earlier work that relied on linear force-free (LFF) magnetic fields, we self-consistently derive the instantaneous free magnetic energy and relative magnetic helicity budgets of an unknown three-dimensional nonlinear force-free (NLFF) magnetic structure extending above a single known lower-boundary magnetic field vector. The proposed method does not rely on the detailed knowledge of the three-dimensional field configuration but is general enough to employ only a magnetic connectivity matrix on the lower boundary. The calculation yields a minimum free magnetic energy and a relative magnetic helicity consistent with this free magnetic energy. The method is directly applicable to photospheric or chromospheric vector magnetograms of solar active regions. Upon validation, it basically reproduces magnetic energies and helicities obtained by well known, but computationally more intensive and non-unique, methods relying on the extrapolated three-dimensional magnetic field vector. We apply the method to three active regions, calculating the photospheric connectivity matrices by means of simulated annealing, rather than a model-dependent NLFF extrapolation. For two of these regions we correct for the inherent LFF overestimation in free energy and relative helicity that is larger for larger, more eruptive, active regions. In the third region studied, our calculation can lead to a physical interpretation of observed eruptive manifestations. We conclude that the proposed method, including the proposed inference of the magnetic connectivity matrix, is practical enough to contribute to a physical interpretation of the dynamical evolution of solar active regions.", "authors": [{"name": "M.

In the theoretical framework of predictive coding and active inference, the brain can be viewed as instantiating a rich generative model of the world that predicts incoming sensory data while continuously updating its parameters via minimization of prediction errors. While this theory has been successfully applied to cognitive processes—by modelling the activity of functional neural networks at a mesoscopic scale—the validity of the approach when modelling neurons as an ensemble of inferring agents, in a biologically plausible architecture, remained to be explored. Approach. We modelled a simplified cerebellar circuit with individual neurons acting as Bayesian agents to simulate the classical delayed eyeblink conditioning protocol. Neurons and synapses adjusted their activity to minimize their prediction error, which was used as the network cost function. This cerebellar network was then implemented in hardware by replicating digital neuronal elements via a low-power microcontroller. Main results. Persistent changes of synaptic strength—that mirrored neurophysiological observations—emerged via local (neurocentric) prediction error minimization, leading to the expression of associative learning. The same paradigm was effectively emulated in low-power hardware showing remarkably efficient performance compared to conventional neuromorphic architectures. Significance. These findings show that: (a) an ensemble of free energy minimizing neurons—organized in a biological plausible architecture—can recapitulate functional self-organization observed in nature, such as associative plasticity, and (b) a neuromorphic network of inference units can learn unsupervised tasks without embedding predefined learning rules in the circuit, thus providing a potential avenue to a novel form of brain-inspired artificial intelligence.", "authors": [{"name": "Daniela Gandolfi", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "F.

{"title": "Tailoring Advanced N-Defective and S-Doped g-C3 N4 for Photocatalytic H2 Evolution.", "abstract": "Although challenges remain, synergistic adjusting various microstructures and photo/electrochemical parameters of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3 N4 ) in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are the keys to alleviating the energy crisis and environmental pollution. In this work, a novel nitrogen-defective and sulfur-doped g-C3 N4 (S-g-C3 N4 -D) is designed elaborately. Subsequent physical and chemical characterization proved that the developed S-g-C3 N4 -D not only displays well-defined 2D lamellar morphology with a large porosity and a high specific surface area but also has an efficient light utilization and carriers-separation and transfer. Moreover, the calculated optimal Gibbs free energy of adsorbed hydrogen (ΔGH* ) for S-g-C3 N4 -D at the S active sites is close to zero (≈0.24 eV) on the basis of first-principle density functional theory (DFT). Accordingly, the developed S-g-C3 N4 -D catalyst shows a high H2 evolution rate of 5651.5 µmol g-1  h-1 . Both DFT calculations and experimental results reveal that a memorable defective g-C3 N4 /S-doped g-C3 N4 step-scheme heterojunction is constructed between S-doped domains and N-defective domains in the structural configuration of S-g-C3 N4 -D.

{"title": "Discovery of Efficient Acidic Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalyst: High‐Throughput Computational Screening of MgIrRu Oxide", "abstract": "Ensuring high catalytic activity and durability remains a significant challenge in the development of electrocatalysts toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE). This study introduces a new research paradigm through high‐throughput density functional theory (DFT) calculations to screen efficient acidic OER electrocatalysts, guided by the principle of minimizing thermodynamic free energy and optimizing the adsorption energies of OER intermediates. The incorporation of Ir increases the formation energy of oxygen vacancies and suppresses the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) of the RuO2, thereby enhancing its stability. In addition, Mg modulates the electronic structure of Ru and optimizes the adsorption energies of OER intermediates, thus improving the OER activity of the RuO2. Electrochemical results reveal that Mg0.23Ir0.13Ru0.64O2 exhibits a low overpotential of 191 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and superior mass activity of 338.6 A gnoble‐metal−1 at 1.46 V. The PEMWE with Mg0.23Ir0.13Ru0.64O2 as anode catalyst achieves a current density of 1.0 A cm−2 at a low electrolysis voltage of 1.81 V and steadily operates at 0.5 A cm−2 for 42 h with a decay of only 909.5 µV h−1.

{"title": "Active strategies for multisensory conflict suppression in the virtual hand illusion", "abstract": "The perception of our body in space is flexible and manipulable. The predictive brain hypothesis explains this malleability as a consequence of the interplay between incoming sensory information and our body expectations. However, given the interaction between perception and action, we might also expect that actions would arise due to prediction errors, especially in conflicting situations. Here we describe a computational model, based on the free-energy principle, that forecasts involuntary movements in sensorimotor conflicts. We experimentally confirm those predictions in humans using a virtual reality rubber-hand illusion. Participants generated movements (forces) towards the virtual hand, regardless of its location with respect to the real arm, with little to no forces produced when the virtual hand overlaid their physical hand. The congruency of our model predictions and human observations indicates that the brain-body is generating actions to reduce the prediction error between the expected arm location and the new visual arm. This observed unconscious mechanism is an empirical validation of the perception–action duality in body adaptation to uncertain situations and evidence of the active component of predictive processing.", "authors": [{"name": "Pablo Lanillos", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Sae Franklin", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "A.

{"title": "Design of active bifunctional electrocatalysts using single atom doped transition metal dichalcogenides", "abstract": "Abstract Single atom catalyst is designed to achieve high catalytic activity while extremely minimizing precious metal loadings for electrochemical energy conversion and storage applications. Using first-principles density functional theory calculations, we screen 48 combinations of single atom catalysts anchored at defective monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (A1/TMD; A = Ni, Cu, Pd, Ag, Pt and Au; TM = Mo, W, Nb and Ta; D = S and Se). With established methodologies, we identify five best catalysts for each of oxygen reduction/evolution and hydrogen evolution reactions among the stable candidates. A scaling relation between the Gibb’s free energy for intermediates is figured out to understand the governing mechanism of single atom catalysts with varying transition metal dichalcogenides supports and to introduce key descriptor. Pt1/MoS2 is proposed as the best bifunctional catalyst for oxygen reduction/evolution reaction. In addition, Pt1/NbSe2 and Pt1/TaS2 are promising candidates for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions. Treating the support itself as an active site for hydrogen evolution reaction, Pd1/NbS2 and Pt1/NbS2 are proposed as potential bifunctional catalysts toward oxygen reduction and evolution reaction, respectively.

{"title": "Catalytic enzymes are active matter", "abstract": "Significance Catalysis and mobility of reactants in fluid are normally thought to be decoupled. Violating this classical paradigm, this paper presents the catalyst laws of motion. Comparing experimental data to the theory presented here, we conclude that part of the free energy released by chemical reaction is channeled into driving catalysts to execute wormlike trajectories by piconewton forces performing work of a few kBT against fluid viscosity, where the rotational diffusion rate dictates the trajectory persistence length. This active motion agitates the fluid medium and produces antichemotaxis, the migration of catalyst down the gradient of the reactant concentration. Alternative explanations of enhanced catalyst mobility are examined critically. Using a microscopic theory to analyze experiments, we demonstrate that enzymes are active matter. Superresolution fluorescence measurements—performed across four orders of magnitude of substrate concentration, with emphasis on the biologically relevant regime around or below the Michaelis–Menten constant—show that catalysis boosts the motion of enzymes to be superdiffusive for a few microseconds, enhancing their effective diffusivity over longer timescales. Occurring at the catalytic turnover rate, these fast ballistic leaps maintain direction over a duration limited by rotational diffusion, driving enzymes to execute wormlike trajectories by piconewton forces performing work of a few kBT against viscosity. The boosts are more frequent at high substrate concentrations, biasing the trajectories toward substrate-poor regions, thus exhibiting antichemotaxis, demonstrated here experimentally over a wide range of aqueous concentrations. Alternative noncatalytic, passive mechanisms that predict chemotaxis, cross-diffusion, and phoresis, are critically analyzed. We examine the physical interpretation of our findings, speculate on the underlying mechanism, and discuss the avenues they open with biological and technological implications. These findings violate the classical paradigm that chemical reaction and motility are distinct processes, and suggest reaction–motion coupling as a general principle of catalysis.", "authors": [{"name": "Ah-Young Jee", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Yoon‐Kyoung Cho", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "S.

{"title": "Electronic Structure Based Intuitive Design Principle of Single‐Atom Catalysts for Efficient Electrolytic Nitrogen Reduction", "abstract": "As an alternative to cost‐ and energy intensive Haber‐Bosch process, the implementation of electrolytic ammonia synthesis from dinitrogen molecule has been a long‐sought goal. State‐of‐the‐art electrocatalysts for nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) face not only activity but also selectivity problem with the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Recently, single‐atom catalysts (SACs) have emerged as promising for various reactions as they combine the best of homogenous and heterogenous catalysts. The reason for their high activity compared to their bulk and nanoparticle counterparts are yet to be completely understood. Inspired by the structure of nitrogenase FeMo cofactor, here we studied 13 transition metals anchored on MoS2 monolayer at Mo‐top positions, as possible electrolytic NRR catalysts using first‐principles methods. Employing the implicit solvation model, we calculated free energy barriers for proton abstraction by N2 molecule in end‐on configuration and adsorption free energy of hydrogen on all SACs. Based on these two parameters, Fe, Co, and Ru were found to be the most active and highly selective electrolytic NRR catalysts. Compared with other mechanisms, the limiting potentials (and hence activity) for enzymatic mechanism were found to be higher on these three SACs, with Ru SAC having a very low overpotential of 0.38 V vs SHE. Bader charge transferred from transition metal to N2 molecule and group number of transition metals correlate strongly with the NRR activity and hence emerge as two key descriptors for catalytic activity. These intuitive principles for rational designing of promising alternatives to the currently used bulk Ru(0001) catalyst could accelerate the search for highly efficient and selective SACs for electrolytic NRR.", "authors": [{"name": "Ritesh Kumar", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "A.

Oxidation of tryptophan results in electrowetting of this residue. This structural change makes the free energy surfaces of electron transfer nonparabolic as described by the Q-model of electron transfer. We analyze the medium dynamical effect on protein electron transfer produced by coupled Stokes-shift dynamics and the dynamics of the donor-acceptor distance modulating electron tunneling. The equilibrium donor-acceptor distance falls in the plateau region of the rate constant, where it is determined by the protein-water dynamics, and the probability of electron tunneling does not affect the rate. The crossover distance found here puts most intraprotein electron-transfer reactions under the umbrella of dynamical control. The crossover between the medium-controlled and tunneling-controlled kinetics is combined with the effect of the protein-water medium on the activation barrier to formulate principles of tunability of protein-based charge-transfer chains. The main principle in optimizing the activation barrier is the departure from the Gaussian-Gibbsian statistics of fluctuations promoting activated transitions. This is achieved either by incomplete (nonergodic) sampling, breaking the link between the Stokes-shift and variance reorganization energies, or through wetting-induced structural changes of the enzyme's active site.", "authors": [{"name": "S.

Here, we review recent studies on intrinsic catalytic activity of two-dimensional (2D) semimetals, particularly among transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), highlighting promising strategies for the design of materials to further enhance their catalytic performances. An attractive approach for active HER is fabricating single-atom catalysts in the framework of TMDs. While electrochemical reaction at a catalytic atom for hydrogen evolution has been discussed by the Sabatier principle, we describe the phenomenon by Gibbs free energy for hydrogen adsorption via down-sizing, alloying, hybridizing, hetero-structuring, and phase boundary engineering mostly with TMDs.

{"title": "The Work Capacity of Channels with Memory: Maximum Extractable Work in Percept-Action Loops", "abstract": "Predicting future observations plays a central role in machine learning, biology, economics, and many other fields. It lies at the heart of organizational principles such as the variational free energy principle and has even been shown -- based on the second law of thermodynamics -- to be necessary for reaching the fundamental energetic limits of sequential information processing. While the usefulness of the predictive paradigm is undisputed, complex adaptive systems that interact with their environment are more than just predictive machines: they have the power to act upon their environment and cause change. In this work, we develop a framework to analyze the thermodynamics of information processing in percept-action loops -- a model of agent-environment interaction -- allowing us to investigate the thermodynamic implications of actions and percepts on equal footing. To this end, we introduce the concept of work capacity -- the maximum rate at which an agent can expect to extract work from its environment. Our results reveal that neither of two previously established design principles for work-efficient agents -- maximizing predictive power and forgetting past actions -- remains optimal in environments where actions have observable consequences. Instead, a trade-off emerges: work-efficient agents must balance prediction and forgetting, as remembering past actions can reduce the available free energy.

{"title": "Engineering Single-Atom Electrocatalysts for Enhancing Kinetics of Acidic Volmer Reaction.", "abstract": "The design of active and low-cost electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is the key to achieving a clean hydrogen energy infrastructure. The most successful design principle of hydrogen electrocatalyst is the activity volcano plot, which is based on Sabatier principle and has been used to understand the exceptional activity of noble metal and design of metal alloy catalysts. However, this application of volcano plot in designing single-atom electrocatalysts (SAEs) on nitrogen doped graphene (TM/N4C catalysts) for HER has been less successful due to the nonmetallic nature of the single metal atom site. Herein, by performing ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations on a series of SAEs systems (TM/N4C with TM = 3d, 4d, or 5d metals), we find that the strong charge-dipole interaction between the negatively charged *H intermediate and the interfacial H2O molecules could alter the transition path of the acidic Volmer reaction and dramatically raise its kinetic barrier, despite its favorable adsorption free energy. Such kinetic hindrance is also experimentally confirmed by electrochemical measurements. By combining the hydrogen adsorption free energy and the physics of competing interfacial interactions, we propose a unifying design principle for engineering the SAEs used for hydrogen energy conversion, which incorporates both thermodynamic and kinetic considerations and allows going beyond the activity volcano model.", "authors": [{"name": "Hao Cao", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Qilun Wang", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Zisheng Zhang", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Huiying Yan", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Hongyan Zhao", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Hong Bin Yang", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Bin Liu", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Jun Yu Li", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Yang‐Gang Wang", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2023, "doi": "10.1021/jacs.2c13418", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": "17f1a45df6be8e074fd8485d26abc09ea2b07a93", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "Journal of the American Chemical Society", "citation_count": 56, "references": [], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Mutation-Induced Resistance of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro to WU-04 Revealed by Multi-Scale Modeling", "abstract": "The clinical durability of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) inhibitors depends on their resilience to emerging resistance mutations. Recent genomic surveillance and functional reports have highlighted substitutions at positions 49, 165, and 301, raising questions about the robustness of the noncovalent inhibitor WU-04 in variant backgrounds. Here, we combined μs-scale, triplicate molecular dynamics simulations with end-state binding free energy estimates and a network-rewiring inference (NRI) framework that maps long-range dynamical communication across the full protease dimer. We evaluated wild type (WT), single mutants M49K, M165V, S301P, and selected double mutants (M49K & M165V, M49K & S301P). Relative to WT, single substitutions produced reductions in computed binding affinity of up to ~12kcal/mol, accompanied by loss or reshaping of the S2 subsite and altered ligand burial. Notably, the M49K/S301P double mutant partially restored WU-04 engagement, narrowing the ΔΔGrestore gap to within ΔΔGrestore of WT and re-establishing key hydrophobic and hydrogen-bond contacts. NRI analysis revealed that distal residue 301 participates in a communication corridor linking the C-terminal helical domain to the active-site cleft; its substitution rewires inter-domain coupling that can compensate for local disruptions at residue 49. Together, these results identify structural hotspots and network pathways that may inform the design of next-generation Mpro inhibitors with improved mutation tolerance—specifically by strengthening interactions that do not rely solely on the mutable S2 pocket and by engaging conserved backbone features near the 165–166 region.", "authors": [{"name": "Mengting Liu", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Derui Zhao", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Hui Duan", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Junyao Zhu", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Liting Zheng", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Nan Yuan", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Yuan-Lin Xia", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Peng Sang", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Liquan Yang", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2026, "doi": "10.3390/ijms27021000", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": "c66bd217a4ea14823d8a14c1a4620efc625753ea", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "International Journal of Molecular Sciences", "citation_count": 0, "references": ["s2:7a3092b4244930b9e736932377d337b1a9682c2f", "s2:5955ab16de098bdb06bc4c4242b6e817e31197ee", "s2:55a0e14976c9f52195957673e8dff62809301e40", "s2:a57eac3abd4d8a07dfb0716870371ca826e94900", "s2:93e3524654e15f1a683b1f661d5b111ce2dbc942", "s2:ed8f7c0ed9962f54dd89b7ae88ce351d0eebea31", "s2:945cf26154d8eeaa618c58d1f3bd9cda02dee3b1", "s2:b1a09e0916269c39e4b14590627f14d85cb1a2f7", "s2:1f7babafebb8bbf3d0d17392c8ec5ca335aa889b", "s2:3aaeab62f38485efb1dc0af782c390ce8c925e71", "s2:ee2c781c0d0f7092fb03d29a55660b2a6b504f9f", "s2:eaad1865050f8213ecae404d5e8b014441b520fd", "s2:96c088c386144ae173a0a68d9e60e2406a3fe562", "s2:f7728b3de11198517991a52fa7778da0572dd795", "s2:b9ca8f34a8f78089c1760291f790d0ebeee9c06a", "s2:136e519843a3af09023ff2076672623cb0b9a113", "s2:06b3a0e41319a27f107ef20a46fd99c5a6e0e072", "s2:fa13632c756a92f0f5fc47f337de3890133482d7", "s2:6860066fbf9348e518789774472d118cb0baa5a0", "s2:2b157007e77f09b9337492bf7c1b8b33df53db29", "s2:f1f9795af29371f491d7d6dd6f1092d7ee1ebef4", "s2:f1441e3ea1d9fa1a144e733b06c9c7c86a20449e", "s2:679904bd007ec759714f30610db445bd43775cf2", "s2:106fa4eb33b276bcf7f4eb4933d32e3967ce3510", "s2:8d2c3c68c7ee7c7ee2c7c62ee28ed9af6c1a55c5", "s2:ca9f24c7a44f260543756ce7960c0a9b9f30d747", "s2:9ddaaa3288cfee91e9d43a7916f0bcf3a5a3c530", "s2:de2ec8c9e0a56421ead8ac67978064a20e3df634", "s2:49d40250c1bf1eb95b5c8caa3c2f663f336f117d", "s2:51dd07564a6ae6f5aa28c8f078fed2a816caafc6", "s2:89ca73908f84ac32e1b73b259b321b0e7b076842", "s2:0937d71328befd3107326f509413c27a9cb1277f", "s2:906947ee847fb92b45cf61876aff435d73a82489", "s2:c8fbd2e8a5b818cd3ee0748795282be58647b883", "s2:9d1c37d325262cd94643c61a4f7bfd41e3928e0c", "s2:e001be8e9c1049809430fb4b75985af17921e52e", "s2:d7f0d01711855d236a8683cae11307da1610efc7", "s2:4dcf1ba0e71f692fac74ba0343a97f1c38e4a0d4", "s2:27634a93a65328d946cf285a4d5002e8da682b8c", "s2:a09401bda09519144ef2eeb9efb026764e221e6e", "s2:109e3051bd2183d887b7f4ba8e768079039fad7f", "s2:84ef1da11aa9a393c89f70360eae40cb238fc2ba", "s2:c1cb8af97a5aecc3f78a3f0a6a285b841c6c404c", "s2:9c61e6d01cb2c7c62eff43553531a0df62387784", "s2:897172c2bff121370e4454cccb685a51dd2a2fba", "s2:8943625f88f49ba563900a21915f40476206dba9"], "publication_date": null}

The aim is to identify the role of FEP in driving a paradigm shift in understanding psychopathology by reviewing and synthesizing findings from various empirical studies. To achieve this, the study applies a qualitative meta-synthesis approach, focusing on articles that apply FEP in the context of clinical psychology and neurobiology, while excluding theoretical studies that lack empirical data or are less relevant to clinical psychology. The research design follows a qualitative approach to replace statistical analysis on psychopathological symptoms, with inclusion criteria encompassing empirical studies on the application of FEP in mental disorders, and exclusion criteria for theoretical studies without empirical data. The main research question addressed is how the Free Energy Principle can provide a novel understanding of the mechanisms of mental disorders compared to traditional theories of psychopathology. The findings reveal that FEP offers a more adaptive theoretical framework for explaining cognitive dysfunction in mental disorders, particularly highlighting the brain's failure to update predictive models. This study concludes that FEP has the potential to drive a paradigm shift in clinical psychology, paving the way for more targeted and adaptive therapeutic approaches for mental health conditions.\nKeywords: Free Energy Principle, Schizophrenia, Depression, Anxiety, Paradigm Shift, Psychopathology, Active Inference, Karl Friston, Clinical Psychology.", "authors": [{"name": "Mohamad Ramdhani", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2025, "doi": "10.26486/jdp.v2i1.4257", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": "c66052cd63f75c4ec744f778bae234b7bb94ac2d", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "Dinamika Psikologis: Jurnal Ilmiah Psikologis", "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "A Cognitive Perspective on Information Frictions in Labor Markets", "abstract": "During the Great Recession, labor markets often exhibit a slow unemployment recovery and persistent outward shifts in the Beveridge curve, which suggests a decline in the efficiency of the job-matching process. While it is often explained by worker search intensity, we argue that the direction of search behavior also matters by proposing a stylized theoretical model based on the Free Energy Principle. Through modeling agents who actively divide their effort between applying for jobs and learning about the market’s new state, our framework shows that agents endogenously shift effort from applications to learning when their uncertainty is high. Building on this micro-foundation, we design a macroeconomic model where matching efficiency is no longer an external parameter but is instead governed by two cognitive factors: the share of unemployed workers with misaligned beliefs and the average learning effort of the informed. Simulation results show that a structural shock will divert effort to learning and depress matching by creating widespread uncertainty, and the subsequent slow recovery is governed by the realignment of collective beliefs. Our work provides a cognitive explanation for this observed persistence of unemployment and the shift of the Beveridge curve.", "authors": [{"name": "Zeqiang Zhang", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Ruxin Chen", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2025, "doi": "10.3390/e27121182", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": "aab11c3bb5e99ba363e97ae4aba16aa8874db3fc", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "Entropy", "citation_count": 0, "references": ["s2:5605f82471df89e934b93f635012777607f369f5", "s2:037c7e80b3eabc0f028c122817acaceada503a6d", "s2:0cabd8d3e3b37af0b114f51e9a75bd5e7d8b5861", "s2:ce9237e6eba70da908096a278e5d5d8abc3299ae", "s2:35aa5ccd7026d122e38adbbd6c7f38d077cb93c3", "s2:03f3b12f5b47b9a61689acbfa1f16e5b0b602d2e", "s2:5a9bf7a4dbf1f116de31d27b31a220306c746f39", "s2:b6e0bdb28cd534f7d1366fbb9a6a7172524ec087", "s2:f98bd85ffa65db6d931d7adcd3d65ebf42400bb1", "s2:bfde3d73c1df8980a0c3915e627236ce818d42c7", "s2:faaa399a082da2631ccd84ca0275920f9c49577c", "s2:1ed6a4a10589618d4f26350f1a296ee767ceff6b", "s2:d19369b1195b4b7e410bd59a687e5d484aa0bdcd", "s2:0b60731438be35c6bcdf543237f07881d6e33ce5", "s2:873e07b18bd9b9e0f33f6181852dd2fbb196a5de", "s2:fbf9bf17b70e5304e124072ad71a2783795bd8e6", "s2:2aec9f0fce66b1727e8f24e59b0b7174506e6553", "s2:625e6da88bcc5d7a75691e417e2aaabffb79a1c8", "s2:db537a5ce6724367676f737bfc539bf7491cf180", "s2:a0fe4333f75d79d71ac37d1a80b5b5a814d73130", "s2:23983dfef4231c3289a5201b0dbc63b525d3f8d8", "s2:97efafdb4a3942ab3efba53ded7413199f79c054"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Bio-Inspired Artificial Neural Networks based on Predictive Coding", "abstract": "Backpropagation (BP) of errors is the backbone training algorithm for artificial neural networks (ANNs). It updates network weights through gradient descent to minimize a loss function representing the mismatch between predictions and desired outputs. BP uses the chain rule to propagate the loss gradient backward through the network hierarchy, allowing efficient weight updates. However, this process requires weight updates at every layer to rely on a global error signal generated at the network's output. In contrast, the Hebbian model of synaptic plasticity states that weight updates are local, depending only on the activity of pre- and post-synaptic neurons. This suggests biological brains likely do not implement BP directly. Recently, Predictive Coding (PC) has gained interest as a biologically plausible alternative that updates weights using only local information. Originating from 1950s work on signal compression, PC was later proposed as a model of the visual cortex and formalized under the free energy principle, linking it to Bayesian inference and dynamical systems. PC weight updates rely solely on local information and provide theoretical advantages such as automatic scaling of gradients based on uncertainty. This lecture notes column offers a novel, tutorial-style introduction to PC, focusing on its formulation, derivation, and connections to well-known optimization and signal processing algorithms such as BP and the Kalman Filter (KF).

{"title": "Self-healing redox chemistry in Cu-TiO2 photocatalysts for enhanced hydrogen production.", "abstract": "Hydrogen production from sunlight and abundant feedstock is central to a sustainable energy future, yet most efficient photocatalysts rely on costly noble metals. Here we report a scalable one-pot synthesis of CuOx-TiO2 photocatalysts that achieve a methanol-assisted hydrogen evolution rate of 30.6 mmol g-1 h-1, among the highest reported for Cu-based systems. The optimized 12% CuOx-TiO2 maintains >90% activity retention over 50 h and performs reproducibly at the gram scale, underscoring its industrial potential. Spectroscopic and computational analyses uncover a dynamic CuO ⇆ Cu2O ⇆ Cu0 cycle and a previously unrecognized corrosion-healing redox loop, in which transient Cu(OH)2 is continuously reduced back to Cu2O by methanol-derived intermediates. This self-healing mechanism stabilizes the active Cu2O phase, suppresses deactivation, and sustains long-term performance. Density functional theory reveals near-optimal hydrogen adsorption free energy (ΔGH* = -0.06 eV) on Cu-TiO2(101), comparable to Pt(111), confirming copper's potential as a low-cost alternative to noble metals.

{"title": "Shape-Dependent Entropic Forces Govern Synergistic Bystander Nanoparticle Uptake.", "abstract": "The rational design of multicomponent nanocarriers for synergistic drug delivery remains a central goal of nanomedicine, yet progress is often hindered by an incomplete understanding of the underlying biophysical principles. Here, we investigate the role of nanoparticle shape in ″bystander uptake″, a process where the active cellular uptake of functionalized nanoparticles (F-NPs) promotes the co-internalization of nonfunctionalized bystander nanoparticles (B-NPs). Combining experiments, simulations, and theory, we demonstrate a nonmonotonic dependence on B-NP geometry, with nanorods of aspect ratio (AR) ≈ 3 exhibiting markedly superior uptake compared to other shapes including the spherical, triangular, or plate-like counterparts. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that this enhancement stems not from greater binding affinity but from shape-dependent entropic force that drives rapid particle reorientation, which is linked to metastable trapping in a ″staircase″ free energy landscape. Crucially, this experimentally observed optimal AR cannot be explained by single-particle models but is successfully predicted by our theoretical framework incorporating the collective action of F-NPs. This model identifies AR ≈ 3 as a ″sweet spot″ that balances entropic advantages against rotational constraints. These findings establish shape selectivity as a principle for multicomponent nanocarrier design, shifting the focus from optimizing enthalpy-modulated end-state affinity to engineering entropy-driven state transitions.", "authors": [{"name": "Yushuang Wei", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Haibo Chen", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Rong Xu", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Zhenyu Zhang", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Xiangyang Li", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Cheng Xu", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Hongbo Pang", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Kai Yang", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Bing Yuan", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2025, "doi": "10.1021/acsnano.5c13968", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": "02727a711e68d53d8d301f5befa4382476ffd699", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "ACS Nano", "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Navigating Uncertainty: Guiding Attention in Purposeful Human Activity Systems", "abstract": "\n Engineering teams are complex socio‐technical systems that design, realise and manage engineered solution systems. However, the tools available to systems engineers to organise and support these teams are not yet as advanced or mature as those used for the systems they engineer. The purposeful human activity systems model (PHAS) was developed to address that gap. This paper proposes extending PHAS by integrating the free‐energy principle (FEP) from computational biology. It introduces a formal model of cognitive agents that navigate, interact with and modify their environment, self‐organising around minimising uncertainty and surprise by actively maintaining predictive models of the world that represent individual and shared worldviews. Minimising uncertainty is the primary driver of attention in this model, highlighting potential leverage points for designing practices and environments that coordinate and guide the focus of engineering teams. Because the model is symmetrical, the environment also models the agent, providing a formal description of affordances and context shaping. The proposed model is used to re‐examine the original PHAS framework, and a case study demonstrates how a small team of engineers used the model to improve their cyber‐security practices.", "authors": [{"name": "R.

{"title": "An Introduction to Predictive Processing Models of Perception and Decision-Making.", "abstract": "The predictive processing framework includes a broad set of ideas, which might be articulated and developed in a variety of ways, concerning how the brain may leverage predictive models when implementing perception, cognition, decision-making, and motor control. This article provides an up-to-date introduction to the two most influential theories within this framework: predictive coding and active inference. The first half of the paper (Sections 2-5) reviews the evolution of predictive coding, from early ideas about efficient coding in the visual system to a more general model encompassing perception, cognition, and motor control. The theory is characterized in terms of the claims it makes at Marr's computational, algorithmic, and implementation levels of description, and the conceptual and mathematical connections between predictive coding, Bayesian inference, and variational free energy (a quantity jointly evaluating model accuracy and complexity) are explored. The second half of the paper (Sections 6-8) turns to recent theories of active inference. Like predictive coding, active inference models assume that perceptual and learning processes minimize variational free energy as a means of approximating Bayesian inference in a biologically plausible manner. However, these models focus primarily on planning and decision-making processes that predictive coding models were not developed to address. Under active inference, an agent evaluates potential plans (action sequences) based on their expected free energy (a quantity that combines anticipated reward and information gain). The agent is assumed to represent the world as a partially observable Markov decision process with discrete time and discrete states. Current research applications of active inference models are described, including a range of simulation work, as well as studies fitting models to empirical data. The paper concludes by considering future research directions that will be important for further development of both models.", "authors": [{"name": "Mark D.

{"title": "Quantum logic automata generalizing the edge of chaos in complex systems", "abstract": "Historically, although researchers in the science of complex systems proposed the idea of the edge of chaos and/or self-organized criticality as the essential feature of complex organization, they were not able to generalize this concept. Complex organization is regarded at the edge of chaos between the order phase and the chaos phase and a very rare case. Additionally, in cellular automata, the critical property is class IV, which is also rarely found. Therefore, there can be overestimation for natural selection. More recently, developments in cognitive and brain science have led to the free energy principle based on Bayesian inference, while quantum cognition has been established to explain various cognitive phenomena. Since Bayesian inference results in the perspective of a steady state, it can be described in Boolean logic. Considering that quantum logic consists of multiple Boolean logic in terms of lattice theory, the perspective of the free energy principle is the perspective of order, and the perspective of quantum logic might be the perspective of multiple worlds, which is strongly relevant for the edge of chaos.The next question arises whether the perspective derived from quantum logic can be generalized for the complex behavior consisting of both order and chaos, instead of the edge of chaos or self-organized criticality, to reveal the property of critical behavior such as a power-law distribution.In this study, we define quantum logic automata, which entail quantum logic (orthomodular lattice) in terms of lattice theory and have the features of a dynamical system. Because quantum logic automata are applied to a binary sequence, one can estimate the behavior of those automata with respect to patterns and a time series. Here, we show that most of a group of quantum logic automata display class IV-like behavior, in which oscillatory traveling waves collide with each other, leading to complex behavior; moreover, a time series of binary sequences displays 1/f noise. Therefore, one can see that quantum logic automata generalize and expand the idea of the edge of chaos.", "authors": [{"name": "Y.

Under active inference, communication can be cast as sharing beliefs between free-energy minimizing agents, where one agent's beliefs get transformed into an observation modality for the other. However, the best approach for transforming beliefs into observations remains an open question. In this paper, we demonstrate that naively sharing posterior beliefs can give rise to the negative social dynamics of echo chambers and self-doubt. We propose an alternate belief sharing strategy which mitigates these issues.", "authors": [{"name": "Ozan Çatal", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Toon Van de Maele", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "R.

{"title": "Sample efficient reinforcement learning with active learning for molecular design", "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful and flexible paradigm for searching for solutions in high-dimensional action spaces. However, bridging the gap between playing computer games with thousands of simulated episodes and solving real scientific problems with complex and involved environments (up to actual laboratory experiments) requires improvements in terms of sample efficiency to make the most of expensive information. The discovery of new drugs is a major commercial application of RL, motivated by the very large nature of the chemical space and the need to perform multiparameter optimization (MPO) across different properties. In silico methods, such as virtual library screening (VS) and de novo molecular generation with RL, show great promise in accelerating this search. However, incorporation of increasingly complex computational models in these workflows requires increasing sample efficiency. Here, we introduce an active learning system linked with an RL model (RL–AL) for molecular design, which aims to improve the sample-efficiency of the optimization process. We identity and characterize unique challenges combining RL and AL, investigate the interplay between the systems, and develop a novel AL approach to solve the MPO problem. Our approach greatly expedites the search for novel solutions relative to baseline-RL for simple ligand- and structure-based oracle functions, with a 5–66-fold increase in hits generated for a fixed oracle budget and a 4–64-fold reduction in computational time to find a specific number of hits. Furthermore, compounds discovered through RL–AL display substantial enrichment of a multi-parameter scoring objective, indicating superior efficacy in curating high-scoring compounds, without a reduction in output diversity.

{"title": "Energy release prediction and structure characterization of nano aluminum powder in situ coated by polyethylene glycol", "abstract": "Abstract In order to solve decreasing of reactivity of nano aluminum powder due to the alumina shell on the surface, used polyethylene glycol (PEG) as a coating material to obtain in situ PEG on nano aluminum particles with electrical explosion wires method. Based on the minimum free energy principle and BKW equation, the combustion and explosion performance of the coated sample is estimated. SEM and TEM to observe sample’s morphology and then used dynamic light scattering (DLS) nano-particle size analyzer to characterize sample’s particle size distribution. The chemical states of surface elements were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The thermal behavior of three samples were characterized by simultaneous thermal analyzer. The combustion heat, pressure-time curve, active Al content and vacuum stability was measured according to national standards. The results show that the coated sample was nearly sphere and particles were deduced multi-core structure. The active Al content reached 71.17% which is 12.53% higher than raw nano-Al particles. It was proved that PEG relieves oxidation of nano-Al, and the coating is stable. The coated samples can release energy more rapidly compared to micro-Al. The PVA in situ coated nano-Al particles has high active Al content and reactivity. Its application in energetic materials has good prospects.", "authors": [{"name": "Wang Hui-xin", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Ren Hui", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Cui Qingzhong", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Y.

{"title": "Dyadic Brain - A Biological Model for Deliberative Inference", "abstract": "The human brain is arguably the most complex information processing system. It operates by acquiring data from the environment, recognizing patterns of events’ occurrence, anticipating their re-occurrence and in turn generating appropriate behavioral responses. Through the lenses of the free-energy principle any self-organizing system that is at equilibrium with its environment must minimize its free energy either by manipulating the environmental sensory input or by manipulating its internal states thus altering the recognition density of the outside stimuli. However, several sets of challenges interfere with the human brain's ability to learn and adapt in such a theoretically optimal fashion. These may include, and are not limited to, functional inconsistencies related to attention and memory processes, the functions of “fast” and “slow” thinking and responding, and the ability of emotional states to generate unintended behavioral outcomes that are less adaptive or inappropriate. This paper will review literature on the subject of how ideal learning viewed from the free-energy principle perspective may be affected by the above mentioned limitations and will suggest a model of information processing that may have developed as a way of overcoming these challenges. This neurobiological model stipulates that a neuronal network is formed in response to environmental input and is paralleled by at least one and possibly multiple networks that activate intrinsically and represent “virtual responses” to a situation that demands a behavioral response. This model accounts for how the brain generates a multiplicity of potential behavioral responses and may “choose” the one that seems most appropriate and also explains the uncanny ability of humans to socialize and collaborate. Implications for understanding humans’ ability to learn from others, deliberate on opposing constructs and access and utilize information outside of individual minds are also discussed.", "authors": [{"name": "I.

{"title": "Statistical mechanics of mean-field disordered systems: a Hamilton-Jacobi approach", "abstract": "The goal of this book is to present new mathematical techniques for studying the behaviour of mean-field systems with disordered interactions. We mostly focus on certain problems of statistical inference in high dimension, and on spin glasses. The techniques we present aim to determine the free energy of these systems, in the limit of large system size, by showing that they asymptotically satisfy a Hamilton-Jacobi equation. The first chapter is a general introduction to statistical mechanics, with a focus on the Curie-Weiss model. We give a brief introduction to convex analysis and large deviation principles in Chapter 2, and identify the limit free energy of the Curie-Weiss model using these tools. In Chapter 3, we define the notion of viscosity solution to a Hamilton-Jacobi equation, and use it to recover the limit free energy of the Curie-Weiss model. We discover technical challenges to applying the same method to generalized versions of the Curie-Weiss model, and develop a new selection principle based on convexity to overcome these. We then turn to statistical inference in Chapter 4, focusing on the problem of recovering a large symmetric rank-one matrix from a noisy observation, and we see that the tools developed in the previous chapter apply to this setting as well. Chapter 5 is preparatory work for a discussion of the more challenging case of spin glasses. The first half of this chapter is a self-contained introduction to Poisson point processes, including limit theorems on extreme values of independent and identically distributed random variables, which we believe to be of independent interest. We finally turn to the setting of spin glasses in Chapter 6. For the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model, we show how to relate the Parisi formula with the Hamilton-Jacobi approach. We conclude with a more informal discussion on the status of current research for more challenging models.", "authors": [{"name": "Tomas Dominguez", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "J.

Inspired by this principle, in this work, we present a one-pot synthesis of ionic hyper-cross-linked polymers (iHCPs) via simultaneous quaternization and Friedel-Crafts alkylation reactions of alkaloids and biphenyl dichloride (BP). These iHCPs exhibited hydrogen bonding capabilities, abundant alkaline and ionic active sites, as well as hierarchically porous structures with ultrahigh surface areas (up to 1480 m2·g-1). The optimized iHCPs, AN-BP(1:3), demonstrated exceptional CO2 adsorption (154.4 mg·g-1 at 273 K and 1 bar) and served as a recyclable catalyst for the solvent-free conversion of CO2 and epoxides into cyclic carbonates without requiring additional cocatalysts. In situ FTIR spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that basic groups enhanced the CO2 adsorption and facilitated chloride ions in promoting the epoxide ring-opening reaction via hydrogen bonding, thereby reducing the relative Gibbs free energy barrier.

{"title": "Feasibility of a Personal Neuromorphic Emulation", "abstract": "The representation of intelligence is achieved by patterns of connections among neurons in brains and machines. Brains grow continuously, such that their patterns of connections develop through activity-dependent specification, with the continuing ontogenesis of individual experience. The theory of active inference proposes that the developmental organization of sentient systems reflects general processes of informatic self-evidencing, through the minimization of free energy. We interpret this theory to imply that the mind may be described in information terms that are not dependent on a specific physical substrate. At a certain level of complexity, self-evidencing of living (self-organizing) information systems becomes hierarchical and reentrant, such that effective consciousness emerges as the consequence of a good regulator.

While traditional reinforcement learning has been widely utilized for resource allocation, it suffers from limitations such as poor generalization and interpretability. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel Intelligence-based Reinforcement Learning (IRL) al-gorithm, which uses active inference to infer the real world and maintain an internal model of the world by minimizing free energy. We address the inefficiency of active inference by incorporating prior knowledge as macro guidance, ensuring more accurate and efficient training. By constructing the intelligence-based model, we eliminate the need for designing reward functions, which aligns better with human thinking and provides a method to reflect the learning, information transmission, and intelligence accumulation processes. Considering the dynamic and uncertain nature of vehicular scenarios, we apply the IRL algorithm to continuously evolving environments where environmental parameters are not fixed. Extensive simulations confirm the effectiveness of IRL, significantly enhancing the generalization and interpretability of intelligent models.", "authors": [{"name": "Yuhang Wang", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Ying He", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "F.

{"title": "Electrochemically Determined, Catalytically Relevant H-Atom Transfer at Metal–Organic Framework-Liquid Interfaces", "abstract": "Proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reaction at the solid-liquid interface is fundamental to energy storage and conversion. Inner-sphere PCET reactions with equimolar amounts of protons and electrons are thermochemically equivalent to H-atom transfer (HAT) reactions; H-atoms bound to the surfaces of electrocatalysts are critical intermediates for reactions of H2, O2, and many others. Thus, the thermodynamics of H-atom binding to the electrocatalyst surface has long been considered the ‘catalytic descriptor’ that scales with the overall activity of these reactions, resulting in a volcano-shaped plot (the Sabatier Principle). These binding energies are computed on defect-free, crystalline surfaces, which minimally represent the complex surface structure of the experimentally employed catalysts. This is particularly pronounced for binary materials where each H-atom binding site can have distinct physical/chemical properties and dynamically evolve during the reaction.\n We describe our recent efforts in electrochemical determination of H-atom binding energy using redox-active, Ti- and Ce-based metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) as model systems. The metal-oxo nodes of these MOFs are structurally well-defined analogs of TiO2 and CeO2, two of the most common metal oxides in heterogeneous catalysis. Using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and open-circuit potential (EOCP) measurements over a wide range of buffers and proton activity, we have successfully quantified the H-atom binding energy on the nodes; we refer to this thermochemical parameter as MO–H bond dissociation free energy (BDFE; M = Ti3+ or Ce3+). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations quantitatively corroborated the experimentally measured BDFE values using crystallographically determined node structures. Using the above approach, we have further extended this approach to lithium-coupled electron transfer (LCET) reactions, given its relevance to energy storage devices. Implications of these results regarding energy-relevant catalysis will be discussed.", "authors": [{"name": "Hyunho Noh", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Nazmiye Gökçe Altınçekiç", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Zachary J.

{"title": "Theoretical investigations of transition metal atom-doped MoSi2N4 monolayers as catalysts for electrochemical CO2 reduction reactions.", "abstract": "Following the principle of single-atom catalysts (SACs), the fourth-period transition metals (TM) were designed as active sites on a MoSi2N4 monolayer surface with N vacancy, and the catalytic mechanisms of these single-atom active sites for the conversion of CO2 to CO were investigated by first-principles calculations. Our results showed that the doped TM atoms on the MoSi2N4 surface significantly enhanced the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) activity compared with the pristine MoSi2N4 monolayer. Our findings after analyzing all the doped structures in our work were as follows: (1) the Sc-, Ti-, and Mn-doped structures exhibited very low limiting potentials; (2) out of Sc-, Ti- and Mn-doped structures, the Mn@MoSi2N4-Nv structure showed the best catalytic performance with a limiting potential of only -0.16 V, exhibiting an advantage over the hydrogen evolution reaction, which is a competitive reaction of CO2RR. However, the positive binding free energy at 298.15 K of the intermediate reactant *COOH on the Mn@MoSi2N4-Nv surface indicated its unstable state, which hinders the CO generation process. This is contrary to the results derived from the adsorption/binding energy at 0 K, which indicated that the effect of temperature cannot be ignored when considering adsorption/binding energy.

{"title": "Formation Mechanism of Ti–Si Multi-Layer Coatings on the Surface of Ti–6Al–4V Alloy", "abstract": "Titanium alloys are widely used in aerospace applications due to their high specific strength and exceptional corrosion resistance. In this study, a silicide coating with a multi-layer structure was designed and prepared via a pack cementation process to improve the high-temperature oxidation resistance of titanium alloy. A new theory based on the Le Chatelier’s principle is proposed to explain the generation mechanism of active Si atoms. Taking the chemical potential as a bridge, a functional model of the relationship between the diffusion driving force and the change in the Gibbs free energy of reaction diffusion is established. Experimental results indicate that the depth of the silicide coating increases with the siliconization temperature (1000–1100 °C) and time (0–5 h). The multi-layer coating prepared at 1075 °C for 3 h exhibits a thick and dense structure with a thickness of 23.52 μm. This coating consists of an outer layer of TiSi2 (9.40 μm), a middle layer of TiSi (3.36 μm), and an inner layer of Ti5Si3 (10.76 μm). Under this preparation parameter, increasing the temperature or prolonging the holding time will cause the outward diffusion flux of atoms in the substrate to be much larger than the diffusion flux of silicon atoms to the substrate, thus forming pores in the coating. The calculated value of the diffusion driving force FTiSi = 2.012S is significantly smaller than that of FTiSi2 = 13.120S and FTi5Si3 = 14.552S, which perfectly reveals the relationship between the thickness of each layer in the Ti–Si multi-layer coating.", "authors": [{"name": "Yu Zhao", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Guodong Liang", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Xinjian Zhang", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Xudong Zhao", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Wensheng Li", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Uladzimir Seniuts", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Zhornik Viktor", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Bo Cheng", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2024, "doi": "10.3390/coatings14040450", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": "57ffd93a3ff97694074d8672ab85151fb49e8020", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "Coatings", "citation_count": 1, "references": ["s2:e1e214cfb5c4c299345a8a72ad310557de7eb3cf", "s2:03e425dd7407d9fd7210046263a2cfe032ad7665", "s2:01c8680d2bf4773f672f11cde9479ce1d2adabb1", "s2:0051b18d95133eac3e68666120e378cf92a7f5aa", "s2:17b90615bb0bf148aac783d0d29ec0d036327af4", "s2:7e93fb47eb20341dc5e6b194a5e53c1a3cc9cc03", "s2:d92fd160fdb2852d8fa1b69ec247d61b8c2a2940", "s2:3c2fe60fc757cb6d639451b9a1a4c355de5434d6", "s2:0f0d8888dd610fe19ddf439ca45781494032eb70", "s2:227b64099f5218fecaea285265e3f4f38e685ffd", "s2:44d0ab578b566419376899bb1b57cc94eccd00f5", "s2:47e4006a6d3e5dd035a02581cb11bc665afdcdf0", "s2:b3679790c62077a6d86e6022122fab404809a4b1", "s2:3e5992cd4564beee2c6d2d3e4cc6d9e36ee38625", "s2:bb563eefca2e82162cdf6a8408dc63e35e81ea14", "s2:5508dd6ceb27051dc6207e732993cb4b6231a7aa", "s2:e5b9c683de79e3209a7c66e9a3f21cfc3af30502", "s2:720b3de6de627745057b3d79d0fca04271b05b4e", "s2:ef59a8eb84ac3c603b03bfc11b19f9564962edf1", "s2:5086d3139e9bc555230a29595acc733165d901ee", "s2:24fc5d00acba82226f399937bbdc63f4592c4543", "s2:5f340a27cd680137cd7f2fe8766629359ab39277", "s2:c52a4491a36f273b801752cd40473eae03838565", "s2:6dc08389630b40f85ae39a7c7b17e517186fcd23", "s2:4ec76a1121c9af47039fde27bdd7f07e21144d57", "s2:316b6bdf341844bbd2e5c252f29cbed44d533bc1", "s2:d67c87cb464d37d6b19a92058746b3a8c13aa024", "s2:867f64459fdc08a247c5b553c334ccf37a5027a7", "s2:1d2a798ae2bf9c2a69b3ec53ac6990f5d8a8bbca", "s2:c88a9c63a7f3438dc41589545482299cde81753d", "s2:d6eb4fe5c6ca18d69e185f7cecd43b0fdb57b2f3", "s2:2f5a49192dc6a624cfcc14ebac2364667f1d7355", "s2:efdc331475ba7934c373ed02e0d51775711ca3fe", "s2:8f0d6719414b1c3910eac2e1a56474cb9bf3ae44", "s2:6ebe35b670a22131e27c4457d7dddebb9fafeade"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Engineering Active Sites of 2D Materials for Active Hydrogen Evolution Reaction", "abstract": "Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is a promising clean and sustainable energy source with zero carbon emissions. Numerous studies have been conducted with versatile low dimensional materials, and the development of highly active electrochemical catalysts for HER is one of the most important applications of the materials in these studies. Despite such extensive research, the physical origin of the active catalytic performance of low dimensional materials remains unclear, and is distinguished from that of classical transition metal‐based catalysts. Here, recent studies on the intrinsic catalytic activity of 2D semimetals are reviewed, particularly among transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), highlighting promising strategies for the design of materials to further enhance their catalytic performance. One attractive approach for active HER involves fabricating single‐atom catalysts in the framework of TMDs. The electrochemical reaction at a catalytic atom for hydrogen evolution has typically been described by the Sabatier principle. Recent studies have focused on optimizing the Gibbs free energy for hydrogen adsorption via down‐sizing, alloying, hybridizing, hetero‐structuring, and phase boundary engineering, mostly with TMDs. The unique advantages of TMDs and their derivatives for HER are summarized, suggesting promising research directions for the design of low dimensional electrochemical catalysts for efficient HER and their energy applications.", "authors": [{"name": "J.

{"title": "Physical origins of entropy production, free energy dissipation, and their mathematical representations.", "abstract": "A unifying mathematical theory of nonequilibrium thermodynamics of stochastic systems in terms of master equations is presented. As generalizations of isothermal entropy and free energy, two functions of state play central roles: the Gibbs entropy S and the relative entropy F , which are related via the stationary distribution of the stochastic dynamics. S satisfies the fundamental entropy balance equation dS/dt = e p - h d/T with entropy production rate e p ≥ 0 and heat dissipation rate h d, while dF/dt = -f d ≤ 0. For closed systems that satisfy detailed balance: Te p(t)=f d(t). For open systems, one has Te p(t) = f d(t)+Q hk(t), where the housekeeping heat, Q hk ≥ 0, was first introduced in the phenomenological nonequilibrium steady-state thermodynamics put forward by Oono and Paniconi. Q hk represents the irreversible work done by the surrounding to the system that is kept away from reaching equilibrium. Hence, entropy production e p consists of free energy dissipation associated with spontaneous relaxation (i.e., self-organization), f d, and active energy pumping that sustains the open system Q hk. The amount of excess heat involved in the relaxation Q ex = h d - Q hk = f d -T(dS/dt). Two kinds of irreversibility, and the meaning of the arrow of time, emerge. Quasistationary processes, adiabaticity, and maximum principle for entropy are also generalized to nonequilibrium settings.", "authors": [{"name": "Hao Ge", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "H.

{"title": "Driving forces in cell migration and pattern formation in a soft tissue", "abstract": "We give a description of cell diffusion in a soft tissue, paying special attention to the coupling of force, matter, and microforce balance laws through a suitable dissipation principle. To this end, we cast our framework into a multi-level schematics, comprising both kinematics and kinetics, based on a characterization of the free energy. We lay down first a force balance law, where force and stress fields are defined as power conjugate quantities to velocity fields and their gradients, then we give a species molar balance law, with chemical potential test fields, as power conjugate quantities to the rate of change of the species concentration, and finally a microforce balance law. The main feature of this framework is the constitutive expression for the chemical potential which is split into a term derived from the homogeneous convex part of the free energy and an active external chemical potential giving rise to the spinodal decomposition. The active part of the chemical potential is given an expression depending on the cell concentration and resembling the one defined in [Oster, Murray and Harris, J. Embryol. Exp. Morph. 78 (1983)], where it is meant to characterize an upward cell diffusion induced by cell motility. Further we show how an external vector field, entering the microforce balance law as a power conjugate quantity to the rate of change of the concentration gradient, can guide the diffusion process to a different limit stationary pattern. This vector field could possibly model any directional cue or bias characterizing the interaction of the migrating cells and the surrounding tissue.", "authors": [{"name": "Amabile Tatone", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "F.

{"title": "Estimating Rank-One Matrices with Mismatched Prior and Noise: Universality and Large Deviations", "abstract": "We prove a universality result that reduces the free energy of rank-one matrix estimation problems in the setting of mismatched prior and noise to the computation of the free energy for a modified Sherrington–Kirkpatrick spin glass. Our main result is an almost sure large deviation principle for the overlaps between the true signal and the estimator for both the Bayes-optimal and mismatched settings. Through the large deviations principle, we recover the limit of the free energy in mismatched inference problems and the universality of the overlaps.", "authors": [{"name": "A.

{"title": "A variational approach to niche construction", "abstract": "In evolutionary biology, niche construction is sometimes described as a genuine evolutionary process whereby organisms, through their activities and regulatory mechanisms, modify their environment such as to steer their own evolutionary trajectory, and that of other species. There is ongoing debate, however, on the extent to which niche construction ought to be considered a bona fide evolutionary force, on a par with natural selection. Recent formulations of the variational free-energy principle as applied to the life sciences describe the properties of living systems, and their selection in evolution, in terms of variational inference. We argue that niche construction can be described using a variational approach.

{"title": "Markov blankets, information geometry and stochastic thermodynamics", "abstract": "This paper considers the relationship between thermodynamics, information and inference. In particular, it explores the thermodynamic concomitants of belief updating, under a variational (free energy) principle for self-organization. In brief, any (weakly mixing) random dynamical system that possesses a Markov blanket—i.e. a separation of internal and external states—is equipped with an information geometry. This means that internal states parametrize a probability density over external states. Furthermore, at non-equilibrium steady-state, the flow of internal states can be construed as a gradient flow on a quantity known in statistics as Bayesian model evidence. In short, there is a natural Bayesian mechanics for any system that possesses a Markov blanket. Crucially, this means that there is an explicit link between the inference performed by internal states and their energetics—as characterized by their stochastic thermodynamics.

{"title": "Oil-on-water droplets faceted and stabilized by vortex halos in the subphase", "abstract": "Significance Oil droplets on water test the principle of surface free energy minimization when volatility or dissolution produce flow-induced viscous shear stresses that take the system out of equilibrium. We find that single droplets adopt polyhedral shapes in shallow water, droplet pairs pulsate in their spacing and shape, multiple oil droplet arrays display active motion, and these droplets are protected from coalescence. Combined experiments, scaling arguments, and linear stability analysis trace these effects to rapid Marangoni flow (“vortex halos”) that shears individual droplets while maintaining them separate from other droplets. The analogy that active emulsion droplets are like an iceberg with submerged halos formed by high-Reynolds-number flow thus presents an approach to control and manipulate this common system.", "authors": [{"name": "Yitan Li", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "A.

{"title": "Molecular dynamics derived life times of active substrate binding poses explain KM of laccase mutants", "abstract": "Fungal laccases (EC 1.10.3.2) are important multi-copper oxidases with broad substrate specificity. Laccases from Trametes versicolor (TvL) are among the best-characterized of these enzymes. Mutations in the substrate-binding site of TvL substantially affect KM, but a molecular understanding of this effect is missing. We explored the effect of TvL mutations on KM for the standard laccase substrate 2,6-dimethoxyphenol using 4500 ns of molecular dynamics, docking, and MMGBSA free energy computations. We show that changes in KM due to mutation consistently correlate with the dynamics of the substrates within the substrate-binding site. We find that KM depends on the lifetime (“dynamic stability”) of the enzyme-substrate complex as commonly assumed. We then further show that MMGBSA-derived free energies of substrate binding in the active pose consistently reproduce large vs. small experimental KM values. Our results indicate that hydrophobic packing of the substrate near the T1 binding site of the laccase is instrumental for high turnover via KM. We also address the more general question of how enzymes such as laccases gain advantage of lower KM despite the Sabatier principle, which disfavors a stable enzyme–substrate complex. Our data suggest that the observed KM relates directly to the lifetime of the active substrate pose within a protein. In contrast, the thermochemical stability of the enzyme–substrate complex reflects an ensemble average of all enzyme–substrate binding poses. This distinction may explain how enzymes work by favoring longer residence time in the active pose without too favorable general enzyme–substrate interactions, a principle that may aid the rational design of enzymes.", "authors": [{"name": "Rukmankesh Mehra", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "A.

{"title": "HPMCAS-Based Amorphous Solid Dispersions in Clinic: A Review on Manufacturing Techniques (Hot Melt Extrusion and Spray Drying), Marketed Products and Patents", "abstract": "Today, therapeutic candidates with low solubility have become increasingly common in pharmaceutical research pipelines. Several techniques such as hot melt extrusion, spray drying, supercritical fluid technology, electrospinning, KinetiSol, etc., have been devised to improve either or both the solubility and dissolution to enhance the bioavailability of these active substances belonging to BCS Class II and IV. The principle involved in all these preparation techniques is similar, where the crystal lattice of the drug is disrupted by either the application of heat or dissolving it in a solvent and the movement of the fine drug particles is arrested with the help of a polymer by either cooling or drying to remove the solvent. The dispersed drug particles in the polymer matrix have higher entropy and enthalpy and, thereby, higher free energy in comparison to the crystalline drug. Povidone, polymethaacrylate derivatives, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate derivatives are commonly used as polymers in the preparation of ASDs. Specifically, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose acetate succinate (HPMCAS)-based ASDs have become well established in commercially available products and are widely explored to improve the solubility of poorly soluble drugs. This article provides an analysis of two widely used manufacturing techniques for HPMCAS ASDs, namely, hot melt extrusion and spray drying. Additionally, details of HPMCAS-based ASD marketed products and patents have been discussed to emphasize the commercial aspect.", "authors": [{"name": "L.

{"title": "Nucleophilic deposition behavior of metal anodes.", "abstract": "Nucleophilic materials play important roles in the deposition behavior of high-energy-density metal batteries (Li, Na, K, Zn, and Ca), while the principle and determination method of nucleophilicity are lacking. In this review, we summarize the metal extraction/deposition process to find out the mechanism of nucleophilic deposition behavior. The key points of the most critical nucleophilic behavior were found by combining the potential change, thermodynamic analysis, and active metal deposition behavior. On this basis, the inductivity and affinity of the material have been determined by Gibbs free energy directly. Thus, the inducibility of most materials has been classified: (a) induced nuclei can reduce the overpotential of active metals; (b) not all materials can induce active metal deposition; (c) the induced reaction is not changeless. Based on these results, the influencing factors (temperature, mass, phase state, induced reaction product, and alloying reactions) were also taken into account during the choice of inducers for active metal deposition. Finally, the critical issues, challenges, and perspectives for further development of high-utilization metal electrodes were considered comprehensively.", "authors": [{"name": "Yuqian Li", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Jie Shu", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Liyuan Zhang", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2023, "doi": "10.1039/d3mh00235g", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": "834e73d550bb7fd8f5c2dd4cdb11829812b2c1ce", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "Materials Horizons", "citation_count": 10, "references": [], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Stochastic Control Liaisons: Richard Sinkhorn Meets Gaspard Monge on a Schrödinger Bridge", "abstract": "In 1931--1932, Erwin Schr\\\"odinger studied a hot gas Gedankenexperiment (an instance of large deviations of the empirical distribution). Schr\\\"odinger's problem represents an early example of a fundamental inference method, the so-called maximum entropy method, having roots in Boltzmann's work and being developed in subsequent years by Jaynes, Burg, Dempster, and Csisz\\'ar. The problem, known as the Schr\\\" odinger bridge problem (SBP) with ``uniform\"\" prior, was more recently recognized as a regularization of the Monge-Kantorovich optimal mass transport (OMT) problem, leading to effective computational schemes for the latter. Specifically, OMT with quadratic cost may be viewed as a zerotemperature limit of the problem posed by Schr\\\"odinger in the early 1930s. The latter amounts to minimization of Helmholtz's free energy over probability distributions that are constrained to possess two given marginals. The problem features a delicate compromise, mediated by a temperature parameter, between minimizing the internal energy and maximizing the entropy. These concepts are central to a rapidly expanding area of modern science dealing with the so-called Sinkhorn algorithm, which appears as a special case of an algorithm first studied in the more challenging continuous space setting by the French analyst Robert Fortet in 1938--1940 specifically for Schr\\\"odinger bridges. Due to the constraint on end-point distributions, dynamic programming is not a suitable tool to attack these problems. Instead, Fortet's iterative algorithm and its discrete counterpart, the Sinkhorn iteration, permit computation of the optimal solution by iteratively solving the so-called Schr\\\" odinger system. Convergence of the iteration is guaranteed by contraction along the steps in suitable metrics, such as Hilbert's projective metric. In both the continuous as well as the discrete time and space settings, stochastic control provides a reformulation of and a context for the dynamic versions of general Schr\\\" odinger bridge problems and of their zero-temperature limit, the OMT problem. These problems, in turn, naturally lead to steering problems for flows of one-time marginals which represent a new paradigm for controlling uncertainty. The zero-temperature problem in the continuous-time and space setting turns out to be the celebrated Benamou--Brenier characterization of theMcCann displacement interpolation flow in OMT. The formalism and techniques behind these control problems on flows of probability distributions have attracted significant attention in recent years as they lead to a variety of new applications in spacecraft guidance, control of robot or biological swarms, sensing, active cooling, and network routing as well as in computer and data science.

{"title": "Active Fovea-Based Vision Through Computationally-Effective Model-Based Prediction", "abstract": "What motivates an action in the absence of a definite reward? Taking the case of visuomotor control, we consider a minimal control problem that is how select the next saccade, in a sequence of discrete eye movements, when the final objective is to better interpret the current visual scene. The visual scene is modeled here as a partially-observed environment, with a generative model explaining how the visual data is shaped by action. This allows to interpret different action selection metrics proposed in the literature, including the Salience, the Infomax and the Variational Free Energy, under a single information theoretic construct, namely the view-based Information Gain. Pursuing this analytic track, two original action selection metrics named the Information Gain Lower Bound (IGLB) and the Information Gain Upper Bound (IGUB) are then proposed. Showing either a conservative or an optimistic bias regarding the Information Gain, they strongly simplify its calculation. An original fovea-based visual scene decoding setup is then proposed, with numerical experiments highlighting different facets of artificial fovea-based vision. A first and principal result is that state-of-the-art recognition rates are obtained with fovea-based saccadic exploration, using less than 10% of the original image's data. Those satisfactory results illustrate the advantage of mixing predictive control with accurate state-of-the-art predictors, namely a deep neural network. A second result is the sub-optimality of some classical action-selection metrics widely used in the literature, that is not manifest with finely-tuned inference models, but becomes patent when coarse or faulty models are used. Last, a computationally-effective predictive model is developed using the IGLB objective, with pre-processed visual scan-path read-out from memory, bypassing computationally-demanding predictive calculations. This last simplified setting is shown effective in our case, showing both a competing accuracy and a good robustness to model flaws.", "authors": [{"name": "Emmanuel Daucé", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2018, "doi": "10.3389/fnbot.2018.00076", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": "942510c691c04be195174d176565a83d402d00e1", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "Front.

{"title": "Minimum-Action Method for Nonequilibrium Phase Transitions", "abstract": "First-order nonequilibrium phase transitions observed in active matter, fluid dynamics, biology, climate science, and other systems with irreversible dynamics are challenging to analyze because they cannot be inferred from a simple free energy minimization principle. Rather the mechanism of these transitions depends crucially on the system's dynamics, which requires us to analyze them in trajectory space rather than in phase space. Here we consider situations where the path of these transitions can be characterized as the minimizer of an action, whose minimum value can be used in a nonequilibrium generalization of the Arrhenius law to calculate the system's phase diagram. We also develop efficient numerical tools for the minimization of this action. These tools are general enough to be transportable to many situations of interest, in particular when the fluctuations present in the microscopic system are non-Gaussian and its dynamics is not governed by the standard Langevin equation. As an illustration, first-order phase transitions in two spatially-extended nonequilibrium systems are analyzed: a modified Ginzburg-Landau equation with a chemical potential which is non-gradient, and a reaction-diffusion network based on the Schl\\\"ogl model. The phase diagrams of both systems are calculated as a function of their control parameters, and the paths of the transitions, including their critical nuclei, are identified.

{"title": "Stochastic dynamics from maximum entropy in action space", "abstract": "We develop an information-theoretic formulation of stochastic dynamics in which the fundamental stochastic variable is the total action connecting spacetime points, rather than individual paths. By maximizing Shannon entropy over a joint distribution of actions and endpoints, subject to normalization and a constraint on the mean action, we obtain a Boltzmann-like distribution in action space. This framework reproduces the standard Brownian propagator in the nonrelativistic limit and naturally extends to relativistic regimes, where the Wiener construction fails to preserve Lorentz covariance. The approach bypasses functional integration over paths, makes the role of entropic degeneracy explicit through an action-space density of states, and provides a transparent connection between the principle of least action and statistical inference. We derive the density of states explicitly using large deviation theory, showing that it takes a Gaussian form centered at the minimal action, and rigorously justify the saddle-point approximation in the diffusive regime. The Markovian property of the resulting propagator is verified to hold via the Chapman--Kolmogorov equation, following from the additivity of the minimal action for free-particle dynamics. In the diffusive regime, the resulting dynamics are governed by a competition between extremization of the action and entropic effects, which can be interpreted in terms of an effective action free energy. Our results establish an unified, covariant, and information-based foundation for classical and relativistic stochastic processes.", "authors": [{"name": "Fabricio de Souza Luiz", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Jos'e Carlos Bellizotti Souza", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "L.

{"title": "Exposure to false cardiac feedback alters pain perception and anticipatory cardiac frequency", "abstract": "The experience of pain, like other interoceptive processes, has recently been conceptualized in terms of predictive coding and free energy frameworks. In these views, the brain integrates sensory, proprioceptive, and interoceptive signals to generate probabilistic inferences about upcoming events, which shape both the state and the perception of our inner body. Here we ask whether it is possible to induce pain expectations by providing false faster (vs. slower) acoustic cardiac feedback before administering electrical cutaneous shocks. We test whether these expectations will shape both the perception of pain and the body’s physiological state toward prior predictions. Results confirmed that faster cardiac feedback elicited pain expectations that affected both perceptual pain judgments and the body’s physiological response. Perceptual pain judgments were biased towards the expected level of pain, such that participants illusorily perceived identical noxious stimuli as more intense and unpleasant. Physiological changes mirrored the predicted level of pain, such that participants’ actual cardiac response in anticipation of pain stimuli showed a deceleration in heart rate, in line with the well-known orienting cardiac response in anticipation of threatening stimuli (Experiment 1). In a control experiment, such perceptual and cardiac modulations were dramatically reduced when the feedback reproduced an exteroceptive, instead of interoceptive, cardiac feedback (Experiment 2). These findings show that cardiac perception can be understood as interoceptive inference that modulates both our perception and the physiological state of the body, thereby actively generating the interoceptive and autonomic consequences that have been predicted.", "authors": [{"name": "Eleonora Parrotta", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Patric Bach", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "G.

{"title": "Topological potentials guiding protein self-assembly", "abstract": "The simulated self-assembly of molecular building blocks into functional complexes is a key area of study in computational biology and materials science. Self-assembly simulations of proteins using physically-motivated potentials for non-polar interactions, can identify the biologically correct assembly as the energy-minimizing state. Short-range potentials, however, produce rugged energy landscapes, which lead to simulations becoming trapped in non-functional local minimizers. Successful self-assembly simulations depend on the physical realism of the driving potentials as well as their ability to efficiently explore the configuration space. We introduce a long-range topological potential, quantified via weighted total persistence, and combine it with the morphometric approach to solvation-free energy. This combination improves the assembly success rate in simulations of the tobacco mosaic virus dimer and other protein complexes by up to sixteen-fold compared with the morphometric model alone. It further enables successful simulation in systems that don't otherwise assemble during the examined timescales. Compared to previous topology-based work, which has been primarily descriptive, our approach uses topological measures as an active energetic bias that is independent of electrostatics or chemical specificity and depends only on atomic coordinates. Therefore, the method can, in principle, be applied to arbitrary systems where such coordinates are optimized. Integrating topological descriptions into an energy function offers a general strategy for overcoming kinetic barriers in molecular simulations, with potential applications in drug design, materials development, and the study of complex self-assembly processes.", "authors": [{"name": "Ivan Spirandelli", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Arnur Nigmetov", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Dmitriy Morozov", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "M.

{"title": "The anatomy of choice: dopamine and decision-making", "abstract": "This paper considers goal-directed decision-making in terms of embodied or active inference. We associate bounded rationality with approximate Bayesian inference that optimizes a free energy bound on model evidence. Several constructs such as expected utility, exploration or novelty bonuses, softmax choice rules and optimism bias emerge as natural consequences of free energy minimization. Previous accounts of active inference have focused on predictive coding. In this paper, we consider variational Bayes as a scheme that the brain might use for approximate Bayesian inference. This scheme provides formal constraints on the computational anatomy of inference and action, which appear to be remarkably consistent with neuroanatomy. Active inference contextualizes optimal decision theory within embodied inference, where goals become prior beliefs. For example, expected utility theory emerges as a special case of free energy minimization, where the sensitivity or inverse temperature (associated with softmax functions and quantal response equilibria) has a unique and Bayes-optimal solution. Crucially, this sensitivity corresponds to the precision of beliefs about behaviour. The changes in precision during variational updates are remarkably reminiscent of empirical dopaminergic responses—and they may provide a new perspective on the role of dopamine in assimilating reward prediction errors to optimize decision-making.", "authors": [{"name": "Karl J.

{"title": "Noble Metal Single-Atom Coordinated to Nitrogen, Oxygen, and Carbon as Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Evolution", "abstract": "Tuning the coordination environment centering metal atoms has been regarded as a promising strategy to promote the activities of noble metal single-atom catalysts (SACs). In the present work, first-principle calculations are employed to explore the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of Ir and Ru SACs with chemical coordination being nitrogen (M-N4-C), oxygen (M-O4-C), and carbon (M-C4-C) in graphene, respectively. A “three-step” strategy was implemented by progressively investigating these metrics (stability, catalytic activity, structure–activity relationship). A volcano plot of reactivity is established by using the adsorption-free energy of O* (∆GO*) as a theoretical descriptor. The intrinsic OER activity is IrN4-C > IrO4-C > RuO4-C > RuN4-C > IrC4-C > RuC4-C. The in-depth tuning mechanism of ∆GO* can be indicated and interpreted by the d-band centers of the active sites and the crystal orbital Hamilton population analysis of metal-oxygen bonds, respectively.", "authors": [{"name": "Jianhua Wang", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Jiangdong Bai", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Yaqi Cang", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Qing Li", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Xing Fan", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Haiping Lin", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2023, "doi": "10.3390/catal13101378", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": "8623fc103384c73416794b0f7a6002c31c3aabc8", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "Catalysts", "citation_count": 5, "references": ["s2:4d016a27dbc5aaeb19f9e3c37f5ae03b33c59171", "s2:5d8dcc9d69b13fcda29b3f03096957bab36dcd65", "s2:b51033de54ba519225f84acac449a206020fe5c5", "s2:16c803451f022d21d293160f4331c392ba566af0", "s2:ac667e87e1d9932c0b7ba401d5abd2d018a3698f", "s2:ddb5152ef3b9f354c22a3984879601bd2317536b", "s2:40da943afeaba0da5173c495274660a39eb2a576", "s2:01f76a138f19e0d298141d969b75de9fd9b25eca", "s2:c6adb86edda31ea3e71e568be97f514cfddf6e40", "s2:067bf0cff3215e1b4d62365c77c791c5b9ad8930", "s2:8a55bb5c765d7610b816ccf3799e4e6bc67353c4", "s2:e7c15c1b1e43ffb509b4659cc858184fd0297791", "s2:40d273a260a65341e51015113f399218526c572f", "s2:d8ee4279a3cc845df00e7d63b60afa56ddfd8935", "s2:e833c146bb1815eb20c730664cb003de7fa59479", "s2:d7d9de79ce87dc0640abf0c5d12410b258eae611", "s2:2f9863c09a3d9c9ba6a26b5ae0fe2da54c9468f4", "s2:3557ca7aed0006514e540ec1a79f20f795d12db7", "s2:5a121cf2a617ddceecd87d2f66acaad0dab73bae", "s2:1c7b0d6249d6e000c90e9518fb589793f26539b4", "s2:021da2d247de68d92794d582b9f968fff1790890", "s2:6eeb67acac54cf87a1c28059ff6863f5ace85a18", "s2:af1f4bcd83f3a3f4410de5b8086dfc88cfad542c", "s2:af1f25bcfa94f48e00403e8578d74c0b4290af76", "s2:db79f4919e20d5343fae89b3b08c4dc14a807ca5", "s2:68a0f0bad37a8d14c2d8ee0d5f0eca6ec742aee2", "s2:100f50eba3ec232bd86d69937bbdf229d85c1a6c", "s2:56fe9e678160735e058061d40f9d3e351a7f7900", "s2:0818d00029dafe31b0dce4db7c85faf268582019", "s2:2e5d68eb6b5f45f9666a2dad9aeb223e53a5c440", "s2:da1fea71797e3d8095f5642d9f3382ac2b01b111", "s2:976fd7541527116c7c04270e8377af7236a0361b", "s2:1fb72138b3847b4d23e783a97c538fe48ed4183d", "s2:bcc90fc048e0c20c177a7c4d7ab81e084e3f5853", "s2:70648a41ccb3b71e4a3b120e9064a77f38e6945e", "s2:6a3f5f6cd14a9616d5c61cc09ea2f7e199049a79", "s2:5f56acfe7d3098988320c6523023af4c898577e2", "s2:b3e5c96260929feb3ccf1dd7e141b8cd57f23618", "s2:ec954a1547b6ef8224bc4dca24aa64c55383d428", "s2:c3f843709bd2f5f7e71f04cdb88b9e91d6dd837f", "s2:1c1d6317c902c214309b683879e7d9c5c75b18c6", "s2:6670166ae2aeda2cfe0161e586fdf407c5c27277", "s2:93a912884a762745fb4a98fee38b5f85b289f689", "s2:297018adb8533053646581f74862711c8586e3cc", "s2:8d1c822fedbeb7430f4d0e8accacc8bcb0526f09", "s2:b38751de2c3a802e4dd5d23829c6cf0f7d90783f", "s2:6ec7b82cf8dec03d83032f87cd483061df39098b", "s2:70afa53b98b2d52a18808250153883675792a9d3", "s2:809d85c61fe894d6d19fdb02e99a21db5faa8c52", "s2:4aaacd8e18d30956e91e3b15e68d139cc17ec94e", "s2:bf312403f127aa58d3785e2c0cedbd771861d228", "s2:b87722638ac0afc286b223c69d725175e1ca0314", "s2:12d1bcd4f2e69d94811c4bda93f876a06774c5a9", "s2:0c183a712c41e34ad391776fbdf6d9616df17360", "s2:6316c3eac036defb65a172bd9a7b150a56b69895", "s2:ed73eb5b0fcb517d1e13feaa1e09be163e7f7cde", "s2:bad1be638b556812f6a08b277c0fa2d2e92d5e96", "s2:f955afd60c193275b8b45b351840dd8c9c3596ec", "s2:4e65bee56490fdc3dff46cf331aa693d7c85937d", "s2:bec402e6f41f2e5e0b27b3a7642ad92d10cc2fdc", "s2:0124e103fc8e85919523df06a8d3e8fc3043ae6b", "s2:eb4a6bfb74a9af6d158fa48f511048a95ddfe6ef", "s2:a6214b90410f1a53015da3c70cb493bfd4b9307f", "s2:8dd054a91a96f960f8e93e7dee814d4846472e01"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Life as Non-Normal Chemical Accelerator", "abstract": "Life is commonly described as a self-organized, far-from-equilibrium process that maintains internal order by consuming free energy and exporting entropy. This thermodynamic view underlies diverse theoretical frameworks -- from autopoiesis and relational biology to autocatalytic sets and hypercycles -- yet dissipation is typically treated as a necessary consequence of living organization rather than as a property shaped by its internal dynamics. Here, through explicit calculations of biotic chemical reactions and empirical documentation, we show that living systems universally function as non-normal chemical accelerators. Their elevated entropy production emerges from the asymmetric and hierarchical architecture of their biochemical networks. We introduce a general conceptual and mathematical framework in which biological structuration is understood as a dynamical property. Characterized by asymmetric couplings and transient amplification despite asymptotic stability, non-normal dynamics are shown to naturally generate kinetic acceleration, enhanced energy throughput, and phase-transition-like reorganizations without classical bifurcations. In this view, biological organization is not merely compatible with dissipation but actively structured to amplify free-energy flux and entropy export. We support this perspective with empirical and theoretical evidence that biochemical networks generically give rise to intrinsically non-normal operators through non-reciprocal interactions and hierarchical design. This framework yields testable predictions for dissipation rates, robustness, and evolutionary design principles, and suggests a kinetic principle of evolution in which living systems preferentially construct increasingly non-normal reaction architectures, driving sustained amplification of chemical fluxes and entropy flow.", "authors": [{"name": "Didier Sornette", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Virgile Troude", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2025, "doi": null, "arxiv_id": "2512.18438", "s2_id": "f3647b1bcaed8013f6b9a6c9911cf71cfbb23ff3", "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": ["s2:9ccdf067a932c9f89f426626f88fb0856ff23507", "s2:021fa685afeb8d9a5e4ff74b4ac81629246ad591", "s2:00a89c0af986aa3a104d6663cc3e57432d0212bd", "s2:b460c286ded095ab9eb4b7d16ac9a9b55980776d", "s2:89dedb0c91c4bb7669aba976c627451adc3d1112", "s2:1374663bc6f9497c96a10fd7a36db2f4bcf36c1e", "s2:1e997e973da906e9b7d205458225ba54fc4fe12b", "s2:aebd6e84ed8e4c4cddfa4951e1d9c9f8b5ccc9a0", "s2:af7c0c94ffaa1632638d365c49142ff4564703ee", "s2:3e63b2581427ccc04b28b758a1000796a92c1cbb", "s2:54e5054a9c8768fa4003551db9dd0c6ecade7aa7", "s2:d5a4f95d85b5af81f41be54846cc004a9fc5b939", "s2:e5e24b90edeec275f0c51ed080d92514d89ca55d", "s2:93b7f5cff518421ae153bafe1bef271641afeed1", "s2:7d88d442df491da170eb44c4c5e8ae7937759cff", "s2:f722d6632851ee09461858b457fef716ea765421", "s2:328f4f32498eceeb3ffc1b1bb59fd66f197550f2", "s2:22894532e875ee505bb13756b8ee2bc91b7fb57c", "s2:89ab25993c385517ec67b260336932f023392427", "s2:35f2366a9ab89ee03d9ec34619c9ce084d236a61", "s2:53e9bd4a624a124a4b4bade4b271fc367a65776c", "s2:1088cccd12c125d1e16fe9c85fdbb49fa4ce85d9", "s2:3fbdadc2f05ba9532b80a97ba0bfbc98f080338e", "s2:2bed6769fc3ddd058b244d1b7ecc69cb74d055fa", "s2:46918510ba293f67d4560c459ce1476d7f4290f4", "s2:cf7e33d282b4b1f50efe81f8af32a7c1750b0ad1", "s2:79648e7d317f421cf5d256908c5ccc90e61b4e1b", "s2:83e8bd59fa424d6bec99830349cd1344aaffee13", "s2:a4fdd32c120c2e3fc2b335203e674a0198f25f7d", "s2:b1b773205a04de0e0c3adf130eec9cfa315bc0e8", "s2:7f425ea46a01bf3363a6fbb057cb094051aa266c", "s2:1ed6a4a10589618d4f26350f1a296ee767ceff6b", "s2:18d2248ea7d41b715f105eb214c28ef9a74613e9", "s2:ccfe50ba82fe0b46a004bc5c18fa760a05461aa8", "s2:11995f7bc0e2a595b77f1b6cb3d026cc6123a8c6", "s2:f57819360c6e00d0ebf0a3d2d41ff79c2bf14d80", "s2:2e0794a107fe729370484701d28829eae2ca9494", "s2:7e8a89a540b52574f11c9511a1f62ece22693809", "s2:abe992f310e562aac2f362d2b4199f2ac1182cc3", "s2:9a7e4e791687a00827b164f514fcdffb49c70dad", "s2:645f680451cfb7741c71f8c218e7ebe788412535", "s2:dad9e68a740bfbe2935a56850be34a7d2598ca0b", "s2:e91d7d28630a69522607cbbdedc2ffafaf418448", "s2:3ac696932521fed70e43bec8408e4a0df32d3c57", "s2:69de00b42539b0c0077830f36733dd71c8eb8662", "s2:25217f042978a43a95d9de876b148a7cc3e2d2c2", "s2:a9f11102afcfbef68b4bd1ddefd5e29236283b0a", "s2:268dc1a7c6706323b48cf2831b94301df3b0b4f6", "s2:e4275cc7fbeefff1e0e2793f4a49cb7f72e304f8", "s2:0b25fbd00a1dba3844cc0df996fdbdd587e21883", "s2:af094fc0b78097f4d59b17d34235732179c0fd63", "s2:8c52d5b3b2938ae52cfca1bd2c6053fe711f27de", "s2:9fcd8ac47bd194571d57fe59477fed9e3d5ebff0", "s2:eefb7127bbf856e30ef16980d01297b830d3c2d5", "s2:ee8317955dae5906e74940271daddfd46f3383bb", "s2:a2c6ad7e8bb95240e31f95cba08ba78f6a9ba0c1", "s2:aabd68f66ec8daa5e98145494bb2421833f6e8ff", "s2:2414141a753c42943fa1c5cc0971588c466df30a", "s2:0e647a17f8826570688895082ed0309e9bbe26cd", "s2:e1cb061c8562a41c53432e7f2ccea88d96c97ca1", "s2:55bce38890882b2d95c47755534696f2ccd0f1c5", "s2:0ec43db4db4a44a9453fd09997870e202ab0e512", "s2:2f6f67900417c03b35db0f7ea19995fa7fea9cad", "s2:cb044364d5ca44e63c79cf91cd997a83e52a3d20", "s2:84e4706799a69f036026790bd6d84178a2e67552", "s2:de39028ea1122d09649a42b12e04c8f349ebe8a6"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "The Projective Consciousness Model and Phenomenal Selfhood", "abstract": "We summarize our recently introduced Projective Consciousness Model (PCM) (Rudrauf et al., 2017) and relate it to outstanding conceptual issues in the theory of consciousness. The PCM combines a projective geometrical model of the perspectival phenomenological structure of the field of consciousness with a variational Free Energy minimization model of active inference, yielding an account of the cybernetic function of consciousness, viz., the modulation of the field’s cognitive and affective dynamics for the effective control of embodied agents. The geometrical and active inference components are linked via the concept of projective transformation, which is crucial to understanding how conscious organisms integrate perception, emotion, memory, reasoning, and perspectival imagination in order to control behavior, enhance resilience, and optimize preference satisfaction. The PCM makes substantive empirical predictions and fits well into a (neuro)computationalist framework. It also helps us to account for aspects of subjective character that are sometimes ignored or conflated: pre-reflective self-consciousness, the first-person point of view, the sense of minenness or ownership, and social self-consciousness. We argue that the PCM, though still in development, offers us the most complete theory to date of what Thomas Metzinger has called “phenomenal selfhood.”", "authors": [{"name": "K.

{"title": "Cerebellar state estimation enables resilient coupling across behavioural domains", "abstract": "Cerebellar computations are necessary for fine behavioural control and are thought to rely on internal probabilistic models performing state estimation. We propose that the cerebellum infers how states contextualise (i.e., interact with) each other, and coordinates extra-cerebellar neuronal dynamics underpinning a range of behaviours. To support this claim, we describe a cerebellar model for state estimation that includes states interactions, and link the underlying inference with the neuronal architecture and dynamics observed empirically. This is formalised using the free energy principle, which provides a dual perspective on a system in terms of both the dynamics of its physical – in this case neuronal – states, and the inference process they entail. As a proof of principle, we simulate cerebellar-dependent synchronisation of whisking and respiration, which are known to be tightly coupled in rodents. In summary, we suggest that cerebellar-dependent contextualisation of behaviour can explain its ubiquitous involvement in most aspects of behaviour.", "authors": [{"name": "E.

{"title": "Statistical Inference for Ergodic Algorithmic Model (EAM), Applied to Hydrophobic Hydration Processes", "abstract": "The thermodynamic properties of hydrophobic hydration processes can be represented in probability space by a Dual-Structure Partition Function {DS-PF} = {M-PF} · {T-PF}, which is the product of a Motive Partition Function {M-PF} multiplied by a Thermal Partition Function {T-PF}. By development of {DS-PF}, parabolic binding potential functions α) RlnKdual = (−ΔG°dual/T) ={f(1/T)*g(T)} and β) RTlnKdual = (−ΔG°dual) = {f(T)*g(lnT)} have been calculated. The resulting binding functions are “convoluted” functions dependent on the reciprocal interactions between the primary function f(1/T) or f(T) with the secondary function g(T) or g(lnT), respectively. The binding potential functions carry the essential thermodynamic information elements of each system. The analysis of the binding potential functions experimentally determined at different temperatures by means of the Thermal Equivalent Dilution (TED) principle has made possible the evaluation, for each compound, of the pseudo-stoichiometric coefficient ±ξw, from the curvature of the binding potential functions. The positive value indicates convex binding functions (Class A), whereas the negative value indicates concave binding function (Class B). All the information elements concern sets of compounds that are very different from one set to another, in molecular dimension, in chemical function, and in aggregation state. Notwithstanding the differences between, surprising equal unitary values of niche (cavity) formation in Class A A = −22.7 ± 0.7 kJ·mol−1 ·ξw−1 sets with standard deviation σ = ±3.1% and A = −445 ± 3J·K−1·mol−1·ξw−1J·K−1·mol−1·ξw−1 with standard deviation σ = ±0.7%. Other surprising similarities have been found, demonstrating that all the data analyzed belong to the same normal statistical population. The Ergodic Algorithmic Model (EAM) has been applied to the analysis of important classes of reactions, such as thermal and chemical denaturation, denaturation of proteins, iceberg formation or reduction, hydrophobic bonding, and null thermal free energy. The statistical analysis of errors has shown that EAM has a general validity, well beyond the limits of our experiments. Specifically, the properties of hydrophobic hydration processes as biphasic systems generating convoluted binding potential functions, with water as the implicit solvent, hold for all biochemical and biological solutions, on the ground that they also are necessarily diluted solutions, statistically validated.", "authors": [{"name": "E.

{"title": "Critical Factors Affecting the Catalytic Activity of Redox Mediators on Li-O2 Battery Discharge.", "abstract": "Redox mediators (RMs) have a substantial ability to govern oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in Li-O2 batteries, which can realize large capacity and high-rate capability. However, studies on understanding RM-assisted ORR mechanisms are still in their infancy. Herein, a quinone-based molecule, vitamin K1 (VK1), is first used as the ORR RM for Li-O2 batteries, together with 2,5-di-tert-butyl-1,4-benzoquinone (DBBQ), to elucidate key factors on the catalytic activity of RMs. By combining experiments and first-principle computations, we demonstrate that the reduced VK1 has strong oxygen affinity and can effectively retard the deposition of Li2O2 films on the electrode surface, thereby guaranteeing enough active sites for electron transfer. Besides, the low reaction free energy of disproportionation of the Li(VK1)O2 intermediate into Li2O2 also significantly accelerates the ORR process. Consequently, the catalytic activity of VK1 is significantly boosted, and the discharge capacity of VK1-assisted batteries is 3.2-4.5 times that of DBBQ-assisted batteries. This study provides new insight for better understanding the working roles of RMs in Li-O2 batteries.", "authors": [{"name": "Yaying Dou", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Dongxiao Kan", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Yuwei Su", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Yantao Zhang", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Yingjin Wei", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Zhang Zhang", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Zhen Zhou", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2022, "doi": "10.1021/acs.jpclett.2c01818", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": "544911831a755a224a7f81ddb613458b98c42aa6", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters", "citation_count": 21, "references": [], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Optimal Geometrical Configuration of Cobalt Cations in Spinel Oxides to Promote Oxygen Evolution Reaction.", "abstract": "Modulating coordination environment and electronic structure of metal cations in electrocatalysts can enhance efficiently their activities. Distinguishing optimal geometrical configuration of cobalt cations in spinel oxides for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) will be of great significance for designing efficient OER electrocatalysts. Herein, we select MgCo2O4, CoCr2O4 and Co2TiO4, where only Co3+ in the center of octahedron (Oh), Co2+ in the center of tetrahedron (Td) and Co2+ in the center of Oh, respectively, can be active sites for OER as model electrocatalysts. The electrochemical results demonstrate Co3+(Oh) sites are the best geometrical configuration for OER. Co2+(Oh) sites exhibit better activity than Co2+(Td). Theoretical calculation demonstrates the conversion of O* to OOH* is the rate-determining step (RDS) for Co3+(Oh) and Co2+(Td). For Co2+(Oh), it's thermodynamically favorable for the formation of OOH* but difficult for the desorption of O2. Co3+(Oh) needs to uphill the lowest Gibbs free energy than Co2+(Oh) and Co2+(Td), which contributes to the best activity. The coexist of Co3+(Oh) and Co2+(Td) in Co3O4 can effectively promote the formation of OOH* and decrease free energy barrier, which contributes to a charming OER activity.

{"title": "Co-Doped Ni3V2O8 Nanofibers Achieving d-d Orbital Coupling for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction.", "abstract": "Efficient and robust non-platinum-group metal electrocatalysts for O2 reduction are a prerequisite for practical high-performance fuel cells and metal-air batteries. Herein, we reported an integrated principle of gradient electrospinning and controllable pyrolysis to fabricate various Co-doped Ni3V2O8 nanofibers with high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. The representative Co1.3Ni1.7V2O8 nanofibers showed outstanding ORR performance in an alkaline solution with a half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.874 V vs RHE, along with high long-term stability. Furthermore, the introduction of Co could effectively restrain the growth of nanoparticles and change the electronic structure of Ni3V2O8. Control experiments and theoretical calculations demonstrated that upon Co-doping, the hybridization between the 3d orbital for both Co and Ni guaranteed the stable adsorption interaction with O2 over Ni and Co metal centers. Meanwhile, the weakened binding ability of Ni3V2O8 to OH* reduced the ORR free energy. Overall, the synergistic effect of Co and Ni metal cations essentially reflected the origin of ORR activity on the Co-doped Ni3V2O8 nanofibers.

{"title": "Abstract representations of events arise from mental errors in learning and memory", "abstract": "Humans are adept at uncovering abstract associations in the world around them, yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Intuitively, learning the higher-order structure of statistical relationships should involve complex mental processes. Here we propose an alternative perspective: that higher-order associations instead arise from natural errors in learning and memory. Using the free energy principle, which bridges information theory and Bayesian inference, we derive a maximum entropy model of people’s internal representations of the transitions between stimuli. Importantly, our model (i) affords a concise analytic form, (ii) qualitatively explains the effects of transition network structure on human expectations, and (iii) quantitatively predicts human reaction times in probabilistic sequential motor tasks. Together, these results suggest that mental errors influence our abstract representations of the world in significant and predictable ways, with direct implications for the study and design of optimally learnable information sources. Humans can easily uncover abstract associations. Here, the authors propose that higher-order associations arise from natural errors in learning and memory.

{"title": "Dynamic Expectation Maximization Algorithm for Estimation of Linear Systems with Colored Noise", "abstract": "The free energy principle from neuroscience has recently gained traction as one of the most prominent brain theories that can emulate the brain’s perception and action in a bio-inspired manner. This renders the theory with the potential to hold the key for general artificial intelligence. Leveraging this potential, this paper aims to bridge the gap between neuroscience and robotics by reformulating an FEP-based inference scheme—Dynamic Expectation Maximization—into an algorithm that can perform simultaneous state, input, parameter, and noise hyperparameter estimation of any stable linear state space system subjected to colored noises. The resulting estimator was proved to be of the form of an augmented coupled linear estimator. Using this mathematical formulation, we proved that the estimation steps have theoretical guarantees of convergence. The algorithm was rigorously tested in simulation on a wide variety of linear systems with colored noises. The paper concludes by demonstrating the superior performance of DEM for parameter estimation under colored noise in simulation, when compared to the state-of-the-art estimators like Sub Space method, Prediction Error Minimization (PEM), and Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. These results contribute to the applicability of DEM as a robust learning algorithm for safe robotic applications.", "authors": [{"name": "A. Meera", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "M.

{"title": "Influence of Divalent Transition-Metal Cations on the Oxygen Evolution Reaction Activity of Layered Double Hydroxide Nanosheets in Seawater Electrolysis.", "abstract": "Developing cost-effective, durable electrocatalysts for seawater electrolysis requires precise regulation of intermediate adsorption energetics governed by the d-band center (Ed) of active metal sites. Here, we systematically decouple the intrinsic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of monotransition-metal hydroxides (MAl-LDHs, M = Fe, Co, Ni) by synthesizing phase-pure catalysts to eliminate synergistic effects. Electrochemical evaluations in alkaline simulated seawater reveal CoAl-LDH's supremacy, achieving overpotentials of 340 mV @ 10 mA cm-2, which is lower than FeAl- and NiAl-LDH, alongside rapid kinetics (Tafel slope: 62.42 mV dec-1) and exceptional stability (50 mA cm-2, 50 h in natural seawater).

{"title": "The emergence of synchrony in networks of mutually inferring neurons", "abstract": "This paper considers the emergence of a generalised synchrony in ensembles of coupled self-organising systems, such as neurons. We start from the premise that any self-organising system complies with the free energy principle, in virtue of placing an upper bound on its entropy. Crucially, the free energy principle allows one to interpret biological systems as inferring the state of their environment or external milieu. An emergent property of this inference is synchronisation among an ensemble of systems that infer each other. Here, we investigate the implications of neuronal dynamics by simulating neuronal networks, where each neuron minimises its free energy. We cast the ensuing ensemble dynamics in terms of inference and show that cardinal behaviours of neuronal networks – both in vivo and in vitro – can be explained by this framework. In particular, we test the hypotheses that (i) generalised synchrony is an emergent property of free energy minimisation; thereby explaining synchronisation in the resting brain: (ii) desynchronisation is induced by exogenous input; thereby explaining event-related desynchronisation and (iii) structure learning emerges in response to causal structure in exogenous input; thereby explaining functional segregation in real neuronal systems.", "authors": [{"name": "E.

{"title": "Modelling Trial-by-Trial Changes in the Mismatch Negativity", "abstract": "The mismatch negativity (MMN) is a differential brain response to violations of learned regularities. It has been used to demonstrate that the brain learns the statistical structure of its environment and predicts future sensory inputs. However, the algorithmic nature of these computations and the underlying neurobiological implementation remain controversial. This article introduces a mathematical framework with which competing ideas about the computational quantities indexed by MMN responses can be formalized and tested against single-trial EEG data. This framework was applied to five major theories of the MMN, comparing their ability to explain trial-by-trial changes in MMN amplitude. Three of these theories (predictive coding, model adjustment, and novelty detection) were formalized by linking the MMN to different manifestations of the same computational mechanism: approximate Bayesian inference according to the free-energy principle. We thereby propose a unifying view on three distinct theories of the MMN. The relative plausibility of each theory was assessed against empirical single-trial MMN amplitudes acquired from eight healthy volunteers in a roving oddball experiment. Models based on the free-energy principle provided more plausible explanations of trial-by-trial changes in MMN amplitude than models representing the two more traditional theories (change detection and adaptation). Our results suggest that the MMN reflects approximate Bayesian learning of sensory regularities, and that the MMN-generating process adjusts a probabilistic model of the environment according to prediction errors.", "authors": [{"name": "Falk Lieder", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "J.

{"title": "Meta-Representational Predictive Coding: Biomimetic Self-Supervised Learning", "abstract": "Self-supervised learning has become an increasingly important paradigm in the domain of machine intelligence. Furthermore, evidence for self-supervised adaptation, such as contrastive formulations, has emerged in recent computational neuroscience and brain-inspired research. Nevertheless, current work on self-supervised learning relies on biologically implausible credit assignment -- in the form of backpropagation of errors -- and feedforward inference, typically a forward-locked pass. Predictive coding, in its mechanistic form, offers a biologically plausible means to sidestep these backprop-specific limitations. However, unsupervised predictive coding rests on learning a generative model of raw pixel input (akin to ``generative AI'' approaches), which entails predicting a potentially high dimensional input; on the other hand, supervised predictive coding, which learns a mapping between inputs to target labels, requires human annotation, and thus incurs the drawbacks of supervised learning. In this work, we present a scheme for self-supervised learning within a neurobiologically plausible framework that appeals to the free energy principle, constructing a new form of predictive coding that we call meta-representational predictive coding (MPC). MPC sidesteps the need for learning a generative model of sensory input (e.g., pixel-level features) by learning to predict representations of sensory input across parallel streams, resulting in an encoder-only learning and inference scheme. This formulation rests on active inference (in the form of sensory glimpsing) to drive the learning of representations, i.e., the representational dynamics are driven by sequences of decisions made by the model to sample informative portions of its sensorium.", "authors": [{"name": "Alexander G.

{"title": "Dynamical theory of topological defects II: universal aspects of defect motion", "abstract": "We study the dynamics of topological defects in continuum theories governed by a free energy minimization principle, building on our recently developed framework (Romano et al 2023 J. Stat. Mech. 083211). We show how the equation of motion of point defects, domain walls, disclination lines and any other singularity can be understood with one unifying mathematical framework. For disclination lines, this also allows us to study the interplay between the internal line tension and the interaction with other lines. This interplay is non-trivial, allowing defect loops to expand, instead of contracting, due to external interaction. We also use this framework to obtain an analytical description of two long-lasting problems in point defect motion, namely the scale dependence of the defect mobility and the role of elastic anisotropy in the motion of defects in liquid crystals. For the former, we show that the effective defect mobility is strongly problem-dependent, but it can be computed with high accuracy for a pair of annihilating defects. For the latter, we show that at the first order in perturbation theory, anisotropy causes a non-radial force, making the trajectory of annihilating defects deviate from a straight line. At higher orders, it also induces a correction in the mobility, which becomes non-isotropic for the +1/2 defect. We argue that, due to its generality, our method can help to shed light on the motion of singularities in many different systems, including driven and active non-equilibrium theories.", "authors": [{"name": "Jacopo Romano", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Benoît Mahault", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "R.

{"title": "The Thalamus as a Blackboard for Perception and Planning", "abstract": "It has been suggested that the thalamus acts as a blackboard, on which the computations of different cortical modules are composed, coordinated, and integrated. This article asks what blackboard role the thalamus might play, and whether that role is consistent with the neuroanatomy of the thalamus. It does so in a context of Bayesian belief updating, expressed as a Free Energy Principle. We suggest that the thalamus-as-a-blackboard offers important questions for research in spatial cognition. Several prominent features of the thalamus—including its lack of olfactory relay function, its lack of internal excitatory connections, its regular and conserved shape, its inhibitory interneurons, triadic synapses, and diffuse cortical connectivity—are consistent with a blackboard role.Different thalamic nuclei may play different blackboard roles: (1) the Pulvinar, through its reciprocal connections to posterior cortical regions, coordinates perceptual inference about “what is where” from multi-sense-data. (2) The Mediodorsal (MD) nucleus, through its connections to the prefrontal cortex, and the other thalamic nuclei linked to the motor cortex, uses the same generative model for planning and learning novel spatial movements. (3) The paraventricular nucleus may compute risk-reward trade-offs. We also propose that as any new movement is practiced a few times, cortico-thalamocortical (CTC) links entrain the corresponding cortico-cortical links, through a process akin to supervised learning. Subsequently, the movement becomes a fast unconscious habit, not requiring the MD nucleus or other thalamic nuclei, and bypassing the thalamic bottleneck.", "authors": [{"name": "R.

{"title": "Measuring the Magnetic Origins of Solar Flares, Coronal Mass Ejections, and Space Weather", "abstract": "We take a broad look at the problem of identifying the magnetic solar causes of space weather. With the lackluster performance of extrapolations based upon magnetic field measurements in the photosphere, we identify a region in the near-UV (NUV) part of the spectrum as optimal for studying the development of magnetic free energy over active regions. Using data from SORCE, the Hubble Space Telescope, and SKYLAB, along with 1D computations of the NUV spectrum and numerical experiments based on the MURaM radiation–magnetohydrodynamic and HanleRT radiative transfer codes, we address multiple challenges. These challenges are best met through a combination of NUV lines of bright Mg ii, and lines of Fe ii and Fe i (mostly within the 4s–4p transition array) which form in the chromosphere up to 2 × 104 K. Both Hanle and Zeeman effects can in principle be used to derive vector magnetic fields. However, for any given spectral line the τ = 1 surfaces are generally geometrically corrugated owing to fine structure such as fibrils and spicules. By using multiple spectral lines spanning different optical depths, magnetic fields across nearly horizontal surfaces can be inferred in regions of low plasma β, from which free energies, magnetic topology, and other quantities can be derived. Based upon the recently reported successful sub-orbital space measurements of magnetic fields with the CLASP2 instrument, we argue that a modest space-borne telescope will be able to make significant advances in the attempts to predict solar eruptions. Difficulties associated with blended lines are shown to be minor in an Appendix.", "authors": [{"name": "P. Judge", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "M.

{"title": "Multiple-Fold Fermions and Topological Fermi Arcs Induced Catalytic Enhancement in Nanoporous Electride C12A7", "abstract": "Topological materials are recently regarded as the idea catalysts due to the protected surface metallic states and high carrier mobility, however the fundamental mechanism and the underlying relationship between the catalytic performance and topological states are in debate. Here, by means of symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we discover that the electride material of C12A7:4e− hosts the multiplefold fermions due to the interstitial-electrons, with the sixfoldand fourfolddegenerate points locating at high symmetric points near the Fermi energy, which are identified as the underlying reason of the enhanced catalytic ability in C12A7:4e−-based catalysts. The multiple-fold fermions exhibit much longer Fermi arcs on the (001) surface than traditional Weyl/Dirac fermions, the surface is thus highly chemical active and possesses a low Gibbs free energy (∆GH* = 0.24 eV) for the hydrogen evolution reaction. The underlying relationship between catalytic performance and the topological surface state is explicitly verified by artificially hole doping, external strain and similar electride without the Fermi arcs, where the Gibbs free energies are significantly increased when the Fermi arcs is shifted to higher energy level. This work offers a guiding principle for understanding catalytic nature of electrides and the topological quantum catalysts.", "authors": [{"name": "W.

{"title": "Norm-Product Belief Propagation: Primal-Dual Message-Passing for Approximate Inference", "abstract": "Inference problems in graphical models can be represented as a constrained optimization of a free-energy function. In this paper, we treat both forms of probabilistic inference, estimating marginal probabilities of the joint distribution and finding the most probable assignment, through a unified message-passing algorithm architecture. In particular we generalize the belief propagation (BP) algorithms of sum-product and max-product and tree-reweighted (TRW) sum and max product algorithms (TRBP) and introduce a new set of convergent algorithms based on “convex-free-energy” and linear-programming (LP) relaxation as a zero-temperature of a convex-free-energy. The main idea of this work arises from taking a general perspective on the existing BP and TRBP algorithms while observing that they all are reductions from the basic optimization formula of f +Σihi where the function f is an extended-valued, strictly convex but nonsmooth and the functions hi are extended-valued functions (not necessarily convex). We use tools from convex duality to present the “primal-dual ascent” algorithm which is an extension of the Bregman successive projection scheme and is designed to handle optimization of the general type f + Σihi. We then map the fractional-free-energy variational principle for approximate inference onto the optimization formula above and introduce the “norm-product” message-passing algorithm. Special cases of the norm-product include sum-product and max-product (BP algorithms), TRBP and NMPLP algorithms. When the fractional-free-energy is set to be convex (convex-free-energy) the norm-product is globally convergent for the estimation of marginal probabilities and for approximating the LP-relaxation. We also introduce another branch of the norm-product which arises as the “zero-temperature” of the convex-free-energy which we refer to as the “convex-max-product”. The convex-max-product is convergent (unlike max-product) and aims at solving the LP- relaxation.", "authors": [{"name": "Tamir Hazan", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "A.

{"title": "Entropy as a Gate or Source for Electronic Energy Transfer in Donor-Multiple Acceptor Systems", "abstract": "Charge and electronic energy transfer form the basis of many natural and artificial energy transduction systems. The energy landscapes that drive these transfer processes are often constructed from enthalpy driving force. In contrast, driving force from entropic gain, although occasionally invoked to explain some peculiar excited state dynamics, has rarely been used to actively control charge/energy flow. Here we demonstrate that entropy can either gate or power electronic energy transfer, using CsPbBr3 colloidal nanocrystals surface-functionalized with multiple phenanthrene triplet acceptors. Triplet energy transfer from photoexcited nanocrystals to phenanthrene is followed by thermally-activated repopulation of nanocrystal excitons, leading to delayed nanocrystal emission. The lifetime of delayed emission increases with the phenanthrene/nanocrystal ratio, due to lowering of the free energy of the acceptor state by entropic gain. Moreover, entropic gain enables nominally “endothermic” sensitization of phenanthrene triplets using nanocrystals of lower exciton energy than molecular triplets. The principle of using entropy as a gate to modulate, or as a source to power, charge/energy flow is generically applicable to many other energy transduction systems containing multiple donor/acceptor units.", "authors": [{"name": "Sha He", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Yaoyao Han", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Kaifeng Wu", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2021, "doi": "10.2139/SSRN.3811872", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": "cb13e205cbc7eac3e6bb21a7eec27b66ca2a86ca", "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "A Variational Inference Framework for Soft-In Soft-Out Detection in Multiple-Access Channels", "abstract": "We propose a unified framework for deriving and studying soft-in soft-out (SISO) detection in multiple-access channels using the concept of variational inference. The proposed framework may be used in multiple-access interference (MAI), intersymbol interference (ISI), and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels. Without loss of generality, we will focus our attention on turbo multiuser detection, to facilitate a more concrete discussion. It is shown that, with some loss of optimality, variational inference avoids the exponential complexity of a posteriori probability (APP) detection by optimizing a closely related, but much more manageable, objective function called variational free energy. In addition to its systematic appeal, there are several other advantages to this viewpoint. First of all, it provides unified and rigorous justifications for numerous detectors that were proposed on radically different grounds, and facilitates convenient joint detection and decoding (utilizing the turbo principle) when error-control codes are incorporated. Second, efficient joint parameter estimation and data detection is possible via the variational expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, such that the detrimental effect of inaccurate channel knowledge at the receiver may be dealt with systematically. We are also able to extend BPSK-based SISO detection schemes to arbitrary square QAM constellations in a rigorous manner using a variational argument.", "authors": [{"name": "D.

{"title": "Improving the Efficiency of Water Splitting and Oxygen Reduction Via Single‐Atom Anchoring on Graphyne Support", "abstract": "Single‐atom catalysts (SACs) have received significant interest for optimizing metal atom utilization and superior catalytic performance in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). In this study, we investigate a range of single‐transition metal (STM1 = Sc1, Ti1, V1, Cr1, Mn1, Fe1, Co1, Ni1, Cu1, Zr1, Nb1, Mo1, Ru1, Rh1, Pd1, Ag1, W1, Re1, Os1, Ir1, Pt1, and Au1) atoms supported on graphyne (GY) surface for HER/OER and ORR using first‐principle calculations. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations and phonon dispersion spectra reveal the dynamic and thermal stabilities of the GY surface. The exceptional stability of all supported STM1 atoms within the H1 cavity of the GY surface exists in an isolated form, facilitating the uniform distribution and proper arrangement of single atoms on GY. In particular, Sc1, Co1, Fe1, and Au1/GY demonstrate promising catalytic efficiency in the HER due to idealistic ΔGH* values via the Volmer‐Heyrovsky pathway. Notably, Sc1 and Au1/GY exhibit superior HER catalytic activity compared to other studied catalysts. Co1/GY catalyst exhibits higher selectivity and activity for the OER, with an overpotential (0.46 V) comparable to MoC2, IrO2, and RuO2. Also, Rh1 and Co1/GY SACs exhibited promising electrocatalysts for the ORR, with an overpotential of 0.36 and 0.46 V, respectively. Therefore, Co1/GY is a versatile electrocatalyst for metal‐air batteries and water‐splitting. This study further incorporates computational analysis of the kinetic potential energy barriers of Co1 and Rh1 in the OER and ORR. A strong correlation is found between the estimated kinetic activation barriers for the thermodynamic outcomes and all proton‐coupled electron transfer steps. We establish a relation for the Gibbs free energy of intermediates to understand the mechanism of SACs supported on STM1/GY and introduce a key descriptor.

{"title": "Targeting MERTK tyrosine kinase: Virtual screening and molecular dynamics insights for anti-cancer drug development", "abstract": "Global public health facing serious challenges due to the incidence of cancer and the growth of treatment resistance. Mer-tyrosine kinase plays a crucial role in cell biology and correlated with many cancers such as Epithelial ovarian cancer, liver cancer, breast cancer, Metastatic melanoma, and Acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Hence the identification of novel drug for MERTK protein is extreme important. In this research, we used computational techniques, molecular operating environment (MOE 2015) for virtual screening with drug like natural compounds library. We used known compound UNC2025 as positive control and one million compounds was retrieved from different databases (OTAVA, ZINC, ChEMBL) and docked with MERTK protein. Out of million compounds the 4 top hit inhibitors chosen from docking were further screened for ADMET profiling confirming their compliance with drug designing and toxicological principle and subjected to molecular dynamic (MD) simulation and MM-PBSA analysis. The results of these analyses showed that only four compounds that make strong interactions with MERTK protein via highest binding affinity hydrogen bond and hydrophobic contacts (lig1, lig2, lig3, lig4). The computed binding affinity ranges from –22.977 to –18.707 kcal/mol. The increased helix and reduced β–sheet contents in MERTK on the binding of top hit candidates depicted the higher structural stability of MERTK, rather than MERTK alone and MERTK–UNC2025. The study finds critical residues which serve a vital part in binding with the inhibitor and the active site of the MERTK protein, i.e., Phe598, Gly599, Lys619, Arg629, Glu633, Glu637, Arg722, Asp723, Arg727, Asp741, Gly743, Leu744, Lys746, Arg758, Ala760, and Lys761 through decomposed binding free energy analysis.

{"title": "Special issue on world models and predictive coding in robotics (Part I)", "abstract": "We are pleased to announce the special issue on World Models and Predictive Coding in Robotics. The pursuit of autonomous cognitive-developmental robots has long been a high aspiration within the field of robotics, and creating cognitive dynamics that enable robots to learn and adapt through sensorimotor interactions is a key challenge in cognitive and developmental robotics. This special issue focuses on the concept of world models, which allow robots to predict future sensory observations and optimize behavior based on the sensory consequences of actions, in line with the framework of predictive coding and the free energy principle in contemporary neuroscience. While world models have shown promise in robotics, their application has been mostly limited to simulationbased investigations, and the challenges associated with developing autonomous cognitive and developmental robots based on these principles have yet to be fully explored in real-world settings. This special issue aims to report the latest research results in these fields and stimulate discussions on the future of cognitive-developmental robotics. We received numerous paper submissions and have accepted four papers for the first issue. The first volume of our special issue comprises four original works. First, T. Taniguchi et al. discuss the frontiers and challenges in world models and predictive coding for cognitive and developmental robotics, providing a survey and perspective on the field. Second, T. Kobayashi et al. propose a method using a Tsallis-based variational autoencoder (q-VAE) to facilitate sparsification of the latent space, enabling robots to extract low-dimensional latent representations in world model learning. Third, Y. Kobayashi et al. introduce a multi-view object-centric model with a global latent variable that represents the spatial configuration of objects in a scene, addressing the limitations of existing models. Fourth, A. Taniguchi et al. propose an active inferencemethod called spatial concept formation with information gain-based active exploration (SpCoAE), which combines sequential Bayesian inference using particle filters and information gainbased target determination in a probabilistic generative model. We would like to express our gratitude to all authors who submitted their original papers to this special issue. We also extend our thanks to the reviewers for their valuable comments that have significantly contributed to improving the quality of each paper. Finally, we would like to acknowledge the great assistance provided by Ms. Noriko Watanabe of Advanced Robotics.", "authors": [{"name": "T.

{"title": "Quantifying dissipation in actomyosin networks", "abstract": "Quantifying entropy production in various active matter phases will open new avenues for probing self-organization principles in these far-from-equilibrium systems. It has been hypothesized that the dissipation of free energy by active matter systems may be optimized, leading to system trajectories with histories of large dissipation and an accompanying emergence of ordered dynamical states. This interesting idea has not been widely tested. In particular, it is not clear whether emergent states of actomyosin networks, which represent a salient example of biological active matter, self-organize following the principle of dissipation optimization. In order to start addressing this question using detailed computational modelling, we rely on the MEDYAN simulation platform, which allows simulating active matter networks from fundamental molecular principles. We have extended the capabilities of MEDYAN to allow quantification of the rates of dissipation resulting from chemical reactions and relaxation of mechanical stresses during simulation trajectories. This is done by computing precise changes in Gibbs free energy accompanying chemical reactions using a novel formula and through detailed calculations of instantaneous values of the system’s mechanical energy. We validate our approach with a mean-field model that estimates the rates of dissipation from filament treadmilling. Applying this methodology to the self-organization of small disordered actomyosin networks, we find that compact and highly cross-linked networks tend to allow more efficient transduction of chemical free energy into mechanical energy. In these simple systems, we observe that spontaneous network reorganizations tend to result in a decrease in the total dissipation rate to a low steady-state value.

{"title": "First use of synoptic vector magnetograms for global nonlinear, force-free coronal magnetic field models", "abstract": "Context. The magnetic field permeating the solar atmosphere is generally thought to provide the energy for much of the activity seen in the solar corona, such as flares, coronal mass ejections (CMEs), etc. To overcome the unavailability of coronal magnetic field measurements, photospheric magnetic field vector data can be used to reconstruct the coronal field. Currently, there are several modelling techniques being used to calculate three-dimensional field lines into the solar atmosphere. Aims. For the first time, synoptic maps of a photospheric-vector magnetic field synthesized from the vector spectromagnetograph (VSM) on Synoptic Optical Long-term Investigations of the Sun (SOLIS) are used to model the coronal magnetic field and estimate free magnetic energy in the global scale. The free energy (i.e., the energy in excess of the potential field energy) is one of the main indicators used in space weather forecasts to predict the eruptivity of active regions. Methods. We solve the nonlinear force-free field equations using an optimization principle in spherical geometry. The resulting threedimensional magnetic fields are used to estimate the magnetic free energy content E(sub free) = E(sub nlfff) E(sub pot), which is the difference of the magnetic energies between the nonpotential field and the potential field in the global solar corona. For comparison, we overlay the extrapolated magnetic field lines with the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) observations by the atmospheric imaging assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Results. For a single Carrington rotation 2121, we find that the global nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) magnetic energy density is 10.3% higher than the potential one. Most of this free energy is located in active regions.", "authors": [{"name": "T. Tadesse", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "T.

{"title": "Strengthened beliefs under psychedelics (SEBUS)? A Commentary on “REBUS and the Anarchic Brain: Toward a Unified Model of the Brain Action of Psychedelics”", "abstract": "In introducing a model of “relaxed beliefs under psychedelics” (REBUS), Carhart-Harris and Friston (2019) have presented a compelling account of the effects of psychedelics on brain and mind. This model is contextualized within the Free Energy Principle (Friston et al., 2006; Friston, 2010), which may represent the first unified paradigm in the mind and life sciences. By this view, mental systems adaptively regulate their actions and interactions with the world via predictive models, whose dynamics are governed by a singular objective of minimizing prediction-error, or “free energy.” According to REBUS, psychedelics flatten the depth of free energy landscapes, or the differential attracting forces associated with various (Bayesian) beliefs, so promoting flexibility in inference and learning. Here, I would like to propose an alternative account of the effects of psychedelics that is in many ways compatible with REBUS, albeit with some important differences. Based on considerations of the distributions of 5-HT2a receptors within cortical laminae and canonical microcircuits for predictive coding, I propose that 5-HT2a agonism may also involve a strengthening of beliefs, particularly at intermediate levels of abstraction associated with conscious experience (Safron, 2020).", "authors": [{"name": "A.

{"title": "First-principles investigation of the hydrogen evolution reaction of transition metal phosphides CrP, MnP, FeP, CoP, and NiP.", "abstract": "We comprehensively investigated the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of a series of transition metal phosphides (MPs) (M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) using first-principles calculations. The free energy difference was calculated for possible sites on the surface to pinpoint the reactive sites and the associated catalytic activities. We found that the chemical properties of these considered MPs are different from those of WP, including CrP which has the same electronic configuration as WP but was shown not to be a good electrocatalyst. Different reactive sites other than WP were predicted, and notably, unlike WP, phosphorus can participate/catalyze the HER on the considered MP. Among these MPs, there are more active sites on FeP, CoP, and NiP than CrP and MnP. Our electronic structure analysis suggests that the spin polarization is critical in determining the hydrogen adsorption and hence the HER performance. We further explored the HER of metal- or phosphorus-deficit MPs, as samples can be grown under different conditions. In particular, phosphorus-deficit FeP, CoP, and NiP were found to have enhanced HER performance, with either better catalytic activities or more active sites. Therefore, we proposed that controlling of these defects can be an effective approach to tune the HER catalytic ability of these MPs. It can serve as the design principle to synthesize new MP based electrocatalysts.", "authors": [{"name": "Ta-Wei Wang", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Tan-Ling Wang", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Wan-Jou Chou", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Li-Fan Wu", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Shi-Hsin Lin", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2021, "doi": "10.1039/d0cp04789a", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": "cc422b196b88ce3a1b88c75cd05b8cc36b573c61", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "Physical Chemistry, Chemical Physics - PCCP", "citation_count": 20, "references": [], "publication_date": null}

{"title": "Synthesis of podophyllotoxin-glycosyl triazoles via click protocol mediated by silver (I)-N-heterocyclic carbenes and their anticancer evaluation as topoisomerase-II inhibitors", "abstract": "Abstract Herein we report the regioselective synthesis of podophyllotoxin-Glycosyl triazole hybrids catalysed by Ag(I)-N-heterocyclic carbene (Ag(I)-NHC) in a short reaction time (∼30 min) at ambient conditions. In principle, it is the first report of Click alkyne-azide cycloaddition catalysed by Ag(I)-NHC catalyst and moreover, this new methodology yielded good results when compared with traditional CuAAC in terms of reaction time and selectivity. The synthesised compounds were further explored for in vitro anticancer activity against four human cancer cell lines Du145, HeLa, A-549, and MCF-7 and found that these synthesised compounds possess significant anticancer activity. Further, the compounds 5a and 5e were identified as promising leads due to their better activity across all cell lines than that of the standard drug etoposide. Molecular docking studies of 5a & 5e with DNA Topoisomerase-II were revealed that the free energy calculations of active compounds were in good agreement with observed IC50 values.

{"title": "Direct Fisher Inference of the Quartic Oscillator's Eigenvalues", "abstract": "It is well known that a suggestive connection links Schrodinger’s equation (SE) and the information-optimizing principle based on Fisher’s information measure (FIM). It has been shown that this entails the existence of a Legendre transform structure underlying the SE. Such a structure leads to a first order partial differential equation (PDE) for the SE’s eigenvalues from which a complete solution for them can be obtained. We test this theory with regards to anharmonic oscillators (AHO). AHO pose a long-standing problem and received intense attention motivated by problems in quantum field theory and molecular physics. By appeal to the Cramer Rao bound we are able to Fisher-infer the energy eigenvalues without explicitly solving Schrodinger’s equation. Remarkably enough, and in contrast with standard variational approaches, our present procedure does not involve free fitting parameters.", "authors": [{"name": "S.

{"title": "A mechanistic theory of hydrogen embrittlement of steels", "abstract": "Consideration of the relation between the cohesive energy and the surface free energy leads to the inference that dissolved hydrogen reduces the maximum cohesive resistive force of which the iron lattice is capable. This forms the basis of a mechanistic model for the velocity of hydrogen‐induced crack propagation in steels. The crack grows when the local tensile elastic stress normal to the plane of the crack equals the local maximum cohesive force per unit area as reduced by the large concentration of hydrogen drawn there by the effect of elastic stress on the chemical potential of hydrogen. The velocity of the growth is given by the solution of the relevant transport equation for the accumulation of hydrogen. Although quantifiable in principle the theory remains implicit because of current ignorance of the needed functional relationships, but some qualitative predictions and insights are possible, as well as the specification of important experiments.", "authors": [{"name": "R.

First we calculate the limiting diffusion coefficient. Then we show that the ‘active part’ of the diffusion coefficient is in some sense maximal for reversible state processes. Further, we obtain a large deviations principle for the active particle in terms of the large deviations rate function of the empirical process corresponding to the state process. Again we show that the rate function and free energy function are (pointwise) optimal for reversible state processes.

Despite many promising ongoing progress, there are currently no FDA approved drug to treat infected patients. Recently, the crowdsourcing of drug discovery for inhibiting the main protease (Mpro) of SARS‐CoV‐2 have yielded a plenty of drug fragments resolved inside the active site of Mpro via the crystallography method. Following the principle of fragment‐based drug design (FBDD), we are motivated to design a potent drug candidate (named B19) by merging three fragments JFM, U0P, and HWH. Through extensive all‐atom molecular dynamics simulation and molecular docking, we found that B19 among all designed ones is most stable inside the Mpro's active site and the binding free energy of B19 is comparable to or even a little better than that of a native protein ligand processed by Mpro. Our promising results suggest that B19 and its derivatives can potentially be efficacious drug candidates for COVID‐19.", "authors": [{"name": "Binquan Luan", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "T.

{"title": "The Projective Consciousness Model: Projective Geometry at the Core of Consciousness and the Integration of Perception, Imagination, Motivation, Emotion, Social Cognition and Action", "abstract": "Consciousness has been described as acting as a global workspace that integrates perception, imagination, emotion and action programming for adaptive decision making. The mechanisms of this workspace and their relationships to the phenomenology of consciousness need to be further specified. Much research in this area has focused on the neural correlates of consciousness, but, arguably, computational modeling can better be used toward this aim. According to the Projective Consciousness Model (PCM), consciousness is structured as a viewpoint-organized, internal space, relying on 3D projective geometry and governed by the action of the Projective Group as part of a process of active inference. The geometry induces a group-structured subjective perspective on an encoded world model, enabling adaptive perspective taking in agents. Here, we review and discuss the PCM. We emphasize the role of projective mechanisms in perception and the appraisal of affective and epistemic values as tied to the motivation of action, under an optimization process of Free Energy minimization, or more generally stochastic optimal control. We discuss how these mechanisms enable us to model and simulate group-structured drives in the context of social cognition and to understand the mechanisms underpinning empathy, emotion expression and regulation, and approach–avoidance behaviors. We review previous results, drawing on applications in robotics and virtual humans. We briefly discuss future axes of research relating to applications of the model to simulation- and model-based behavioral science, geometrically structured artificial neural networks, the relevance of the approach for explainable AI and human–machine interactions, and the study of the neural correlates of consciousness.", "authors": [{"name": "D.

{"title": "An Enactive–Ecological Model to Guide Patient-Centered Osteopathic Care", "abstract": "Osteopaths commonly face complexity and clinical uncertainty in their daily professional practice as primary contact practitioners. In order to effectively deal with complex clinical presentations, osteopaths need to possess well-developed clinical reasoning to understand the individual patient’s lived experience of pain and other symptoms and how their problem impacts their personhood and ability to engage with their world. We have recently proposed (En)active inference as an integrative framework for osteopathic care. The enactivist and active inference frameworks underpin our integrative hypothesis. Here, we present a clinically based interpretation of our integrative hypothesis by considering the ecological niche in which osteopathic care occurs. Active inference enables patients and practitioners to disambiguate each other’s mental states. The patients’ mental states are unobservable and must be inferred based on perceptual cues such as posture, body language, gaze direction and response to touch and hands-on care. A robust therapeutic alliance centred on cooperative communication and shared narratives and the appropriate and effective use of touch and hands-on care enable patients to contextualize their lived experiences. Touch and hands-on care enhance the therapeutic alliance, mental state alignment, and biobehavioural synchrony between patient and practitioner. Therefore, the osteopath–patient dyad provides mental state alignment and opportunities for ecological niche construction. Arguably, this can produce therapeutic experiences which reduce the prominence given to high-level prediction errors—and consequently, the top-down attentional focus on bottom-up sensory prediction errors, thus minimizing free energy. This commentary paper primarily aims to enable osteopaths to critically consider the value of this proposed framework in appreciating the complexities of delivering person-centred care.", "authors": [{"name": "F.

{"title": "Predictive Coding or Evidence Accumulation? False Inference and Neuronal Fluctuations", "abstract": "Perceptual decisions can be made when sensory input affords an inference about what generated that input. Here, we report findings from two independent perceptual experiments conducted during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with a sparse event-related design. The first experiment, in the visual modality, involved forced-choice discrimination of coherence in random dot kinematograms that contained either subliminal or periliminal motion coherence. The second experiment, in the auditory domain, involved free response detection of (non-semantic) near-threshold acoustic stimuli. We analysed fluctuations in ongoing neural activity, as indexed by fMRI, and found that neuronal activity in sensory areas (extrastriate visual and early auditory cortex) biases perceptual decisions towards correct inference and not towards a specific percept. Hits (detection of near-threshold stimuli) were preceded by significantly higher activity than both misses of identical stimuli or false alarms, in which percepts arise in the absence of appropriate sensory input. In accord with predictive coding models and the free-energy principle, this observation suggests that cortical activity in sensory brain areas reflects the precision of prediction errors and not just the sensory evidence or prediction errors per se.", "authors": [{"name": "G.

{"title": "Stochastic control liasons: Richard Sinkhorn meets Gaspard Monge on a Schroedinger bridge", "abstract": "In 1931/32, Schroedinger studied a hot gas Gedankenexperiment, an instance of large deviations of the empirical distribution and an early example of the so-called maximum entropy inference method. This so-called Schroedinger bridge problem (SBP) was recently recognized as a regularization of the Monge-Kantorovich Optimal Mass Transport (OMT), leading to effective computation of the latter. Specifically, OMT with quadratic cost may be viewed as a zero-temperature limit of SBP, which amounts to minimization of the Helmholtz's free energy over probability distributions constrained to possess given marginals. The problem features a delicate compromise, mediated by a temperature parameter, between minimizing the internal energy and maximizing the entropy. These concepts are central to a rapidly expanding area of modern science dealing with the so-called {\\em Sinkhorn algorithm} which appears as a special case of an algorithm first studied by the French analyst Robert Fortet in 1938/40 specifically for Schroedinger bridges. Due to the constraint on end-point distributions, dynamic programming is not a suitable tool to attack these problems. Instead, Fortet's iterative algorithm and its discrete counterpart, the Sinkhorn iteration, permit computation by iteratively solving the so-called {\\em Schroedinger system}. In both the continuous as well as the discrete-time and space settings, {\\em stochastic control} provides a reformulation and dynamic versions of these problems. The formalism behind these control problems have attracted attention as they lead to a variety of new applications in spacecraft guidance, control of robot or biological swarms, sensing, active cooling, network routing as well as in computer and data science. This multifacet and versatile framework, intertwining SBP and OMT, provides the substrate for a historical and technical overview of the field taken up in this paper.", "authors": [{"name": "Yongxin Chen", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "T.

{"title": "Intrinsic OXPHOS limitations underlie cellular bioenergetics in leukemia", "abstract": "Currently there is great interest in targeting mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in cancer. However, notwithstanding the targeting of mutant dehydrogenases, nearly all hopeful ‘mito-therapeutics’ cannot discriminate cancerous from non-cancerous OXPHOS and thus suffer from a limited therapeutic index. Using acute myeloid leukemia (AML) as a model, herein, we leveraged an in-house diagnostic biochemical workflow to identify ‘actionable’ bioenergetic vulnerabilities intrinsic to cancerous mitochondria. Consistent with prior reports, AML growth and proliferation was associated with a hyper-metabolic phenotype which included increases in basal and maximal respiration. However, despite having nearly 2-fold more mitochondria per cell, clonally expanding hematopoietic stem cells, leukemic blasts, as well as chemoresistant AML were all consistently hallmarked by intrinsic OXPHOS limitations. Remarkably, by performing experiments across a physiological span of ATP free energy, we provide direct evidence that leukemic mitochondria are particularly poised to consume ATP. Relevant to AML biology, acute restoration of oxidative ATP synthesis proved highly cytotoxic to leukemic blasts, suggesting that active OXPHOS repression supports aggressive disease dissemination in AML. Together, these findings argue against ATP being the primary output of leukemic mitochondria and provide proof-of-principle that restoring, rather than disrupting, OXPHOS may represent an untapped therapeutic avenue for combatting hematological malignancy and chemoresistance.", "authors": [{"name": "Margaret A.

{"title": "Accurate computation of quantum excited states with neural networks", "abstract": "We present an algorithm to estimate the excited states of a quantum system by variational Monte Carlo, which has no free parameters and requires no orthogonalization of the states, instead transforming the problem into that of finding the ground state of an expanded system. Arbitrary observables can be calculated, including off-diagonal expectations, such as the transition dipole moment. The method works particularly well with neural network ansätze, and by combining this method with the FermiNet and Psiformer ansätze, we can accurately recover excitation energies and oscillator strengths on a range of molecules. We achieve accurate vertical excitation energies on benzene-scale molecules, including challenging double excitations. Beyond the examples presented in this work, we expect that this technique will be of interest for atomic, nuclear, and condensed matter physics. Editor’s summary Excited states are important in many areas of physics and chemistry; however, scalable, accurate, and robust calculations of excited-state properties from first principles remain a critical theoretical challenge. Recent advances in computing the ground-state properties of molecular systems driven by deep learning demonstrate that this technique has the potential to address this problem. Pfau et al. present a parameter-free mathematical principle for computing excited states using deep neural networks by directly generalizing variational quantum Monte Carlo to ground states. The proposed method achieves accurate excited-state calculations on a number of atoms and molecules, far outperforms existing methods for computing excited-state properties with deep learning (especially on larger systems), and can be applied to various quantum systems. —Yury Suleymanov INTRODUCTION Understanding the physics of how matter interacts with light requires accurate modeling of electronic excited states of quantum systems. This underpins the behavior of photocatalysts, fluorescent dyes, quantum dots, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), lasers, solar cells, and more. Existing quantum chemistry methods for excited states can be much more inaccurate than those for ground states, sometimes qualitatively so, or can require prior knowledge targeted to specific states. Neural networks combined with variational Monte Carlo (VMC) have achieved remarkable accuracy for ground state wave functions for a range of systems, including spin models, molecules, and condensed matter systems. Although VMC has been used to study excited states, prior approaches have limitations that make it difficult or impossible to use them with neural networks and often have many free parameters that require tuning to achieve good results. RATIONALE We combine the flexibility of neural network ansätze with a mathematical insight that allows us to convert the problem of finding excited states of a system to one of finding the ground state of an expanded system, which can then be tackled with standard VMC. We call this approach natural excited states VMC (NES-VMC). Linear independence of the excited states is automatically imposed through the functional form of the ansatz. The energy and other observables of each excited state are obtained from diagonalizing the matrix of Hamiltonian expectation values taken over the single-state ansätze, which can be accumulated with no additional cost. Crucially, this approach has no free parameters to tune and needs no penalty terms to enforce orthogonalization. We examined the accuracy of this approach with two different neural network architectures—the FermiNet and Psiformer. RESULTS We demonstrated our approach on benchmark systems ranging from individual atoms up to molecules the size of benzene. We validated the accuracy of NES-VMC on first-row atoms, closely matching experimental results, and on a range of small molecules, obtaining highly accurate energies and oscillator strengths comparable to existing best theoretical estimates. We computed the potential energy curves of the lowest excited states of the carbon dimer and identified the states across bond lengths by analyzing their symmetries and spins. The NES-VMC vertical excitation energies matched those obtained using the highly accurate semistochastic heat-bath configuration interaction (SHCI) method to within chemical accuracy for all bond lengths, whereas the adiabatic excitations were within 4 meV of experimental values on average—a fourfold improvement over SHCI. In the case of ethylene, NES-VMC correctly described the conical intersection of the twisted molecule and was in excellent agreement with highly accurate multireference configuration interaction (MR-CI) results. We also considered five challenging systems with low-lying double excitations, including multiple benzene-scale molecules. On all systems where there is good agreement between methods on the vertical excitation energies, the Psiformer was within chemical accuracy across states, including butadiene, where even the ordering of certain states has been disputed for many decades. On tetrazine and cyclopentadienone, where state-of-the-art calculations from just a few years ago were known to be inaccurate, NES-VMC results closely matched recent sophisticated diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) and complete-active-space third-order perturbation theory (CASPT3) calculations. Finally, we considered the benzene molecule, where NES-VMC combined with the Psiformer ansatz is in substantially better agreement with theoretical best estimates compared with other methods, including neural network ansätze using penalty methods. This both validates the mathematical correctness of our approach and shows that neural networks can accurately represent excited states of molecules right at the current limit of computational approaches. CONCLUSION NES-VMC is a parameter-free and mathematically sound variational principle for excited states. Combining it with neural network ansätze enables marked accuracy across a wide range of benchmark problems. The development of an accurate VMC approach to excited states of quantum systems opens many possibilities and substantially expands the scope of applications of neural network wave functions. Although we considered only electronic excitations of molecular systems and neural network ansätze, NES-VMC is applicable to any quantum Hamiltonian and any ansatz, enabling accurate computational studies that could improve our understanding of vibronic couplings, optical bandgaps, nuclear physics, and other challenging problems.

Evidence of α-amyloid formation in the active core of the human LL-37 protein (comprising residues 17 to 29) was associated with this peptide's membranolytic property. Though mechanistic pathways of β-amyloid formation are known, such studies are scarce in α-amyloids. Modern computational techniques allow such mechanistic studies in molecular detail. Here, we propose aggregation pathways in hLL-3717-29 through molecular dynamics simulations. We first identified oligomers among peptides based on a distance criterion. The distribution of oligomers was then used to build Markov state models from which pathways were obtained using the framework of transition path theory. We checked the structural stability of the peptides during oligomerization, which is crucial from their functional point of view. We also investigated the key residues that participate in oligomer formation, the interactions between them, and the effect of residue mutations on the binding free energy of the peptides. Our findings suggest that larger oligomers are produced from the association of smaller and intermediate oligomers. The peptides retain their helical structure during aggregation with transient occurrences of 3-10 helix and turns. Hydrophobic interactions are vital in the aggregation of these peptides with Ile24 playing a crucial role. Mutation of this residue to alanine decreases the peptides' binding free energy, resulting in reduced aggregation tendency.", "authors": [{"name": "Aritra Mitra", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Sandip Paul", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2023, "doi": "10.1021/acs.jpcb.3c04742", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": "bac6000752724d2729feec5cc3187b673cf5cfd4", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "Journal of Physical Chemistry B", "citation_count": 8, "references": [], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Overcoming Hurdles in Oxygen Evolution Catalyst Discovery via Codesign", "abstract": "The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is central to several sustainable energy technologies. Catalyst development has largely focused on lowering the overpotential and eliminating reliance on precious metals, revealing stark differences in alkaline and acidic OER. In alkaline electrolyte, precious metal-free catalysts have approached the limiting overpotential from established free energy scaling relationships, and our survey of complex metal oxides shows that this limit can be approached with a broad range of catalysts. In acidic electrolyte, electrochemical instabilities create a dual challenge of a dearth of nonprecious metal OER catalysts with overpotential below 0.5 V and a high dissolved metals concentration for most precious metal-free catalysts. On device-relevant time scales, the high dissolved metals concentrations compromise device stability, for example, through a decrease of performance and due to metal exchange between anode and cathode catalysts due to finite permeability of ion exchange membranes. These considerations motivate a substantial increase in monitoring and reporting of dissolved metals concentrations in OER experiments. To facilitate durability-based screening in continued catalyst discovery campaigns, we introduce a durability descriptor based on the d-electron count of each metal element compared to that of its Pourbaix-stable oxidation state, which enables rapid down-selection of candidate metal oxide catalysts. We discuss the importance of a codesign approach to catalyst development, where a device architecture can set specific requirements for dissolved metals concentrations and/or cathode and anode catalysts can be designed to tolerate cross-contamination. This devicelevel guidance of basic science will facilitate deployment of new catalysts to meet the societal needs for accelerated sustainable technology development. ■ INTRODUCTION The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is central to emerging and future technologies such as electrolyzers for H2 production, 3,4 photoelectrochemical generation of carbonand nitrogencontaining fuels and chemicals, and air-breathing batteries. We outline the challenges for OER catalyst discovery in acidic electrolytes, which stand in stark contrast to alkaline electrolytes where there is little room to improve upon the stateof-the-art nonprecious metal catalysts with respect to isolated OER catalyst metrics. These most commonly reported metrics include OER activity and the stability thereof, although catalyst performance must ultimately be considered in the context of a specific target technology and device design, which inherently impose additional considerations and constraints compared to generic catalyst discovery. While traditional catalyst development strives to identify catalysts that improve upon the generic metrics, overcoming technology deployment hurdles motivates rethinking the catalyst design process in the context of codesign. Codesign for catalysis research aims to generate scientific opportunities from device-level considerations and to facilitate translation of discovered catalysts into devices, thereby amplifying the impact of catalyst discovery efforts. Embodiments of the codesign strategy vary with domain, with the transcendent principle that end-user experiential knowledge should be incorporated throughout the design process; the end user of an electrocatalyst discovery effort is an electrochemical device incorporating the catalyst. Recent technologies developed via codesign include control systems and computing architectures where feedback ab initio from the end user disrupted the standard sequential design processes. For electrocatalyst design, codesign motivates development of catalyst discovery workflows based on input from prior data from device operation, multiphysics device models, and new device designs.

Catalyst codesign is not simply a reframing of traditional multiobjective optimization but rather a change in how multiobjective optimization is approached. Many catalyst discovery efforts fall under the umbrella of “use-inspired research”, which is commensurate with the codesign philosophy, but the latter is distinguished by the level of specificity in the “inspiration”, the disruption of the sequential design of a catalyst and its device implementation, and the development of methods to directly incorporate prior knowledge of device operation in catalyst design. In the present perspective article we do not demonstrate codesign research but rather frame its opportunity in the context of the state of the art for OER in alkaline and acidic electrolytes. To outline the challenges that may be addressed via codesign, we commence with the high-level considerations of electrolyte pH and catalyst scalability. Incorporation of bipolar membranes in electrochemical systems has enable the anodic OER reaction to occur in the desired alkaline electrolyte while the cathodic reaction occurs in its most suitable electrolyte, which ranges from near-neutral to acidic conditions for various technologies. The bipolar membrane introduces electrochemical potential losses and durability challenges that diminish the benefits of operating OER in alkaline electrolytes, motivating continued efforts to develop active, stable, and scalable OER catalysts for lower-pH operation. Regarding scalability, the viability of precious metal-based OER catalysts for scalable technologies is debatable, motivating concepts such as atomically thin coatings and single-atom sites to attempt to address the global scarcity of precious metals. So far, such catalysts have not been sufficient for commercialization, and their long-term durability is challenged by the fact that no catalyst is stable in the absence of dissolved metals species, which are necessary for establishing an equilibrium. The quest for durability is thus not one of eliminating all metal species from the electrolyte but rather finding a catalyst and operating condition where the equilibrium dissolved metals concentrations are not problematic for devicelevel durability. Fully evaluating these requirements must be done in the context of a specific device model, which would enable a more specific implementation of codesign; we present some examples in the Discussion. An open circuit electrochemical potential corresponds to the thermodynamic condition at which the forward and reverse reaction rates are equal. Analogously, catalyst stability at a given pH and potential concerns the equilibriummetal concentrations in electrolyte that yields equal rates of corrosion and precipitation, where the corrosion kinetics determine the rate as well as the time-scale of equilibration under a given operating condition, which varies with electrolyte volume and mass transport, e.g., static vs. recirculating electrolyte. The precipitated metals may experience different solid-state binding and are usually more stable and amorphous than their configuration prior to their corrosion. Catalysis research has historically underexplored the study of corrosion equilibration as a dynamic phenomenon that determines the long-term catalyst activity. Pourbaix energetics provide a bulk thermodynamic assessment of the stability of a material at a given electrochemical condition and dissolved metals concentrations, which is useful for comparison among different materials and operating conditions and establishing trends in operational stability. Here, we discuss the opportunities for transformative OER catalyst discoveries based on a combination of recent reports of nonprecious metal electrocatalysts as well as emerging computational and experimental tools that enable the community to reimagine the process for discovering catalysts for OER and other reactions. OER mechanisms, their pH dependence, and tailoring of electronic structure for improved OER activity have been recently reviewed, motivating our attention on assessing the activity and durability limitations of the state-ofthe-art in precious metal-free electrocatalysts and how they may be addressed with a codesign approach to catalyst discovery guided by the development of new descriptors for Pourbaix stability and OER activity. We highlight the opportunities to consider mutual compatibility of anode and cathode catalysts within a given device to focus discovery efforts on catalyst formulations with maximal downstream impact. ■ RESULTS The state-of-the-art and importance of codesign in OER catalyst discovery varies substantially with operation in alkaline, nearneutral, and acidic electrolytes. In near-neutral conditions, the breadth of the reported catalyst activity and stability is insufficient to establish the trends that we outline below for alkaline and acidic electrolytes. Briefly, cobalt-based catalysts are among the most active catalysts when electrodeposited from electrolytes containing phosphate, methylphosphonate, or borate, at pH from 7 to 9.2 to form the Co−Pi, Co−MePi, and Co−Bi OER catalyst families.

{"title": "Mutagenesis of DsbAss is Crucial for the Signal Recognition Particle Mechanism in Escherichia coli: Insights from Molecular Dynamics Simulations", "abstract": "The disulfide bond signal sequence (DsbAss) protein is characterized as an important virulence factor in gram-negative bacteria. This study aimed to analyze the “alanine” alteration in the hydrophobic (H) region of DsbAss and to understand the conformational DsbAss alteration(s) inside the fifty-four homolog (Ffh)-binding groove which were revealed to be crucial for translocation of ovine growth hormone (OGH) to the periplasmic space in Escherichia coli via the secretory (Sec) pathway. An experimental design was used to explore the hydrophobicity and alteration of alanine (Ala) to isoleucine (Ile) in the tripartite structure of DsbAss. As a result, two DsbAss mutants (Ala at positions -11 and -13) with same hydrophobicity of 1.539 led to the conflicting translocation of the active OGH gene. We performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and molecular mechanics generalized born surface area (MM-GBSA) binding free energy calculations to examine the interaction energetic and dynamic aspects of DsbAss/signal repetition particle 54 (SRP54) binding, which has a principle role in Escherichia coli Sec pathways. Although both DsbAss mutants retained helicity, the MD simulation analysis evidenced that altering Ala-13 changed the orientation of the signal peptide in the Ffh M binding domain groove, favored more stable interaction energies (MM-GBSA ΔGtotal = −140.62 kcal mol−1), and hampered the process of OGH translocation, while Ala-11 pointed outward due to unstable conformation and less binding energy (ΔGtotal = −124.24 kcal mol−1). Here we report the dynamic behavior of change of “alanine” in the H-domain of DsbAss which affects the process of translocation of OGH, where MD simulation and MM-GBSA can be useful initial tools to investigate the virulence of bacteria.", "authors": [{"name": "Faiza Gul Durrani", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Roquyya Gul", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "M.

{"title": "A Variational Approach to Parameter Estimation for Characterizing 2-D Cluster Variation Method Topographies", "abstract": "One of the biggest challenges in characterizing 2-D topographies is succinctly communicating the dominant nature of local configurations. In a 2-D grid composed of bistate units, this could be expressed as finding the characteristic configuration variables such as nearestneighbor pairs and triplet combinations. The 2-D cluster variation method (CVM) provides a theoretical framework for associating a set of configuration variables with only two parameters, for a system that is at free energy equilibrium. This work presents a method for determining which of many possible two-parameter sets provides the “most suitable” match for a given 2-D topography, drawing from methods used for variational inference. This particular work focuses exclusively on topographies for which the activation enthalpy parameter (ε0) is zero, so that the distribution between two states is equiprobable. This condition is used since, when the two states are equiprobable, there is an analytic solution giving the configuration variable values as functions of the h-value, where we define h in terms of the interaction enthalpy parameter (ε1) as h = exp(2ε1). This allows the computationally-achieved configuration variable values to be compared with the analytically-predicted values for a given h-value. The method is illustrated using four patterns derived from three different naturally-occurring black-and-white topographies, where each pattern meets the equiprobability criterion. We achieve expected results, that is, as the patterns progress from having relatively low numbers of like-near-like nodes to increasing like-near-like masses, the h-values for each corresponding free energyminimized model also increase. Further, the corresponding configuration variable values for the (free energy-minimized) model patterns are in close alignment with the analytically-predicted values. The method described here has applicability beyond characterizing specific 2-D topographies. Potential applications extend to active inference as well as to 2-D CORTECONs, which incorporate free energy minimization into a 2-D grid of latent variables, in addition to the usual methods employed with energy-based neural networks.", "authors": [{"name": "A.

We confirmed the resting state and catalytic active species of this stoichiometric reaction, and we calculated the full catalytic cycle to obtain a favorable reaction pathway. The DFT calculation results indicate that the morphology of the active species is essential for the observed concerted metalation/deprotonation step. Although C-H activation is reversible in principle, it is the regioselectivity- or product-determining step. Our calculation results show that the regioselectivity is not only influenced by the electron effects but also by the potential steric repulsion interactions between the substrates and the specific geometry of the catalyst. Interestingly, the transmetalation process involves the largest overall change in free energy; thus, transmetalation is defined as the rate-determining step and turnover-determining step.", "authors": [{"name": "Chaoyu Zhao", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Siwei Yang", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Yaxuan Cheng", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Ruxin Qu", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Xuri Huang", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Huiling Liu", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2021, "doi": "10.1021/acs.joc.1c01160", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": "bad951a5bf8c38f3941b6356dca832c225e2bf6b", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "Journal of Organic Chemistry", "citation_count": 2, "references": [], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Large deviations of semisupervised learning in the stochastic block model.", "abstract": "In semisupervised community detection, the membership of a set of revealed nodes is known in addition to the graph structure and can be leveraged to achieve better inference accuracies. While previous works investigated the case where the revealed nodes are selected at random, this paper focuses on correlated subsets leading to atypically high accuracies. In the framework of the dense stochastic block model, we employ statistical physics methods to derive a large deviation analysis of the number of these rare subsets, as characterized by their free energy. We find theoretical evidence of a nonmonotonic relationship between reconstruction accuracy and the free energy associated to the posterior measure of the inference problem. We further discuss possible implications for active learning applications in community detection.", "authors": [{"name": "Hugo Cui", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Luca Saglietti", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Lenka Zdeborov'a", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2021, "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevE.105.034108", "arxiv_id": "2108.00847", "s2_id": "ea1d129b883ec48ce7efe122908e80fc52cba05c", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "Physical Review E", "citation_count": 1, "references": ["s2:c7b8ff657e54fbdca842ddcf7de0722b56d1acd6", "s2:589a9140f68b800686e0100e2bd6b1b6e3c813db", "s2:7972dfe4ac29dedde2984601bf3505127dac3c72", "s2:0dab09eafa8b3709f0aa81a10136aff78c2733d5", "s2:0273507eb05f1135f3a05f9c7adc9a56f12c7c5c", "s2:82841efaeed40df2a3f412dcebfdabe5ac1005c5", "s2:36fcce38197985e5900613ff4bb49a980d342ae3", "s2:847c98c3e89e58d45a03a483f37059e22bc08cff", "s2:1c0354fe7653ec6b3df0241752537f45a93dd501", "s2:fe0a2b8a83dedf30196435144cad203b43d03d5d", "s2:85741399caed2225174eee134732f78a098c3fc1", "s2:db43d557fcfa7d6d43d9e8ea37d4327c6f421cbd", "s2:f982283a06fd83f48e46c0f869db28675de58e21", "s2:0a063d1ec630a7cecaad253c34f190cc2db2241e", "s2:3e81f8381e64fb8eead42225346df19e2da78111", "s2:998086d6d735fe7df6569bb3d570e112f84c0057", "s2:fb9ef4969e7dc92fe67851b5488d0cb7d206b19c", "s2:98c5afa2c7a3130ed0788aa1d5be1d62a9b10eca", "s2:98325a897d4f5031d055b0790c2bcbb3e23ba66d", "s2:ef23758a5ab26e0ae71d8a50174d8780414f57bd", "s2:dd308eb0d7be24e593fe355476057fc37ab5bf0e", "s2:23d51d102bd8643a4162f17f798d5d0e204bff04", "s2:846aedd869a00c09b40f1f1f35673cb22bc87490", "s2:855c8e5e3f69a1e7bd48b58e1dffd98efb6092d5", "s2:5ac3a7c7d9ef2157007bb3b8652eccfc89956ba0", "s2:599e769b65ab64f247926f38c9c080c45a12271a", "s2:82753512917eb9d77a28047870c867e0e02ed069", "s2:758569ef6c530fb8dc980d790786827b0f58b8cc", "s2:2b9e67a41a3139bbe451fecf27b524434facbc83", "s2:1c57c6ca21118b2b1c6ca9138dde495704aa69ec", "s2:e30318f3060890c474eaedef1fef126cdca58bff", "s2:b7e674d91601c46b5ab2c2530ff272753f2fe6ab", "s2:6cf06d1abc900c29bbc090af2467f3c8a60593d8", "s2:5949d98154a838055ba98996ea6afe2b69a9619f", "s2:5b90e8cd40146269a721e87f77f7adaf8b7d3e69", "s2:29c609c6c95b13fdb1b8fcc9991573bd6704d565", "s2:d6df29390c678eff7f03a28bfd2c85bbf6a16d07", "s2:ccb92d481c5438d88d860584edefd1f04be05ed2", "s2:4e108f9eefc36525e121c236234d9658c7aa9bbe", "s2:3694c24f93f8ab31570abb73dc9e081f570f2404", "s2:280e863e57e10c8501c67c5cad7f159d6c730571", "s2:5625bbaf7dfdf5b675c5213c917939870b5aa0a2", "s2:49db0fd3b64d03531255e2bdb80ae747d8fe0ffb", "s2:970aaabc08387dcdec1f1bf9eb109e98eb278211", "s2:da1377125fdc46712587541532d189620d35a17e", "s2:18593937ce0ac401f1c0327294722bfafbed899f", "s2:29ae02d79e885e46e3a77238da0073b22fde7264", "s2:9305ce9f90f98993ed3d4142f91f6a90c43808fb", "s2:9be428c9383d47b86570b1b9fc20faf006346c5d", "s2:547e0f6948e69115d3c7df39243eea660ba0dbc4", "s2:35eea69b5e62d0be05605257b9bb7885e8c27b79", "s2:04930dc2847e67b992219b129311523cb33976d5", "s2:2a91c8ff11a828209f10714cfc46fd929a51e9dc", "s2:8a2305b3867547c1da624b06b5a45143cf531c4c", "s2:11a4b3474f62299482c12e5159a10fcf00d44e48", "s2:194b9ceaf7b4246eeb9123049304d26c779c2215", "s2:1384d42b8df88bab0ce38c21144e154d1afed238", "s2:a8797f1d253c75669d96e6fcceda2be3f8534e1d", "s2:3b3b54848c1bc6ffea2625ce79302abed8e8deb9", "s2:5194b668c67aa83c037e71599a087f63c98eb713", "s2:80aa9c12d315734073d8db0b60a1b67fce98746b", "s2:7a95d7e379fcad3ecadabe48c79e61fdc7811af1", "s2:7789158665db67295e2758aa4b1c11c3372f0e31", "s2:941ef255d31b5becbf0a3281bcf7ac0122e4c833", "s2:65d3c09ba1b660de1bda83de31ef96d2c69d474a", "s2:24053f79a7235907d93f6cdfb4360055b11b8d4c", "s2:5be98a5a3b9b5a506e5c767bce263650d357dea2", "s2:7e48365ae017200d453b28c976136a3f14792b08", "s2:26c3d8228004029ad85156edd58dbc0dc05c8969", "s2:996263c3ddbb50f0198354827445abd214f83030", "s2:8d7491d5ebad102f3e0aec8dc868857f33eb9670", "s2:aa1db48c1adc5e99e356b435bee64684093f208b", "s2:e4374a69c18e263450130a1c8cbda92f6be7e64d", "s2:a2ea14dc3f89e5f28612f33ccac471c4cdd719a2", "s2:b9164335be5808ddd59786869a9f992331af5218", "s2:2b7ca8b15d4ce4f97738c65814123b06eb3d0b03", "s2:f07c9a3f1b5b509418c29074a436bc588e7895ee", "s2:9b780b1d0ddf62249c407ee9a07dd7622575e266", "s2:3d2218b17e7898a222e5fc2079a3f1531990708f", "s2:818826f356444f3daa3447755bf63f171f39ec47", "s2:f9fdd4005b6c8cfa6426fd5321fb0952cc711b70", "s2:0df1aac45ff562089a3bdbcb34e2481a71478651", "s2:310cfa8ebe987b4e0a6c4f361f7e0dbd34dda615", "s2:b3c19172a59922fa7cbed8f09f30ed3a1ea74b4e", "s2:e16333259bb4a688fe2568f0d757299846a3e696", "s2:a96d481911bd25cbfcd58a947db7e69780fab55f"], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Predictive codes of interoception, emotion, and the self", "abstract": "Interoception is the ability to perceive and integrate physiological signals from within the body. It is closely related to the autonomic system and is a key component in the generation of affective states and abstract representations of the self (Critchley et al., 2004; Ainley and Tsakiris, 2013). Seth proposes a predictive coding (PC) model of interoception that involves a free-energy based explanation of emotion awareness and selfhood. In this model, emotions, and in turn the sense of self, rely on predictions of the causes of interoceptive signals. Within this framework, the interoceptive system minimizes free-energy, or the discrepancy between predictions and interoceptive signals. Free-energy can be minimized either by updating predictions about the causes of the sensory signals (perceptual updating), or by acting to change autonomic states such that bodily states are more predictable (active inference).", "authors": [{"name": "A.

{"title": "Cobalt−Tetracyanoquinodimethane Monolayer as Efficient Bi-Functional Single Atom Electrocatalyst: A First Principles Investigation", "abstract": "\n A bi-functional electrocatalyst is a stable and catalytically active material for both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the development of which is highly challenging, although essential for application in fuel cells. Herein, the first principle based density functional theory (DFT) computations have been carried out to investigate a series of transition metal-tetracyanoquinodimethane (TM-TCNQ: TM = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd) monolayer for bi-functional single atom electrocatalyst towards ORR and OER. Amongst various first transition metal row based TCNQ substrates, Cobalt-TCNQ (Co-TCNQ) monolayer was predicted to exhibit best bi-functional catalytic activity. At equilibrium potential (1.23 V, vs RHE), the free energy portraits of Co-TCNQ monolayer for OER in acidic or alkaline media are not completely downhill, measuring an excess potential of 0.6 V, equal to the overpotential, which is needed to be supplied externally to promote the OER activity. On the other hand, an onset potentials of 0.34 V (vs RHE) in acidic media are measured for ORR to proceed. The promising catalytic activity of two dimensional Co-TCNQ monolayer towards ORR and OER as revealed by DFT investigations has been explained in terms of density of states and Bader charge analysis.", "authors": [{"name": "B.

{"title": "On the Learnability of Physical Concepts: Can a Neural Network Understand What's Real?", "abstract": "We revisit the classic signal-to-symbol barrier in light of the remarkable ability of deep neural networks to generate realistic synthetic data. DeepFakes and spoofing highlight the feebleness of the link between physical reality and its abstract representation, whether learned by a digital computer or a biological agent. Starting from a widely applicable definition of abstract concept, we show that standard feed-forward architectures cannot capture but trivial concepts, regardless of the number of weights and the amount of training data, despite being extremely effective classifiers. On the other hand, architectures that incorporate recursion can represent a significantly larger class of concepts, but may still be unable to learn them from a finite dataset. We qualitatively describe the class of concepts that can be\"understood\"by modern architectures trained with variants of stochastic gradient descent, using a (free energy) Lagrangian to measure information complexity. Even if a concept has been understood, however, a network has no means of communicating its understanding to an external agent, except through continuous interaction and validation. We then characterize physical objects as abstract concepts and use the previous analysis to show that physical objects can be encoded by finite architectures. However, to understand physical concepts, sensors must provide persistently exciting observations, for which the ability to control the data acquisition process is essential (active perception). The importance of control depends on the modality, benefiting visual more than acoustic or chemical perception.

In active inference, instrumental or extrinsic value is quantified by the information-theoretic surprisal of a set of observations measuring the extent to which those observations conform to prior beliefs or preferences.

For reinforcement learning tasks, the distribution of preferences replaces the notion of reward. We explore a scenario in which the agent learns this distribution in a self-supervised manner. In particular, we highlight the distinction between observations induced by the environment and those pertaining more directly to the continuity of an agent in time.

Motivated by a naturalistic reading of Thomas Kuhn's insights into the same topic, I draw on cognitive neuroscience (predictive coding under Free Energy Principle) to scrutinise theory-ladenness.

Various computational studies of the different isomers are carried out at the complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) level of theory in addition to the B3LYP level in conjunction with the 6-311++G(d) basis set. The potential energy surfaces linking the different isomers through transition states and conical intersections are investigated at the CASSCF level, connecting various geometrical isomers of Be32-. The linear intermediate of the Be32- cluster is considered to be of profound importance since its excited state is found to be degenerate and undergoing the Renner-Teller effect, producing two triangular bond stretch isomers. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations based on the Atom Centered Density Matrix Propagation (ADMP) method also further elucidate the phenomenon of isomerization via the linear intermediate.

{"title": "Doping Induced Enhancement of Activity and Stability for Oxygen Evolution Reaction with Isomaterially Heterostructured MnO2", "abstract": "A “Non-Native” phase (NNP) differs from the thermodynamically most stable bulk Native in its discrete translational symmetry. The relative difference in surface and bulk energy with respect to the native phase (NP)determines the stability of NNP. The isomaterial hetero-structured NP-NNP composite provides a pathway to assemble structures that have optimal properties of NNP and NP. The surface and sub-surface energies can also be modulated by doping as the dopants may segregate and stabilize grain boundaries. This study demonstrates that the isomaterial heterostructure of the NP, β-N MnO2, and Ramsdellite, r-NN1 MnO2, known as γ-N-NN1-MnO2 intergrowth, enhances the OER activity and stability.\n The hydrothermal route was used to synthesize isomaterial heterostructured γ/N-NN1-MnO2 with varying concentrations of dopants (10%, 15%, and 20% Ni and Co). X-ray diffraction was used to characterize the material, and after Rietveld refinement, phase quantification revealed that as the dopant concentration increased, the amount of the thermodynamically stable β-N MnO2 phase increased. Planes identified in XRD were also confirmed using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and the analysis of selective area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns. It appears that doping was successful based on the shifting of peaks in XRD and differences in unit cell volume and crystallite size calculated using the Debye-Scherrer equation before and after doping. With an increase in dopant concentration and thus improved OER activity, the average oxidation state as determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy followed a downward trend, which is known to improve OER activity. The peaks shifted to lower frequency values as seen by Raman spectroscopy, which implies a weakening of Mn—O bond strength, indicating that dopants Ni and Co may have replaced part of the Mn atoms in the MnO2 intergrowth structure. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed spherical-shaped nanoparticles with spike-like overgrowths, which were further confirmed by HRTEM. The uniform dispersion of dopants was demonstrated by SEM and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Elemental quantification of the samples was done using EDS and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Using HRTEM, the presence of grain boundaries was confirmed.\n The study of dopants segregating to the grain boundary is conducted through DFT simulations. In many instances, the dopants actively contribute to the OER activity, except for the case of Ni in the NN1 sub-phase of the γ-N-NN1-MnO2 intergrowth, which is apparent by the slightly lower activity of Ni-doped samples compared to Co. This is because Ni remains in the bulk while Co segregates to the surface. A three-electrode setup (Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, Pt mesh as the counter electrode, and catalyst as the working electrode) was used in 1M KOH to conduct electrochemical experiments. To achieve 10 mA/cm2, the 15% Co-doped electrocatalyst used the least amount of overpotential, 320 mV. According to electrochemical measurements and analysis, the doped samples show low Tafel slope, high specific activity, roughness factor, and charge transfer resistance from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, all of which suggest improved overall activity for the oxygen evolution process (OER) for the doped over undoped samples.

{"title": "The Gravity of Objects: How Affectively Organized Generative Models Influence Perception and Social Behavior", "abstract": "Friston’s (2010) free energy principle (FEP) offers an opportunity to rethink what is meant by the psychoanalytic concept of an object or discrete mental representation (Ogden, 1992). The significance of such objects in psychoanalysis is that they may be superimposed on current experience so that perceptions are partly composed of projected fantasy and partly of more realistic perception. From a free energy perspective, the psychoanalytic (person) object may be understood as a bounded set of prior beliefs about a “platonic” sort of person that provides a free energy minimizing, evidence maximizing, hypothesis to explain inference about – or dyadic interactions with – another. The degree to which realistic perception supervenes – relative to a platonic person object – will depend upon the precision assigned to the sensory evidence (concerning the person) relative to the prior beliefs about a platonic form. This provides a basis for not only explaining projection and transference phenomena but also conceptualizing a central assumption within the object relations psychoanalysis. As an example, the paper examines the Kleinian theory of split good or bad part objects as affectively organized generative models (or platonic part-object models) formed in early infancy. This also provides a basis for building on work by Kernberg (1984, 1996) by conceptualizing the role of the part object(s) in a continuum of reality testing, from mild errors in perception that are relatively easily corrected, through borderline affective instability and frequent shifts between part-object experience, to psychotic failures of reality testing, where Friston et al. (2016) proposed that aberrant precisions bias perception to high precision false beliefs (here cast as platonic part objects), such as stable perceptions of others (and possibly oneself) as persecutory agents of some sort. The paper demonstrates the value that the history of clinical insights into psychoanalysis (including object relations) and a system-based approach to the brain (including the free energy principle) can have for one another. This is offered as a demonstration of the potential value of an “Integrative Clinical Systems Psychology” proposed by Tretter and Lo¨ffler-Stastka (2018), which has the potential to integrate the major theoretical frameworks in the field today.", "authors": [{"name": "P.

This equality relates the free energy differences between two equilibrium thermodynamic states with the work performed when going between those states, through an average over a path ensemble. \nIn this work the analysis of Jarzynski's equality will be performed using the formalism of inference over path space.

{"title": "Disclinations and GND tensor effects on the multislip flow rule in crystal plasticity", "abstract": "This paper deals with new elastoplastic models for crystalline materials with microstructural defects, such as dislocations and disclinations, which are consistent with the multislip plastic flow rule, and compatible with the free energy imbalance principle. The defect free energy function is a function of the disclination tensor and its gradient, and of the geometrically necessary dislocation (GND) tensor, via the Cartan torsion. By applying the free energy imbalance, the appropriate viscoplastic (diffusion-like) evolution equations are derived for shear plastic rates (in slip systems) and for the disclination tensor. The two sets of differential (or partial differential, i.e., non-local) equations describe the rate form of the adopted disclination–dislocation model. The first set is typical for finite deformation formalism, while the second set refers to the evolution equations with respect to the reference configuration. The dislocation appears to be a source for producing disclination defects. A pure dislocation elastoplastic model is also proposed. Multislip models with disclination within the small deformation approach are derived from the finite deformation models. The initial and boundary value problems are formulated and the incremental (rate) equilibrium equation leads to a variational equality for the velocity field, at any time, which is coupled with the rate type models for the set of variables. First, the elastic problem is solved for a certain time interval by assuming that the existing defects inside the body remain inactive. Subsequently, the variational equality is solved for the velocity field, at any time, if the slip systems are activated. Consequently, the state of the body with defects is defined by the solution of the differential-type equations, when the velocity field is known for a certain time interval. Appropriate initial conditions are necessary, including those associated with defects which became active. Finally, an update algorithm must be provided in order to compute the fields at the current moment.", "authors": [{"name": "S.

{"title": "Insights into the mechanism of Arnebia euchroma on leukemia via network pharmacology approach", "abstract": "Background Arnebia euchroma (A. euchroma) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) used for the treatment of blood diseases including leukemia. In recent years, many studies have been conducted on the anti-tumor effect of shikonin and its derivatives, the major active components of A. euchroma . However, the underlying mechanism of action (MoA) for all the components of A. euchroma on leukemia has not been explored systematically. Methods In this study, we analyzed the MoA of A. euchroma on leukemia via network pharmacology approach. Firstly, the chemical components and their concentrations in A. euchroma as well as leukemia-related targets were collected. Next, we predicted compound-target interactions (CTIs) with our balanced substructure-drug-target network-based inference (bSDTNBI) method. The known and predicted targets of A. euchroma and leukemia-related targets were merged together to construct A. euchroma -leukemia protein-protein interactions (PPIs) network. Then, weighted compound-target bipartite network was constructed according to combination of eight central attributes with concentration information through Cytoscape. Additionally, molecular docking simulation was performed to calculate whether the components and predicted targets have interactions or not. Results A total of 65 components of A. euchroma were obtained and 27 of them with concentration information, which were involved in 157 targets and 779 compound-target interactions (CTIs). Following the calculation of eight central attributes of targets in A. euchroma -leukemia PPI network, 37 targets with all central attributes greater than the median values were selected to construct the weighted compound-target bipartite network and do the KEGG pathway analysis. We found that A. euchroma candidate targets were significantly associated with several apoptosis and inflammation-related biological pathways, such as MAPK signaling, PI3K-Akt signaling, IL-17 signaling, and T cell receptor signaling pathways. Moreover, molecular docking simulation demonstrated that there were eight pairs of predicted CTIs had the strong binding free energy. Conclusions This study deciphered that the efficacy of A. euchroma in the treatment of leukemia might be attributed to 10 targets and 14 components, which were associated with inhibiting leukemia cell survival and inducing apoptosis, relieving inflammatory environment and inhibiting angiogenesis.", "authors": [{"name": "Biting Wang", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Zengrui Wu", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Jiye Wang", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Weihua Li", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Guixia Liu", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Bo Zhang", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Yun Tang", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1186/s12906-020-03106-z", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": "7589f675504a5e7b217bec0ebb89bf4377981f7b", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "BMC Complementary Medicine and Therapies", "citation_count": 11, "references": ["s2:3390a1ebad37ab07be15be45492988d754df0284", "s2:47b144682b7885cf413d796fd855a8e0d875b40b", "s2:ba4b8663d07dfd144a42c0cce468ccf85028a435", "s2:a0a4e2f8887e758aff0d6fc7e00fe96a2dcb255d", "s2:980f1e89c2abcd446978b0ebd2cedee638e9c9f8", "s2:2a38b12ac11caa5d209ea9b06a59b15e5139d61b", "s2:0c46f96d3f051a3aa787bf96346ac6fb9f885534", "s2:bb58e1bb0bd29179ecd956cd3d66f3853e94e85f", "s2:cc5c5adfc0635ac91bc8992eeb70395984d68cff", "s2:d18772847095c7cb0af9f4f3f9629107468c1461", "s2:647c574e416017415ce37dea5e5a5318ec30561c", "s2:e9e36d0c726216f8da64d79990a9183a2821c6e1", "s2:d90be3a3e25393fa58ff4ba314c2e17e31348144", "s2:ab723f82e9410a3d934a5dded95a898b983a497a", "s2:11f00c7c1774226c1912037c7fcd25a29bf6d2c7", "s2:9f8dbb4aef6b3dd0b0725efe2fe3cbc610f8918b", "s2:bbbc500e14cff1bf82869f2ae50d51426f43c860", "s2:7c6e97b524a417912414b35812421cfe3e1755b2", "s2:89a276dbda44aaf6e776039fb2175e203bbece08", "s2:3a16e578e5a7a6bafb3de878d6e382fa6f25767e", "s2:53ce6c125c932409239f4ac8c984cf48b4b3b01f", "s2:e629b3185dc9b7b0db957eea7c97a5f6caf64bbf", "s2:d71af418eeb9f5a68062929bae12af74773ffcb2", "s2:9de14710600e4a33d2b006772c5179e80f711d15", "s2:936b66318975320562f0c8c1cc6a327ad4d46419", "s2:b76144f714027fbb6d78334e48674ee9244947f9", "s2:d4921d6c5dfd0741026028745b63b450e4e81cd1", "s2:47f469403148e1e92f0cbf1539ebe3425fada5d2", "s2:3b7f4962786c088b23920e33e9cb464cdb20ab70", "s2:50c1d39f4039adaf9d9dc4ac37022dc91836d7ff", "s2:0385bd4ff935f7d369028d3f936df2e1955af4bc", "s2:4abbeb95f252bf5478987de5ad60b524b530b2d5", "s2:d8afbe41149ccfda31c88f706289caa918fed383", "s2:b11b644b2dc4da5b4bad596d6ce669b9159beb28", "s2:add03e97b95774df59d84e8554e489da519302d8", "s2:4160f91c5469b6e5cd021d258ce3f425351e9f26", "s2:df05c37e2552640ead8cc16715f38559cf5245cb", "s2:bf6750fc66c4790c96f2f55a5b024979348749fb", "s2:cbd6da32638320a412647d8e1f2609995731507e", "s2:76883c8a18f0b58d486b6dc0fdb9331f3bda6360", "s2:2b03918fa5f740b0113c64caeaebf91c79a8858b", "s2:affd1dee2c682e3da51ba2e5f348ec027f9acdbb", "s2:7d164b87512ebef611b3d2e41f73a8cb51fe0388", "s2:94e137340499dc19afca4b1d9832cf07d3b846a2", "s2:c56dd76981c4518f0b9d641c199371e97123c2f6", "s2:2334a61f16ac3d2b343d2405d6596797af553ae6", "s2:205eb581c213d2ba4674d995c68edb6972a8c95d", "s2:41719acc7e98359e396acfe08216a3a07baf0347", "s2:32bbe6753ed68c1567c09c32c24ff83b9b067d76", "s2:ac6cccaf32375b5f06a58e1a99148fc22b7c454c", "s2:431fa03452ea57e9cb3b1b299fa667058190cbf0", "s2:6e3c6029ad3d2e410b826899f6e143bca50f60a4", "s2:4ca7dfd72791838607272a5f56f93dbd321e15d3", "s2:45c1d83775038164894078a9f7061f56bc12470d", "s2:e86cad49ca90659f1701dfa411ac48f49d166b5a", "s2:73e76358965bcadf6a1e23a9ca2b4f4c99a7e925", "s2:efbf4f52baa861c8516cbf36dd53720b6a37a62c", "s2:ad03182361fbf36aec2033491789b8ddb8170f39", "s2:fd95d929a5e16e3fcb75d14f6ac3404a8cedf683", "s2:ccc0b6f2b9edab2d9515dce3983088de302fa0b1", "s2:9912f2d5a77b7cde1f33d674b0087d26db0d747e", "s2:562a0a0f9dd348cb29c3193d568392cd34d79e1c", "s2:6e0408e88c74c633abd622c4a9a74472b4575594", "s2:74c6933fcf86320e2f124342969c9e470f96f453", "s2:7a07c1a9911d63e50b7789b650fee4554f7659be", "s2:ebcf45326675a9a34d3f6e9662f23a9bc3602a7e", "s2:2a8e02479c6d37a9e56b3cac5e80dc4ba2e4dc21", "s2:f55310bca7906ae20827c479108acfd04c68e07e", "s2:ee22e7291210f0e9c9cf757a9e300ea507c9429a", "s2:59954722cbacf47da6391cd384cd98f18043d897", "s2:806b8cb607c678667ea261e868bc14890ef53b18", "s2:07a1c0b32cf0c31d4db7b49509da8aee29d48c9c", "s2:18fe61beb67b6c05eb49a2d4f1ca6ff5d3bb9a65", "s2:2d03699fd1f0adb0590582a8ae11475554eabfb8", "s2:01062eb7cd50973e472c35a82f68d2c091603f88", "s2:37f457a2a2f5da1d9bca357affd2b2441b55ab68", "s2:5f8b3d4cbc5d9519727f143f6f4222f95120c1e9", "s2:8e884ecc770cc8705f211ffca263ba120fee125a", "s2:74d2909b2e8131b4ef944e29f865959e521109b0", "s2:498e161cff90ee847784a1116ea74fe1daac37ee", "s2:34b9635d7779e219e9d60e0d3d33919ca9bc123c", "s2:3d32a19f41caf9276945c679e3aaa1829bc57186"], "publication_date": null}

The calculations have taken place under consideration of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of the density functional theory (DFT) with using the plane-wave ab initio pseudopotential method. According to the calculations, the major contribution to electronic states at the Fermi energy has been achieved by d orbitals, revealing a more active role for transition metals Ir (Rh) and Sc atoms. The reckonings point out that the Ir2ScGa and Rh2ScGa have metallic behavior at the equilibrium lattice constant with the density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level (N (EF)) of 1.412 states/eV and 1.821 states/eV, respectively. The results of the elastic constants showed that these compounds met the criteria for Born mechanical stability. It was also observed that they have a ductile structure and exhibit anisotropic behavior according to Pugh criteria. Besides, the full phonon spectra and their projected partial density of states of the alloys have been analyzed with the first-principle linear-response approach of the density-functional perturbation theory. All the alloys behaved dynamically stable in the L21 phase. Furthermore, internal free energy, entropy, specific heat capacity at constant volume and vibrational free energy changes of Ir2ScGa and Rh2ScGa alloys were analyzed and discussed between the temperature range of 0 -800 K using the quasi harmonic approximation. According to the results, these alloys are potential candidate for industrial use.", "authors": [{"name": "M.

{"title": "Investigating the Catalytic Molecular Details of Malonyl‐thioester Decarboxylating Enzymes", "abstract": "Decarboxylation reactions release the free energy necessary for carbon‐carbon bond formation in the biosynthesis of polyketides and fatty acids. Ketosynthases from fatty acid and polyketide synthases perform a decarboxylative Claisen‐condensation between an acyl‐thioester intermediate and a malonyl‐derived extender unit. However, the molecular details of decarboxylation and C‐C bond formation is not well understood. We are synthesizing and characterizing non‐hydrolyzable and non‐decarboxylatable substrate mimics to capture intermediate catalytic states via X‐ray crystallography. Capturing the substrate mimics in the active site of ketosynthases will yield insight into the mechanism of decarboxylation and polymerization of the two carbon units. Decarboxylation reactions are essentially non‐reversible and have various possible chemical mechanisms, which makes them difficult to study. Ketosynthases are also challenging to study due to their multiple substrates and need for protein‐protein interactions. Therefore, we have begun characterization of our substrate mimics with simpler systems, such as malonyl‐ and methylmalonyl‐CoA decarboxylases (MCD and MMCD), as a proof of principle. We have successfully crystallized E. coli MMCD and the bifunctional acyltransferase/decarboxylase, LnmK, with our substrate mimics. Our substrate mimics preserve the thioester carbonyl as a thioester, ester or amide and have a nitro or sulfonate moiety in place of the carboxylate. Structures of MMCD and LnmK with multiple bound substrate mimics reveals mechanistic insight into decarboxylation. While MMCD and LnmK have no sequence homology to ketosynthases, this study reveals that our substrate mimics indeed inhibit decarboxylation reactions. Therefore, we are beginning to apply this concept to ketosynthases from type III polyketide synthases.", "authors": [{"name": "L.

{"title": "A theoretical and computational study of the active self-organization of nematic patterns in thin cytoskeletal layers and their effect on curvature", "abstract": "(English)The structure and dynamics of important biological systems, ranging from cytoskeletal gels to tissues, are controlled by an interplay between activity, dissipation, nematic order, density, and geometry. In particular, the actin cytoskeleton is remarkably adaptable and versatile and self-organizes into a variety of architectures, notably dense nematic structures. Examples of such structures are contractile rings to accomplish cell division and wound healing, or stress fibers playing an essential role in cell spreading, force generation, and migration. However, the mechanisms leading to dense nematic bundles remain poorly understood and to our knowledge, no prior theory explains their mesoscale self-assembly. Previous hydrodynamic approaches to active nematic systems have focused on incompressible liquid crystals. However, these models are not pertinent to actin gels, which are highly porous and exhibit very large density variations controlling activity gradients and active flows. Furthermore, porous actin networks can exhibit extended isotropic states without defects, and nematic order is presumably induced by flows and active mechanisms rather than by crowding. Finally, little attention has been paid to the formulation of active nematics on deformable surfaces and to a general computational framework to address such complex problems. Finally, we lack a unified understanding of actin network polymorphism, and more specifically of the physical mechanisms that enable a single active material to adopt very different network architectures with distinct cellular functions. To address these challenges, we develop a variety of theoretical and computational models for active nematic gels. In part I of the thesis, we focus on active nematic gels confined to a plane. We develop a transparent modeling framework for density-dependent active nemato-hydrodynamics based on Onsager’s variational formalism, according to which the dynamics result from a competition between free-energy release, dissipation and activity. We also develop a numerical finite element method based on a time-incremental version of Onsager's formalism, which inherits the nonlinear stability and thermodynamic consistency of the continuum principle. We use this numerical approach to study the assembly of a contractile ring during wound healing and the defect dynamics in a confined colony of contractile cells. We next study the active self-assembly of nematic patterns from a uniform and quiescent gel using linearized theory and nonlinear simulations. We establish the conditions for nematic bundle formation and how active gel parameters control the architecture, connectivity and dynamics of self-organized patterns of nematic bundles. Finally, using discrete \nnetwork simulations, we substantiate the major requirements for active nematic self-organization according to our theory. We thus provide a framework to understand the emergence and dynamics of mesoscale nematic organizations in actin networks. In part II of the thesis, we develop a general model for active nematic gels on deformable surfaces. Again, Onsager's nonlinear formalism provides a simple method to transparently develop complex models. The resulting system tight couples shape dynamics, nematic dynamics, density dynamics, and interfacial hydrodynamics. We exercise this model to understand the self-organization of the cytokinetic ring using an axisymmetric numerical formulation. Finally, we provide a general 3D computational approach and apply it to an inextensible active liquid crystalline deformable surface. We examine the interplay between the motion of nematic defects and shape.\n (Català) L’estructura i dinàmica de sistemes biològics importants, des de gels citoesquelètics fins a teixits, estan controlades per la interacció entre activitat, dissipació, ordre nemàtic, densitat i geometria. En concret, el citoesquelet d’actina és remarcablement adaptable i versàtil i s’autoorganitza en diverses arquitectures, notablement en estructures de nemàtica densa. Alguns exemples d’aquestes estructures són anells contràctils per assolir divisió cellular i cicatrització de ferides, o fibres estressades amb un rol essencial pel que fa a propagació cel·lular, generació de forces i migració. Tanmateix, els mecanismes que condueixen a aquests farcells de nemàtica densa encara no estan ben compresos i, fins on saben, no existeix cap teoria prèvia que expliqui la seva autoorganització a escala mesoscòpica. Enfocaments hidrodinàmics previs per a sistemes nemàtics actius s’han centrat en cristalls líquids incompressibles. No obstant això, aquests models no són pertinents pel que fa a gels d’actina, els quals tenen una gran porositat i mostren una gran variació de densitats que controlen gradients d’activitat i fluxos actius. A més, les xarxes d’actina porosa poden mostrar extensos estats isotròpics sense defectes, i l’ordre nemàtic està induït presumptament per fluxos i mecanismes actius que no pas per amuntegament. Finalment, no s’ha parat gaire atenció a la formulació d’actius nemàtics en superfícies deformables i a un marc general computacional per fer front a aquesta mena de problemes complexos. Finalment, ens falta una entesa uniforme del polimorfisme de xarxes d’actina, específicament dels mecanismes físics que permeten a un sol material actiu d’adoptar diferents arquitectures de xarxes amb diversitat de funcions cellulars.Per fer front a aquests desafiaments, desenvolupem una varietat de models teòrics i computacions per gels actius nemàtics. A la part I de la tesi, ens centren en gels actius nemàtics confinats al pla. Desenvolupem un marc transparent de delització per hidrodinàmiques actives nemàtiques amb dependència de la densitat basades en el formalisme variacional d’Onsager, segons el qual les dinàmiques sorgeixen d’una competició entre l’alliberament d’energia lliure, dissipació i activitat. També hem desenvolupat un mètode numèric d’elements finits basat en la versió d’increment temporal del formalisme d’Onsager, el qual hereta l’estabilitat no linear i la consistència termodinàmica del principi continu. Fem servir aquest enfocament numèric per estudiar el muntatge d’anells contràctils durant la cicatrització i les dinàmiques de defectes en una colònia confinada de cèl·lules contràctils. Després estudiem l’automuntatge actiu de patrons nemàtics d’un gel uniforme i quiescent fen servir teoria linealitzada i simulacions no linears. Establim les condicions per a la formació de farcells nemàtics i com els paràmetres del gel actiu controlen l’arquitectura, connectivitat i dinàmiques de patrons autoorganitzats de farcells nemàtics. Finalment, fent servir xarxes de simulacions discretes, justifiquem els requisits majors per a una autoorganització activa i nemàtica d’acord amb la nostra teoria. També posem a la disposició un marc per poder entendre el sorgiment i dinàmics d’organitzacions nemàtiques a escala mesoscòpiques en xarxes d’actina. \nA la part II de la tesi, desenvolupem un model general per gels nemàtics i actius sobre superfícies deformables. Un altre cop, el formalisme no lineal d’Onsager proporciona un mètode simple per desenvolupar transparentment models complexos. El sistema resultant s’ajusta a la dinàmica de la forma de les parelles, la dinàmica nemàtica, la dinàmica de densitat i la hidrodinàmica interfacial. Exercitem aquest model per entendre l’autoorganització de l’anell citocinètic mitjançant una formulació numèrica axisimètrica. Finalment, proveïm un enfocament computacional 3D general i l’apliquem per a una superfície cristal·lina líquida activa inextensible. Examinem la interacció entre els moviments.", "authors": [{"name": "W.

{"title": "A Bayesian Generative Model of Vestibular Afferent Neuron Spiking", "abstract": "Using an information criterion to evaluate models fitted to spike train data from chinchilla semicircular canal afferent neurons, we found that the superficially complex functional organization of the canal nerve branch can be accurately quantified in an elegant mathematical model with only three free parameters. Spontaneous spike trains are samples from stationary renewal processes whose interval distributions are Exwald distributions, convolutions of Inverse Gaussian and Exponential distributions. We show that a neuronal membrane compartment is a natural computer for calculating parameter likelihoods given samples from a point process with such a distribution, which may facilitate fast, accurate, efficient Bayesian neural computation for estimating the kinematic state of the head. The model suggests that Bayesian neural computation is an aspect of a more general principle that has driven the evolution of nervous system design, the energy efficiency of biological information processing. Significance Statement Nervous systems ought to have evolved to be Bayesian, because Bayesian inference allows statistically optimal evidence-based decisions and actions. A variety of circumstantial evidence suggests that animal nervous systems are indeed capable of Bayesian inference, but it is unclear how they could do this. We have identified a simple, accurate generative model of vestibular semicircular canal afferent neuron spike trains. If the brain is a Bayesian observer and a Bayes-optimal decision maker, then the initial stage of processing vestibular information must be to compute the posterior density of head kinematic state given sense data of this form. The model suggests how neurons could do this. Head kinematic state estimation given point-process inertial data is a well-defined dynamical inference problem whose solution formed a foundation for vertebrate brain evolution. The new model provides a foundation for developing realistic, testable spiking neuron models of dynamical state estimation in the vestibulo-cerebellum, and other parts of the Bayesian brain.", "authors": [{"name": "M.

{"title": "Reinforcing feature distributions of hidden units of Boltzmann machine using correlations", "abstract": "This paper introduces and analyses the method of applying Neuroscience methods to Boltzmann Machine, involving a combination of cognitive psychology, information theory, and dynamical systems. We utilized the emergent property of the probability of hidden layers to find the pattern of how units are behaving when stimulated by the visual layer and research into enhancing the predictive encoding capability of the encoding layer. We measure the connections and links between the units of the encoding layer by approximating it with the probability distribution of two units' activation behaviours. For example, the portion of the Auditory cortex responsible for processing auditory information, such as music, differs from the sections responsible for processing visual information, although they can still be linked and active concurrently. Besides, Neurons can modify their connections by learning new information and reinforcing the connections that have been utilized more frequently, and forgetting the connections if the probability distributions of two units diverge much. The Boltzmann machine is the probabilistic inference machine for ground truth using the free energy principle. The latter has stepped further from the concept to interpret cortical responses as a fundamental of intelligent agency. With simple and random interactions of each neuron, this 'intelligent agency' could achieve sophisticated functions in a specific area of a brain. Randomness is also a vital aspect of learning since it may achieve balance and embrace regularities according to Ramsey's Theory.", "authors": [{"name": "Peixu Cai", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "W.

{"title": "Global Energetics of Solar Flares. IX. Refined Magnetic Modeling", "abstract": "A more accurate analytical solution of the vertical-current approximation nonlinear force-free field (VCA3-NLFFF) model is presented that includes, besides the radial (Br) and azimuthal (Bφ) magnetic field components, a poloidal component as well. This new analytical solution is of second-order accuracy in the divergence-freeness condition and of third-order accuracy in the force-freeness condition. We reanalyze the sample of 173 GOES M- and X-class flares observed with the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly and Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). The new code reproduces helically twisted loops with a low winding number below the kink instability consistently, avoiding unstable, highly twisted structures of the Gold–Hoyle flux rope type. The magnetic energies agree within with the Wiegelmann (W-NLFFF) code. The time evolution of the magnetic field reveals multiple, intermittent energy buildup and releases in most flares, contradicting both the Rosner–Vaiana model (with gradual energy storage in the corona) and the principle of timescale separation (τflare ≪ τstorage) postulated in self-organized criticality models. The mean dissipated flare energy is found to amount to 7% ± 3% of the potential energy, or 60% ± 26% of the free energy, a result that can be used for predicting flare magnitudes based on the potential field of active regions.", "authors": [{"name": "M.

{"title": "Internal outset", "abstract": "The present dissertation took the free-energy principle (FEP) as its starting point, from which we tried to draw both philosophical and empirical consequences. \n\nBoth chapter 2 and 3 departed from the idea that conscious perception depends on global amplification of sensory input, and that the basal ganglia (BG) and its irrigation by dopamine play a crucial role in gating information, conscious access, and the selection of a relevant internal model given available sensory data. The BG are thought to play this role due to their modulatory influence on thalamocortical connectivity. Because much of the evidence implicating the BG in these processes in humans is correlational, we explored two ways of manipulating BG activity experimentally.\n\nChapter 4 investigates the philosophical heritage implicitly touched on by the FEP, which provides an alternative philosophical and historical background for present-day research in cognitive neuroscience. Friston’s FEP has been received with great enthusiasm. With good reason: it not only makes the bold claim to a unifying theory of the brain, but it is presented as an a priori principle applicable to living systems in general. In this paper, we set out to show how the breadth of scope of Friston’s framework converges with the dialectics of Georg Hegel. Through an appeal to the work of Catherine Malabou, we aimed to demonstrate how Friston not only reinvigorates Hegelian dialectics from the perspective of neuroscience, but that the implicit alignment with Hegel necessitates a reading of the FEP from the perspective of Hegel’s speculative philosophy. It is this reading that moves beyond the discussion between cognitivism and enactivism surrounding Friston’s framework; beyond the question whether the organism is a secluded entity separated from its surroundings, or whether it is a dynamical system characterized by perpetual openness and mutual exchange. From a Hegelian perspective, it is the tension between both positions itself that is operative at the level of the organism; as a contradiction the organism sustains over the course of its life. Not only does the organism’s secluded existence depend on a perpetual relation with its surroundings, but the condition for there to be such a relation is the existence of a secluded entity. We intended to show how this contradiction – tension internalized – is at the center of Friston’s anticipatory organism; how it is this contradiction that grounds the perpetual process of free energy minimization.\n\nChapter 5 is the report of a study attempting to contrast the FEP’s perspective with that of traditional cognitive neuroscience. While the FEP casts the brain as an organism’s predictive model of how its world works and will continue to work in the future in which action is afforded a central place, research on the brain’s predictive capacities remains beholden to traditional research practices in which participants are passively shown stimuli without their active involvement (as we also did in Chapters 2 and 3). The current study is an investigation into ways in which self-generated predictions may differ from externally induced predictions. Participants completed a volatile spatial attention task under both conditions (externally/cue-induced, internally/action-induced) on different days. We used the Hierarchical Gaussian Filter, an approximate Bayesian inference model, to determine subject-specific parameters of belief-updating and inferred volatility. We found preliminary evidence in support of self-generated predictions incurring a larger reaction time cost when violated compared to predictions induced by sensory cue, which translated to participants’ increased sensitivity to changes in environmental volatility. Our results suggest that internally generated predictions may be afforded more weight, but these results are complicated by session order and duration effects, as well as a lack of statistical power.", "authors": [{"name": "E.

{"title": "Magnetic helicity and the relaxation of fossil fields", "abstract": "In the absence of an active dynamo, purely poloidal magnetic field configurations are unstable to large-scale dynamical perturbations, and decay via reconnection on an Alfvenic time-scale. Nevertheless, a number of classes of dynamo-free stars do exhibit significant, long-lived, surface magnetic fields. Numerical simulations suggest that the large-scale poloidal field in these systems is stabilized by a toroidal component of the field in the stellar interior. Using the principle of conservation of total helicity, we develop a variational principle for computing the structure of the magnetic field inside a conducting sphere surrounded by an insulating vacuum. We show that, for a fixed total helicity, the minimum energy state corresponds to a force-free configuration. We find a simple class of axisymmetric solutions, parametrized by angular and radial quantum numbers. However, these solutions have a discontinuity in the toroidal magnetic field at the stellar surface which will exert a toroidal stress on the surface of the star. We then describe two other classes of solutions, the standard spheromak solutions and ones with fixed surface magnetic fields, the latter being relevant for neutron stars with rigid crusts. We discuss the implications of our results for the structure of neutron star magnetic fields, the decay of fields, and the origin of variability and outbursts in magnetars.", "authors": [{"name": "A.

{"title": "Es el principio de la energía libre una teoría normativa o descriptiva de la cognición", "abstract": "The last two decades have witnessed a resurgence of Bayesian statistics, which was regarded as a marginal discipline during most of the twentieth century. This phenomenon has had a profound effect on neuroscience, not only in terms of the kinds of methods used to analyze experimental data, but also in the way perception and action are conceptualized from a theoretical standpoint. This shift can be summarized in the Bayesian brain hypothesis, which holds that one of the central features of this organ is to mount Bayesian statistical inferences. In this context, the principle of free energy proposed by Karl Friston has emerged as a possible candidate for a unified theory of cognition. The purpose of this article is twofold. The first is to introduce the principle of free energy from a philosophical perspective; the second is to clarify whether this principle should be seen as a normative theory of cognition or if, on the contrary, it can be used to make empirical predictions about the sort computational processes that characterize human cognition. In conclusion, the principle of free energy, as often presented by Friston, is a descriptive theory on the type of computational algorithms the brain uses. Moreover, there is not enough empirical evidence in its favor and, in fact, a large number of findings point in the opposite direction.", "authors": [{"name": "E.

{"title": "Research on Applications of Solar Power in Countryside", "abstract": "Solar energy is a new pollution-free energy of maturetechnology andabundantreserves. This paper firstly introduces the concept and characteristics of the solar power, and then analyzes the necessity and feasibility of its applications in rural areas. Finally, this paper gives three examples of the applications of solar power in the rural areas, which are sewage treatment, heating system and greenhouse cultivation in order to providesome references for the related researchers. Concept and Features of Solar Power Solar energy generally refers to the solar radiation energy, which is a type of natural energy.Since the formation of the earth, the creatures are mainly provided with the sun's heat and light to survive. Humans have learned to sun dried objects to preserve food as salted fish. Solar energy has become an important part of human energy use in the case of fossil fuels, and has been continuously developing. The use of solar energy has two ways of passive use and photoelectric conversion, solar power is an emerging renewable energy. The amount of surface heat energy mainly depends on the size of the solar altitude angle. Therefore, people area available to make use of the solar energy resources more fullyin the high latitude and high altitude areas. There are two main ways for people to use the solar energy.One is the heat storage, heat collection and direct use of heat, such as has been widely used in the solar water heater, solar cookers, air conditioner, passive solar heating room, dryer and heat collector. The other is photoelectric conversion. We convert solar energy into electrical energy and savings, eventually in the form of power supply to meet people's needs. This is currently the main direction of the application of solar energy, such as the solar battery, hydrogen production device and solar bicycles, automobiles and aircraft. Necessity and Feasibility of Applications of Solar Power in Countryside At present, China's rural persons mainly rely on the traditional straw and firewood as the main source of energy.Electricity, gas and other commercial energy is still usedrelatively in a low rate. Specifically speaking, the rural energy consumption can be divided into three categories. First, the energy to cook mainly depends on the straw. The effect of the large use of biogas input is not stable and the maintenance is not convenient for many farmers to bring inconvenience to the family so that it is not widely used. The second type of the energy is electricity. The third is the energy to heat. With the improvement of the living standards of the first farmers, the demand for energy in the rural areas has increased sharply, which has intensified the contradiction between the supply and the supply of rural energy, which makes the rural energy use face a series of problems. China's rural life energy use structure of a single long firewood and straw and other biomass. With the medium and long term urbanization, the acceleration of the process of industrialization, the farmers and urban residents' life style is becoming more and more convergent. Traditional energy cannot meet the 5th International Conference on Environment, Materials, Chemistry and Power Electronics (EMCPE 2016) © 2016. The authors Published by Atlantis Press 26 rural life. Secondly, the rural energy use efficiency is low. Again, the technical services cannot keep up with the construction of rural energy projects. Therefore, it is urgent to develop and utilize new energy resources in rural areas. Solar energy has affordable and reliable characteristics, which can save considerablehome energy costs. A solar water heater can save nearly a thousand Yuan in the process of supplying hot water for consumers. The technology of combine the simple chemical principle with mechanical engineering is more and more mature, which will solve the problem of the influence of the bitter salt water in the northern countryside. Solar power can make good use of the limited resources. Buildings are generally not more than three layers in countryside.The vast majority of rural housing hasan ordinary solar hot installation conditions. It is easy to install and use the solar energy. The opening and utilization of solar energy in China's rural areas have obvious advantages. Concrete Applications of Solar Power in Countryside For a long time, rural domestic sewage treatment did not receive due attention. As the rural population living scattered, most of the sewage without treatment directly flow into the river or into the nearby underground. Some built sewage treatment facilities are underutilized. The solar power can change the current situation. Centralized collection and sewage into the sewage treatment system in the anaerobic pool, part of the sewage in the anaerobic tank complete degradation process and improve the sewage can biochemical, thus speeding up the sewage treatment speed and saving energy consumption. After anaerobic treatment of sewage and oxygen into the pool, the facultative pond there are a lot of denitrifying bacteria, denitrifying bacteria in the facultative pond. A large number of organic compounds will return to the mixture of large amount of nitrate nitrogen and nitrite nitrogen reduced to nitrogen gas, and reduce the concentration of nitrogen in sewage. Then the sewage enters the biological contact oxidation tank, and the organic matters in the sewage can be degraded further. Biological contact oxidation process was designed to be used as an aerobic treatment process. Bio contact oxidation process, also known as submerged biological filter, is the active sludge process and biological filter. Ammonia nitrogen by nitrification of ammonia nitrogen concentration decreased significantly, with the nitrification process, wastewater nitrate nitrogen concentration increased; activated sludge phosphorus accumulating bacteria in aerobic conditions to absorb a large amount of phosphorus, and the transformation is not soluble poly phosphate in the body, finally settling tank discharge of surplus sludge phosphorus removal system. After settling pond treatment, the water was finally entered into the wetland filter for further treatment, and the sludge produced by the sedimentation tank was treated by the method of artificial regular cleaning. Wetland treatment techniques rely on physical, chemical and biological interaction of water purification process, through filtration, adsorption, precipitation, ion exchange, absorption of plant and microbial decomposition to achieve further depth of sewage treatment. When the sewage flows through the wetland bed, a large number of suspended solids and insoluble organic matter was packing and root interception. The dissolved organic matter by biofilm adsorption and microorganism's metabolism degradation, also has a part of organic matter is plant uptake and removal. Ammonia nitrogen wastewater in the wetland in hand by adsorption, filtration, precipitation, plants, and microorganisms as nutrition absorption can be removed. In addition, the artificial wetland has strong sterilization effect on Escherichia coli. After the treatment of rural sewage, the water can reach the level A of the \"discharge standardof urban sewage treatment plant pollutant”, which can be showed in Table 1.", "authors": [{"name": "Mai Huang", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2016, "doi": "10.2991/EMCPE-16.2016.6", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": "47f7b4eac222f51e9489726622cdca87832c2b32", "openalex_id": null, "venue": null, "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "A Thermodynamical Approach for Probability Estimation", "abstract": "The issue of discrete probability estimation for samples of small size is addressed in this study. The maximum likelihood method often suffers over-fitting when insufficient data is available. Although the Bayesian approach can avoid over-fitting by using prior distributions, it still has problems with objective analysis. In response to these drawbacks, a new theoretical framework based on thermodynamics, where energy and temperature are introduced, was developed.

{"title": "Understanding Enzyme Superfamilies", "abstract": "Prior to the discovery in 1990 that mandelate racemase (MR) and muconate-lactonizing enzyme (MLE) are structurally similar enzymes that catalyze different overall reactions (1), structurally related enzymes were assumed to catalyze identical chemical reactions but, perhaps, with distinct substrate specificities. For example, all of the members of the serine protease superfamily were known to catalyze the same chemistry, hydrolyses of peptide bonds, although their peptide substrates varied. As described by Craik and Perona in the previous minireview (2), evolutionary accommodation of these differences in substrate specificity can result in major reorganization of the associated structures. In this minireview, we discuss four recently discovered enzyme superfamilies in which an alternate theme predominates; within each of these superfamilies, the member proteins share a common structural scaffold but catalyze different overall reactions. For each of the superfamilies described, the active sites are contained within a single homologous domain. Although they represent several distinct family folds, the enzyme functions in each superfamily are related to their respective structural scaffolds in the same way; the proteins within each superfamily utilize a common mechanistic strategy for lowering the free energies of the rate-limiting transition states in the reactions they catalyze. The existence of several examples of such superfamilies lends further credence to the principle that the evolution of new catalytic activities involves the incorporation of new catalytic groups within an active site while retaining those groups necessary to catalyze the partial reaction common to all of them (3–5). As a consequence, the range of catalytic functions that can be accommodated by a single structural scaffold is considerably broader than had been previously suspected. Further, the diversity of function that each superfamily represents allows an economy in the number of unique protein folds required to support life and, as a result, undoubtedly has “simplified” the course of metabolic evolution. The Enolase Superfamily: Abstraction of the a-Protons of Carboxylic Acids We recently described the enolase superfamily, the members of which catalyze at least 11 different chemical reactions, including racemization, epimerization, and both syn and anti b-elimination reactions involving water, ammonia, or an intramolecular carboxylate group as leaving group (5). Despite broad differences in substrate structures and the overall reactions they catalyze, all of the reactions of the enolase superfamily are initiated by a common partial reaction, metal-assisted, general base-catalyzed abstraction of the aproton of a carboxylate anion to generate a stabilized enolate anion intermediate (Reaction 1). However, the fate of the intermediate (protonation in the case of racemization and epimerization reactions and vinylogous b-elimination in the others) must be determined by the different functional groups that “surround” the intermediate in the active site. The common partial reaction is thermodynamically difficult: the pKa values of the a-protons in the substrates range from 29 to 32 whereas the pKa values of the conjugate acids of the active site bases accepting the protons are #7. The enzyme-active sites must destabilize the enzyme-substrate complex and/or stabilize the enzyme-intermediate complex so that the free energy of the transition state for a-proton abstraction can be lowered sufficiently to be consistent with the observed kcat values.", "authors": [{"name": "P.

{"title": "The importance of being precise: Commentary on “New Project for a Scientific Psychology: General Scheme” by Mark Solms", "abstract": "It is a great pleasure to comment on Solms’ Rosetta Stone. This commentary focuses on the New Project as a natural science. As such, the New Project has to conform to natural laws. In the physical sciences, there is only one principle we have to worry about, namely, Hamilton’s principle of stationary action. From this principle, one has to elaborate a physics of sentience. I think that Solms meets this challenge, casting Freud’s Project in a light – and language – that physicists and neurobiologists would be comfortable with. This is a remarkable achievement but not entirely unanticipated. I refer here to a line of thinking that inherits from the students of Plato, through Kant and Helmholtz, to modern day treatments of the Bayesian brain (Helmholtz 1878/1971). Given that Freud built upon the foundations laid by Helmholtz, the [re]union of Freudian and Helmholtzian thinking – on offer in the New Project – should be of no surprise. Although the mathematical details may take a few years to tie down with precision (sic) and grace, I think all the heavy lifting has been accomplished with this [re]visionary monograph. This commentary focuses on what the Solms’ [re]vision brings to the table, in terms of the functional architectures that underwrite a physics of sentience. There are some beautifully phrased sentences in it that speak to the fundaments of the free energy principle – and some that take us into new territory. I will frame my critique around these key observations and unpack them from the perspective of active inference.", "authors": [{"name": "Karl J.

{"title": "Impact of massively parallel computation on protein structure determination.", "abstract": "For the past two decades, an important paradigm in protein chemistry has been the assertion that a biologically active protein is at thermodynamic equilibrium and therefore adopts its minimum free energy structure. Although some evidence now suggests that not all proteins conform to this notion, it is true often enough to remain an important guiding principle in structure determination, whether by direct computation or by the computationally assisted approaches of diffraction and resonance. Among the difficulties in predicting structure from sequence are the lack of a useful potential function incorporating the influence of solvent and the inability to sample the phase space efficiently or even to determine whether a free energy minimum is, in fact, the global minimum. These problems are general. Although they are greatly mitigated by experimental information, they become increasingly severe as empirical constraints are reduced. We review the difficulties involved in the general problem of protein structure prediction and discuss the impact of increased computer power in the context of new approaches to solvation and parallel algorithm design. A general focus of our discussion is the need to understand the theoretical basis for effective theories and to accommodate in numerical methods the interplay of different temporal and spatial scales.", "authors": [{"name": "R.

{"title": "Higher oligomeric surfactants – from fundamentals to applications", "abstract": "Surfactants are organic compounds containing in one molecule both lyophobic (hydrophobic) and lyophilic (hydrophilic) parts. Due to such amphiphilic structure surfactants exhibit specific properties in solutions, as well as in solid state. When present at low concentrations in solutions they adsorb at all available interfaces (liquid/gas, liquid /liquid, liquid /solid) and as a consequence dramatically change their free energy. At higher concentrations, above so called critical micellization concentration, when all the interfaces are occupied, surfactants self-assemble in the bulk in various structures: micelles, vesicles and liquid crystals. Surfactants versatile phase behavior and ability to form different structures, with sizes from nano to micro-scale, is a reason why they are widely used in various industrial processes, ranging from classical (paints, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, foods) to modern technologies (synthesis of advanced materials, environmental protection). Moreover, surfactants have important roles in living organisms. Examples are pulmonary surfactants, proteins, biological membranes which can be considered to be self-assembled bilayers of surface active compounds, etc. In constant search for more efficient and environmentally friendly surfactants, both academic and industrial interest has been focused on design and preparation of novel, complex, surfactant structures, with improved properties in comparison with conventional surfactants, i.e. those containing only one hydrophilic and one hydrophobic group. Novel surfactants which have attracted considerable interest in last two decades are oligomeric surfactants. These compounds are made up of two or more amphiphilic moieties covalently linked at the level of the head groups or very close to them by a spacer group. This means that, at least in principle, it is possible to synthetize oligomeric surfactants using two or more molecules of identical or different conventional surfactant and connecting them with a spacer group varying in chemical nature, length, hydrophobicity and rigidity. The number of possible architectures, and thus properties, is vast. In this chapter the influence of the oligomerization degree, length of hydrophobic chains, nature of the spacer and topology of the molecule on the properties of higher oligomeric surfactants in the solution and at the interfaces is discussed. Comparison is made with behavior of corresponding monomeric and dimeric surfactants. Special emphasis is placed on possible applications of higher oligomeric surfactants.", "authors": [{"name": "D.

{"title": "The Clinical, Philosophical, Evolutionary and Mathematical Machinery of Consciousness: An Analytic Dissection of the Field Theories and a Consilience of Ideas", "abstract": "The Cartesian model of mind-body dualism concurs with religious traditions. However, science has supplanted this idea with an energy-matter theory of consciousness, where matter is equivalent to the body and energy replaces the mind or soul. This equivalency is analogous to the concept of the interchange of mass and energy as expressed by Einstein’s famous equation \\begin{document}E=mc^{2}\\end{document}. Immanuel Kant, in his Critique of Pure Reason, provided the intellectual and theoretical framework for a theory of mind or consciousness. Any theory of consciousness must include the fact that a conscious entity, as far as is known, is a wet biological medium (the brain), of stupendously high entropy. This organ or entity generates a field that must account for the \"binding problem\", which we will define. This proposed field, the conscious electro-magnetic information (CEMI) field, also has physical properties, which we will outline. We will also demonstrate the seamless transition of the Kantian philosophy of the a priori conception of space and time, the organs of perception and conception, into the CEMI field of consciousness. We will explore the concept of the CEMI field and its neurophysiological correlates, and in particular, synchronous and coherent gamma oscillations of various neuronal ensembles, as in William J Freeman's experiments in the early 1970s with olfactory perception in rabbits. The expansion of the temporo-parietal-occipital (TPO) cortex in hominid evolution epitomizes metaphorical and abstract thinking. This area of the cortex, with synchronous thalamo-cortical oscillations has the best fit for a minimal neural correlate of consciousness. Our field theory shifts consciousness from an abstract idea to a tangible energy with defined properties and a mathematical framework. Even further, it is not a coincidence that the cerebral cortex is very thin with respect to the diameter of the brain. This is in keeping with its fantastically high entropy, as we see in the event horizon of a black hole and the conformal field theory/anti-de Sitter (CFT/ADS) holographic model of the universe. We adumbrate the uniqueness of consciousness of an advanced biological system such as the human brain and draw insight from Avicenna’s gendanken, floating man thought experiment. The multi-system high volume afferentation of a biological wet system honed after millions of years of evolution, its high entropy, and the CEMI field variation inducing currents in motor output pathways are proposed to spark the seeds of consciousness. We will also review Karl Friston's free energy principle, the concept of belief-update in a Bayesian inference framework, the minimization of the divergence of prior and posterior probability distributions, and the entropy of the brain. We will streamline these highly technical papers, which view consciousness as a minimization principle akin to Hilbert's action in deriving Einstein's field equation or Feynman's sum of histories in quantum mechanics. Consciousness here is interpreted as flow of probability densities on a Riemmanian manifold, where the gradient of ascent on this manifold across contour lines determines the magnitude of perception or the degree of update of the belief-system in a Bayesian inference model. Finally, the science of consciousness has transcended metaphysics and its study is now rooted in the latest advances of neurophysiology, neuro-radiology under the aegis of mathematics.", "authors": [{"name": "H.

{"title": "Approaching the limits: scoring functions for affinity prediction", "abstract": "One of the main tasks of computational methods in ligand design and lead identification is the elucidation and assessment of interaction modes between small-molecule ligands and protein target structures. This generally requires to estimate the relative or absolute affinity of a protein-ligand complex from its three-dimensional coordinates. Although statistical thermodynamics would in principle provide the necessary equations to calculate free energies of binding from molecular properties, these equations are not readily amenable to computation since appropriate ensembles of the solvated systems must be generated and thoroughly sampled, which normally requires prohibitively long computing times. For the purpose of drug design, and virtual screening in particular, simpler and faster methods are needed, which are commonly referred to as scoring functions. \n \nIn general, three major classes of scoring functions can be distinguished: force-field based methods, knowledge-based potentials, and empirical scoring functions. For any of these classes, many different functions have been developed over the past years. Although large-scale and truly unbiased comparative assessments of their performance are relatively rare due to inherent difficulties in setting up appropriate test sets, the strengths and limitations of current scoring functions are fairly evident from the available data. In general, good results can be obtained in the identification or reproduction of experimentally observed binding modes. The ability to distinguish active ligands from decoys appears, at least, to be sufficient to make virtual screening a practically useful endeavour. However, the correlation with the experimental binding free energy and the possibility to quantitate the effects of small structural changes on the ligand affinity are in many cases still disappointing. \n \nBased on the approximations used by current scoring functions, strategies for improvement can be defined. On the other hand, there are some fundamental problems, also with respect to the underlying experimental data, which suggest that the best functions presently available may already be close to the limit of what can be achieved with empirical approaches.", "authors": [{"name": "C.

{"title": "Toward Integral Field Tomography of Living Systems", "abstract": "Modern medical diagnostics relies on modality-specific approximations—CT for density, MRI for proton environments, ultrasound for mechanical impedance, and PET for metabolic proxies—each observing a projection of the organism rather than the organism itself. Disease, however, is not merely a structural anomaly but a loss of system stability, often established long before macroscopic changes become detectable. This article introduces the concept of Integral Field Tomography (IFT), a novel framework for reconstructing the internal physiological state of a living organism by solving the inverse problem of its externally measurable physical fields. Living systems are conceptualized as unified, multi-field entities: electrodynamic, magnetodynamic, mechanical continua, metabolic dissipative structures, and information-processing systems far from equilibrium. These processes continuously generate electrical, magnetic, mechanical, and photonic fields that propagate beyond tissue boundaries, serving as fundamental expressions of physiological state. IFT proposes to capture these fields simultaneously using ultra-sensitive detectors—including optically pumped magnetometers, laser vibrometers, and quantum-limited photonic sensors—and to reconstruct the organism's internal state through multi-scale, multi-physics inverse modeling. Artificial intelligence plays an intrinsic role in learning personalized priors, enforcing physical constraints, integrating heterogeneous data, and maintaining a living digital twin of the organism. The framework aligns naturally with active inference, reconceptualizing diagnosis as the estimation of how well the organism minimizes its own variational free energy. This shift from episodic structural imaging to continuous state inference enables detection before structural damage, monitoring of aging as loss of system coherence, evaluation of interventions at the level of state recovery, and the establishment of individualized baselines instead of population norms. Fundamental physical limits—quantum noise, thermal fluctuations, and information-theoretic constraints—lie far above current clinical thresholds, confirming that the primary obstacles are conceptual and computational, not physical. Integral Field Tomography represents not merely a new device but a new epistemology of medicine, transforming diagnostics from looking at bodies to reading living systems as coherent, measurable, dynamic wholes.", "authors": [{"name": "Jaba Tkemaladze", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2026, "doi": "10.65649/j2mx4727", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": "a0927a0ab186617eb9b5373c0b2976ec27e00308", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "Longevity Horizon", "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "Meta-level Experience Sharing for Autonomous Systems by Fusing Generative Hierarchical Dynamic Bayesian Networks", "abstract": "Experience sharing is a fundamental learning capability of human nature. Imagine that you need to pass through a congested road in the shortest time possible. You would try to remember how you previously handle such situations and optimize the route by fusing this knowledge with previous similar experiences. In addition, one can integrate these experiences with other information sources that suggest solutions. Transferring this type of intelligence to autonomous navigation systems implies the ability to first represent experiences through discriminative and generative models, and then create new optimal models, by fusing new and existing scenarios that the agent encounters. We propose a meta-level experience-sharing and learning method for a Bayesian autonomous agent. We introduce a joint state estimation method for discrete and continuous random variables, using Hierarchical Dynamic Bayesian Networks. In the proposed system, meta-level knowledge is learned and represented from lower dimensional odometry data, by observing behaviors from a third-person viewpoint. The learned knowledge is then transformed into a first-person agent viewpoint to perform such tasks online. Multiple learned predictive models and new experiences are fused into a single and more robust model during the online stage. Through the principle of free energy minimization, the learned Hierarchical Dynamic Bayesian Networks are used to coherently estimate discrete and continuous state variables for hierarchical-level anomaly detection and inference problems. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method optimizes the number of models by fusing similar experiences managed by the agent, while making anomaly detection and incremental learning steps more robust.", "authors": [{"name": "Carlo S.

{"title": "World models and predictive coding for cognitive and developmental robotics: frontiers and challenges", "abstract": "ABSTRACT Creating autonomous robots that can actively explore the environment, acquire knowledge and learn skills continuously is the ultimate achievement envisioned in cognitive and developmental robotics. Importantly, if the aim is to create robots that can continuously develop through interactions with their environment, their learning processes should be based on interactions with their physical and social world in the manner of human learning and cognitive development. Based on this context, in this paper, we focus on the two concepts of world models and predictive coding. Recently, world models have attracted renewed attention as a topic of considerable interest in artificial intelligence. Cognitive systems learn world models to better predict future sensory observations and optimize their policies, i.e. controllers. Alternatively, in neuroscience, predictive coding proposes that the brain continuously predicts its inputs and adapts to model its own dynamics and control behavior in its environment. Both ideas may be considered as underpinning the cognitive development of robots and humans capable of continual or lifelong learning. Although many studies have been conducted on predictive coding in cognitive robotics and neurorobotics, the relationship between world model-based approaches in AI and predictive coding in robotics has rarely been discussed. Therefore, in this paper, we clarify the definitions, relationships, and status of current research on these topics, as well as missing pieces of world models and predictive coding in conjunction with crucially related concepts such as the free-energy principle and active inference in the context of cognitive and developmental robotics. Furthermore, we outline the frontiers and challenges involved in world models and predictive coding toward the further integration of AI and robotics, as well as the creation of robots with real cognitive and developmental capabilities in the future.

{"title": "Exploring Cognition through Morphological Info-Computational Framework", "abstract": "Traditionally, cognition has been considered a uniquely human capability involving perception, memory, learning, reasoning, and problem-solving. However, recent research shows that cognition is a fundamental ability shared by all living beings, from single cells to complex organisms. This chapter takes an info-computational approach (ICON), viewing natural structures as information and the processes of change in these structures as computations. It is a relational framework dependent on the perspective of a cognizing observer/cognizer. Informational structures are properties of the material substrate, and when focusing on the behavior of the substrate, we discuss morphological computing (MC). ICON and MC are complementary perspectives for a cognizer. Information and computation are inseparably connected with cognition. This chapter explores research connecting nature as a computational structure for a cognizer, with morphological computation, morphogenesis, agency, extended cognition, and extended evolutionary synthesis, using examples of the free energy principle and active inference. It introduces theoretical and practical approaches challenging traditional computational models of cognition limited to abstract symbol processing, highlighting the computational capacities inherent in the material substrate (embodiment). Understanding the embodiment of cognition through its morphological computational basis is crucial for biology, evolution, intelligence theory, AI, robotics, and other fields.", "authors": [{"name": "G.

{"title": "Embodied Object Representation Learning and Recognition", "abstract": "Scene understanding and decomposition is a crucial challenge for intelligent systems, whether it is for object manipulation, navigation, or any other task. Although current machine and deep learning approaches for object detection and classification obtain high accuracy, they typically do not leverage interaction with the world and are limited to a set of objects seen during training. Humans on the other hand learn to recognize and classify different objects by actively engaging with them on first encounter. Moreover, recent theories in neuroscience suggest that cortical columns in the neocortex play an important role in this process, by building predictive models about objects in their reference frame. In this article, we present an enactive embodied agent that implements such a generative model for object interaction. For each object category, our system instantiates a deep neural network, called Cortical Column Network (CCN), that represents the object in its own reference frame by learning a generative model that predicts the expected transform in pixel space, given an action. The model parameters are optimized through the active inference paradigm, i.e., the minimization of variational free energy. When provided with a visual observation, an ensemble of CCNs each vote on their belief of observing that specific object category, yielding a potential object classification. In case the likelihood on the selected category is too low, the object is detected as an unknown category, and the agent has the ability to instantiate a novel CCN for this category. We validate our system in an simulated environment, where it needs to learn to discern multiple objects from the YCB dataset. We show that classification accuracy improves as an embodied agent can gather more evidence, and that it is able to learn about novel, previously unseen objects. Finally, we show that an agent driven through active inference can choose their actions to reach a preferred observation.", "authors": [{"name": "Toon Van de Maele", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Tim Verbelen", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Ozan Çatal", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "B.

Here, we report the combination of theoretical and experimental approaches, as well as statistical analysis, to investigate the effect of the monoterpenic group and its stereochemistry in the biological activity of benzaldehyde thiosemicarbazone derivatives, for the identification of their structure-activity relationship. The terpenic thiosemicarbazones displayed the highest activities, confirming that the monoterpenic moiety is essential for activity. Notably, among the compounds tested, the S-(−)-enantiomer of the 4-nitro-derivative (8d) presented considerably lower cytotoxicity than its R-(+)-analogue, emphasizing the importance of the stereochemistry. The most active derivative (8d) exhibited a potent antiprotozoal activity (IC50 2.4 μM) and high selectivity (SI > 1147). Also, theoretical calculations were carried out at the density functional theory (DFT) level to show that the Gibbs free energy and LUMO orbitals present an excellent correlation with the experimental IC50 values. Finally, the combination of all these results may in principle be extremely advantageous to a deeper chemical understanding, as well as, allows a rational alternative for the future development of new drugs that act against leishmaniasis.", "authors": [{"name": "Sabrina A.

{"title": "Why Do Individuals Seek Information? A Selectionist Perspective", "abstract": "Several authors have proposed that mechanisms of adaptive behavior, and reinforcement learning in particular, can be explained by an innate tendency of individuals to seek information about the local environment. In this article, I argue that these approaches adhere to an essentialist view of learning that avoids the question why information seeking should be favorable in the first place. I propose a selectionist account of adaptive behavior that explains why individuals behave as if they had a tendency to seek information without resorting to essentialist explanations. I develop my argument using a formal selectionist framework for adaptive behavior, the multilevel model of behavioral selection (MLBS). The MLBS has been introduced recently as a formal theory of behavioral selection that links reinforcement learning to natural selection within a single unified model. I show that the MLBS implies an average gain in information about the availability of reinforcement. Formally, this means that behavior reaches an equilibrium state, if and only if the Fisher information of the conditional probability of reinforcement is maximized. This coincides with a reduction in the randomness of the expected environmental feedback as captured by the information theoretic concept of expected surprise (i.e., entropy). The main result is that behavioral selection maximizes the information about the expected fitness consequences of behavior, which, in turn, minimizes average surprise. In contrast to existing attempts to link adaptive behavior to information theoretic concepts (e.g., the free energy principle), neither information gain nor surprise minimization is treated as a first principle. Instead, the result is formally deduced from the MLBS and therefore constitutes a mathematical property of the more general principle of behavioral selection. Thus, if reinforcement learning is understood as a selection process, there is no need to assume an active agent with an innate tendency to seek information or minimize surprise. Instead, information gain and surprise minimization emerge naturally because it lies in the very nature of selection to produce order from randomness.", "authors": [{"name": "M.

{"title": "Intrinsic OXPHOS limitations underlie cellular bioenergetics in leukemia.", "abstract": "\n Typified by oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), mitochondria catalyze a wide variety of cellular processes seemingly critical for malignant growth. As such, there is considerable interest in targeting mitochondrial metabolism in cancer. However, notwithstanding the few drugs targeting mutant dehydrogenase activity, nearly all hopeful ‘mito-therapeutics’ cannot discriminate cancerous from non-cancerous OXPHOS and thus suffer from a limited therapeutic index. The present project was based on the premise that the development of efficacious mitochondrial-targeted anti-cancer compounds requires answering two fundamental questions: 1) is mitochondrial bioenergetics in fact different between cancer and non-cancer cells? and 2) If so, what are the underlying mechanisms? Such information is particularly critical for the subset of human cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), in which alterations in mitochondrial metabolism are implicated in various aspects of cancer biology (e.g., clonal expansion and chemoresistance). Herein, we leveraged an in-house diagnostic biochemical workflow to comprehensively evaluate mitochondrial bioenergetic efficiency and capacity in various hematological cell types, with a specific focus on OXPHOS dynamics in AML. Consistent with prior reports, clonal cell expansion, characteristic of leukemia, was universally associated with a hyper-metabolic phenotype which included increases in basal and maximal glycolytic and respiratory flux. However, despite having nearly 2-fold more mitochondria per cell, clonally expanding hematopoietic stem cells, leukemic blasts, as well as chemoresistant AML were all consistently hallmarked by intrinsic limitations in oxidative ATP synthesis (i.e., OXPHOS). Remarkably, by performing experiments across a physiological span of ATP free energy (i.e, ΔGATP), we provide direct evidence that, rather than contributing to cellular ΔGATP, leukemic mitochondria are particularly poised to consume ATP. Relevant to AML biology, acute restoration of OXPHOS kinetics proved highly cytotoxic to leukemic blasts, suggesting that active OXPHOS repression supports aggressive disease dissemination in AML. Taken together, these findings argue against ATP being the primary output of mitochondria in leukemia and provide proof-of-principle that restoring, rather than disrupting, OXPHOS and/or cellular ΔGATP in cancer may represent an untapped therapeutic avenue for combatting hematological malignancy and chemoresistance.", "authors": [{"name": "Margaret A.

{"title": "Broadband phonon to magnon conversion in yttrium iron garnet", "abstract": "We propose and experimentally demonstrate a means of broadband phonon-magnon interconversion that relies on combining magnetoelastic coupling with translational symmetry breaking in the important experimental material yttrium iron garnet (YIG). As well as being of interest for its basic physics, this quasiparticle coupling mechanism adds to the range of effects that potentially find useful application in hybrid solid-state quantum computing devices as well as low-power wave-based classical computing architectures. The magnon is a relative newcomer to the catwalk of hybrid solid-state quantum science but it has already begun to turn heads. The rich physics and ready tunability of microwave magnonic systems combined with their demonstrable compatibility with the existing tools of experimental solid-state quantum engineering suggest significant and wide-reaching opportunities, not only in device design, but also in fundamental research [1–14]. Moreover, in the context of classical computing, there has been steadily growing interest in the use of magnonic systems as a platform for wave-based information technologies that overcome the ever more pressing ‘heat death’ issues associated with conventional computing hardware [15–28]. Indeed, phase-modulated spin-waves have significant appeal as data carriers in both classical and quantum computing devices: they offer Joule-heat-free spin information transfer and their short wavelengths relative to electromagnetic waves of the same frequency (microwave-frequency spin waves have wavelengths in the millimetre to nanometre range) are highly conducive to progressive device miniaturization [24–28]. Moreover, the ability to interconvert between spin-wave or magnon signals and those in other physical domains—notably microwave photonics, spin currents, heat currents, and optics—is widely recognised as a further important dividend [27–30]. However, until now, a notable gap has existed in the catalogue of magnonic conversion effects. Though the coupling between the magnon and phonon systems of magnetic materials was, in fact, the inspiration for the original theoretical framework upon which all of spin-wave and magnon physics came to be based [31], the interconversion between magnon and phonon signals—as opposed to incoherent excitations—had yet to be practically demonstrated [32, 33]. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate the first experimental proof of principle of a novel phonon-based approach to magnon signal generation. The effect is predicated on a new quasiparticle coupling mechanism with two essential ingredients: magnetoelastic coupling of sufficient strength and appropriate symmetry in the magnonic host material; and energy-momentum matching between the phonons and the magnons. The latter is generally difficult to realise since the phonon and magnon dispersion relations overlap and hybridise only over a very narrow range of wavenumbers that would be impractical for broadband signal transfer. As explained below, we circumvent this by borrowing the artifice of translational symmetry breaking that is used to solve similar issues in other areas of wave physics. The key requirement of magnetoelastic coupling is present to exactly the right degree in the magnetic material we choose for our experiments, the popular electrically insulating ferrimagnet yttrium iron garnet or YIG (Y3Fe5O12). The magnetoelastic coupling in YIG is of sufficient magnitude to provide adequate phonon–magnon mode coupling, yet insufficiently strong to compromise the spin-wave decay length. These favourable properties arise on account of the fact that YIG’s magnetic moment comes from S-state Fe3+ ions [34] and that, as is typical of magnetic garnets, the chemical and magnetic unit cells are inequivalent [35]. © 2021 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd Mater. Quantum Technol. 1 (2021) 011003 To address the energy/wavenumber (k) matching issue we take our cue from the operating principle of a Yagi television aerial which phase-matches guided and free-space electromagnetic waves with very different dispersions. The Yagi does this through the expedient of breaking translational symmetry by establishing standing-wave patterns with a geometry calculated to generate spatial frequencies in the local electromagnetic disturbance that match the wavenumbers of the quasiparticles that it is required to produce. We mimic this approach by using a piezoelectric transducer to send a narrow pulsed microwave acoustic beam which impinges locally on a magnonic waveguide fashioned from a YIG film that is subject to an externally applied magnetic field. This process generates a small magnetoelastically active volume defined by the beam profile and the waveguide thickness. The local symmetry break due to the presence of the waveguide interfaces and the resultant acoustic standing wave structure allows the low k magnons to couple effectively to phonons of much higher k values, i.e. well removed from the usual hybridisation regime. Since our aim is a very broadband phonon–magnon conversion process, we generate a spatial frequency spectrum that is as white as possible by engineering the waveguide and the beam to confine the region of magnetoelastic interaction as tightly as possible in all three dimensions. Due to the magnetoelastic coupling, the acoustic displacement of the YIG film locally generates a small signal oscillating internal magnetic field contribution hme, some of whose spatial frequency components are capable of coupling to and exciting MSW modes. In principle, hme couples to an infinite family of propagating modes; however, excitation of the higher order modes is inefficient owing to their low propagation speeds, and hence only the lowest order mode is excited. For a given magnetoelastic free energy density Fme, the oscillating magnetic field is hme = − 1 Ms ∂Fme", "authors": [{"name": "Tsz Chai Fung", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "A.

{"title": "A dual-model approach to blind quality assessment of noisy images", "abstract": "Physiological and psychological evidences exist that the human visual system (HVS) has different behavioral patterns under low and high noise/artifact levels. We propose in this paper a dual-model approach to blind or no-reference (NR) image quality assessment (IQA) of noisy images through differentiating near-threshold and suprathreshold noise conditions. The underlying assumption for the proposed dual-model method is that for images with low level near-threshold noise, HVS tries to gauge the strength of the noise, so the image quality can be well approximated via measuring strength of the noise. And for images with their contents overwhelmed by high level suprathreshold noise, the HVS tries to recover meaningful structure from the noisy pixels using past experiences and prior knowledge encoded into an internal generative model of the brain. So image quality is closely related to the agreement between the noisy observation and the internal generative model explainable part of the image. More specifically, under the near-threshold noise condition, a noise level estimation algorithm based on natural image statistics is used, while under suprathreshold condition, an active inference model based on the free energy principle is adopted.

{"title": "A Partially Observable Deep Multi-Agent Active Inference Framework for Resource Allocation in 6G and Beyond Wireless Communications Networks", "abstract": "Resource allocation is of crucial importance in wireless communications. However, it is extremely challenging to design efficient resource allocation schemes for future wireless communication networks since the formulated resource allocation problems are generally non-convex and consist of various coupled variables. Moreover, the dynamic changes of practical wireless communication environment and user service requirements thirst for efficient real-time resource allocation. To tackle these issues, a novel partially observable deep multi-agent active inference (PODMAI) framework is proposed for realizing intelligent resource allocation. A belief based learning method is exploited for updating the policy by minimizing the variational free energy. A decentralized training with a decentralized execution multi-agent strategy is designed to overcome the limitations of the partially observable state information. Exploited the proposed framework, an intelligent spectrum allocation and trajectory optimization scheme is developed for a spectrum sharing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) network with dynamic transmission rate requirements as an example. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed framework can significantly improve the sum transmission rate of the secondary network compared to various benchmark schemes. Moreover, the convergence speed of the proposed PODMAI is significantly improved compared with the conventional reinforcement learning framework. Overall, our proposed framework can enrich the intelligent resource allocation frameworks and pave the way for realizing real-time resource allocation.", "authors": [{"name": "Fuhui Zhou", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Rui Ding", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Qihui Wu", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Derrick Wing Kwan Ng", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Kai‐Kit Wong", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "N.

{"title": "Delay Feedback Active Inference based on Predicted States for Uncertain Systems with Input Delay", "abstract": "Active inference (AIF) as a comprehensive theory has been proven to be promising in state estimation and adaptive control of uncertain systems. However, the input delay in the controller was ignored in the normal framework. When taking input delay into consideration in the uncertain system, the optimal estimation state in the normal AIF differs greatly from the real state of the system due to the accumulation of the delay effect. Therefore, delay feedback active inference (DAIF) is proposed in this paper. Different from normal AIF, the predictive state based on the delay state becomes the expectation of the state in the generative model. Meanwhile, an epitaxial delayed feedback Proportional-Integral (PI) control is introduced to be the expectation of the preference controller. The variational free energy (VFE) is extended by adding a quadratic of control consumption. The model uncertainty and measurement uncertainty are approximated by the Gaussian distributions. It can be proven that the state estimation does not depend on the given target state in D-AIF. In the simulation experiment of the trajectory tracking of an unmanned aerial vehicle with input delay, the results show that delay feedback active inference control (D-AIFC) has smaller tracking error and perceptual accuracy and shows stronger robustness when dealing with sudden disturbance than active inference control (AIFC).", "authors": [{"name": "Mingyue Ji", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Yang Lyu", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Kunpeng Pan", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Xiaoxuan Zhang", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Quan Pan", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Yang Li", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Chunhui Zhao", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Jin-wen Hu", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}], "year": 2023, "doi": "10.1109/CDC49753.2023.10383848", "arxiv_id": null, "s2_id": "fa24b626f476b09e2d7ae8ea7b5294f03f0b8bde", "openalex_id": null, "venue": "IEEE Conference on Decision and Control", "citation_count": 0, "references": [], "publication_date": null}
{"title": "QoE-Guaranteed Optimization in MEC-Enabled Metaverse: An Active Inference Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach", "abstract": "In this paper, we consider a MEC-enabled metaverse scenario which consists of a remote metaverse server and an edge server that cooperates to provide services to mobile users. The edge server is deployed at the base station (BS), serves a dual role: augmenting computational capabilities for user equipment (UE) and pre-caching a portion of the metaverse service contents before each time slot. Moreover, the foreground information and the requested contents generated by the UEs can also be cached to the BS. We formulate a problem to maximize the cache hit number by jointly optimizing contents pre-caching and resource allocation at the BS while considering UEs preference and reducing the UEs total energy consumption, essential for the efficient delivery of services in dynamic MEC environments. To solve this problem, we reformulate it as a partially observable markov decision process and propose an active inference enabled deep reinforcement learning algorithm, which combines active inference with deep reinforcement learning to select the optimal strategy by minimizing the expected free energy. Simulations show that the proposed algorithm can effectively improve the total quality of experience and the cache hit number of UEs, while minimizing the UEs total energy consumption compared with other baseline algorithms.", "authors": [{"name": "Jianbo Du", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Jie Gong", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Xiaoli Chu", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Zehui Xiong", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Xianfu Chen", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "Mianxiong Dong", "affiliation": null, "orcid": null}, {"name": "F.
