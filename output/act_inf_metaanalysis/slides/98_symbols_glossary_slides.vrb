\textbf{Active Inference} & A framework in which agents minimize
expected free energy to select actions, unifying perception, learning,
and decision-making under the Free Energy Principle. \\
\textbf{Assertion} & A directed, confidence-scored claim linking a paper
to a hypothesis (supports, contradicts, or neutral). The basic unit of
evidence in the knowledge graph. \\
\textbf{Canonical ID} & The unique identifier assigned to each paper
during deduplication, following the priority scheme: DOI \textgreater{}
arXiv ID \textgreater{} Semantic Scholar ID \textgreater{} OpenAlex ID
\textgreater{} title hash. \\
\textbf{Expected Free Energy} & A quantity combining epistemic value
(information gain) and pragmatic value (goal achievement) that active
inference agents minimize over policies. \\
\textbf{Free Energy Principle} & The principle that self-organizing
systems minimize variational free energy, an upper bound on surprise, to
maintain their structural integrity. \\
\textbf{Generative Model} & A probabilistic model specifying the joint
distribution over hidden states and observations, encoding an agent's
beliefs about how observations are generated. \\
\textbf{Knowledge Graph} & A directed graph encoding papers, assertions,
hypotheses, and their relationships, serialized in an RDF-compatible
format. \\
\textbf{Markov Blanket} & A statistical boundary separating internal
states from external states, defined as the set of nodes that renders a
system conditionally independent of its environment. \\
\textbf{Nanopublication} & A minimal, self-contained unit of publishable
knowledge consisting of an assertion, provenance metadata, and
publication context. \\
\textbf{Precision} & The inverse variance of a probability distribution;
in active inference, precision weighting determines the influence of
prediction errors at different levels of a hierarchy. \\
\textbf{Variational Free Energy} & An upper bound on surprise (negative
log-evidence) that can be decomposed into complexity (KL divergence from
prior) and accuracy (expected log-likelihood). \\
\textbf{Louvain Algorithm} & A greedy modularity-maximization algorithm
for community detection in networks. Applied to the citation graph to
identify clusters of densely interconnected papers. \\
\textbf{PageRank} & A centrality metric originally designed for web page
ranking. In citation networks, PageRank identifies highly influential
papers that serve as hubs connecting otherwise disconnected
subgraphs. \\
\textbf{Ward Linkage} & A hierarchical clustering method that minimizes
the total within-cluster variance at each merge step. Used to compute
dendrograms of domain centroids from mean TF-IDF vectors. \\
\textbf{Checkpoint} & A JSON Lines snapshot of LLM extraction progress,
recording which papers have been processed and the resulting assertions,
enabling incremental resume after interruption. \\
\textbf{Incremental Resume} & The pipeline's ability to continue from
where a previous run stopped, loading existing corpus/assertions and
processing only new papers, controlled by \texttt{-\/-clear-corpus} and
\texttt{-\/-clear-assertions} CLI flags. \\
\textbf{LLM Config} & A configuration object specifying the Ollama model
name, API URL, temperature, maximum retries, and retry delay for
LLM-based assertion extraction. \\
\textbf{Domain Timeline} & Per-domain yearly publication counts showing
temporal evolution of research activity across the eight tracked
categories (A1--A2, B, C1--C5). \\
\textbf{Progressive Parsing} & The pipeline's multi-stage JSON recovery
strategy for handling malformed LLM output: direct parse → strip code
fences → extract first JSON array → individual element recovery. \\
\textbf{Wong Palette} & The colorblind-safe 8-color palette from Wong
(2011), used as the standard visualization palette throughout all
pipeline-generated figures. \\
