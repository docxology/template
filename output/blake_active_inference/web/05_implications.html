<h1 id="implications">Implications: The Wider Fields</h1>
<p><em>The doors open onto wider fields.</em></p>
<h2 id="philosophy-of-mind">Philosophy of Mind</h2>
<h3 id="the-romantic-computational-mind">The Romantic Computational
Mind</h3>
<p>The foregoing synthesis raises fundamental questions for philosophy
of mind, cognitive science, and how we understand the relationship
between artistic and scientific knowledge. If Blake’s phenomenological
observations and Friston’s mathematical framework describe the same
cognitive architecture, then the Romantic tradition is not
anti-cognitive but proto-computational—articulating in the language of
vision what neuroscience would later formalize.</p>
<p>Blake’s “As a man is, so he sees” is not merely prescient metaphor;
it is a precise statement of the Active Inference thesis that perception
is model-dependent inference. The convergence suggests that
phenomenological observation and formal modeling approach the same
cognitive reality from different directions, each illuminating what the
other cannot express. Against McGinn’s “mysterianism”—the claim that
consciousness constitutes an irresolvable problem for human cognition
<span class="citation"
data-cites="mcginn2004consciousness">[@mcginn2004consciousness]</span>—the
Blake–Active Inference synthesis suggests a third way: neither reductive
explanation nor mysterian agnosticism, but phenomenological-formal
complementarity, where visionary description and mathematical formalism
illuminate different facets of the same cognitive architecture.</p>
<h3 id="consciousness-as-hierarchical-depth">Consciousness as
Hierarchical Depth</h3>
<p>Blake’s fourfold hierarchy (Figure <span
class="math inline">\(\ref{fig:fourfold}\)</span>) implies degrees of
awareness. Single vision is diminished consciousness. Fourfold vision is
full integration.</p>
<p>If cleansed perception = optimized free energy minimization (Equation
<span class="math inline">\(\ref{eq:cleansing}\)</span>), then
consciousness correlates with well-calibrated generative models. The
dimness of Newton’s sleep is computational: poor precision weighting
(Equation <span class="math inline">\(\ref{eq:prior_dominance}\)</span>)
produces impoverished inference, collapsing the prediction error signal
(Equation <span
class="math inline">\(\ref{eq:prediction_error}\)</span>). Conversely,
expanded consciousness corresponds to deeper hierarchical models that
compress more temporal structure (Equation <span
class="math inline">\(\ref{eq:temporal_hierarchy}\)</span>) and richer
spatial detail (Equation <span
class="math inline">\(\ref{eq:model_complexity}\)</span>) into unified
awareness.</p>
<h2 id="cognitive-science">Cognitive Science</h2>
<h3 id="predictions">Predictions</h3>
<p>Three empirical implications follow from the Blake–Active Inference
correspondence:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Expert perception</strong> — If fourfold vision reflects
hierarchical depth, then artists and naturalists should exhibit richer
hierarchical representations than novices. Studies of perceptual
expertise in visual art <span class="citation"
data-cites="chamberlain2013perceptual">[@chamberlain2013perceptual]</span>
already document enhanced configural processing in trained observers,
consistent with deeper generative models.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Precision modulation</strong> — Contemplative practices
that adjust precision weighting should alter perceptual content in
predictable ways. Meditation traditions emphasizing open monitoring
(reduced prior precision) versus focused attention (increased sensory
precision) provide natural experimental conditions for testing Blake’s
claim that perception varies with the “Organs of Perception.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Psychedelic states</strong> — Substances that alter
precision constraints should produce Blake-like perception of infinite
detail. The ALBUS framework <span class="citation"
data-cites="safron2025albus">[@safron2025albus]</span>, extending the
earlier REBUS model <span class="citation"
data-cites="carthartharris2019rebus">[@carthartharris2019rebus]</span>,
formalizes this prediction: psychedelics can both relax and strengthen
beliefs, reshaping the balance between prior expectations and sensory
evidence—precisely the “cleansing” Blake described.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="neural-correlates">Neural Correlates</h3>
<p>The contrast between “guinea sun” and “Heavenly Host” implies
differentiated processing. Neuroimaging could investigate whether
aesthetic transport exhibits relaxed prior precision and enhanced
sensory processing.</p>
<h2 id="creativity">Creativity</h2>
<h3 id="the-artist-as-model-builder">The Artist as Model-Builder</h3>
<p>If imagination = generative model, then creativity = model
construction.</p>
<p>Blake’s illuminated books—integrating poetry, image, and
print—instantiate this claim. Each work offers a generative model to the
viewer, restructuring their perception.</p>
<h3 id="aesthetic-free-energy">Aesthetic Free Energy</h3>
<p>Great art offers models that resolve more free energy (Equation <span
class="math inline">\(\ref{eq:free_energy}\)</span>) than ordinary
perception—making more sense of more experience.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“To the eyes of the man of imagination, nature is imagination
itself.”</em></p>
<p>— Blake <span class="citation"
data-cites="blake1810judgment">[@blake1810judgment]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The developed perceiver experiences nature as already structured. The
generative model meets itself in the world.</p>
<h2 id="transpersonal-experience">Transpersonal Experience</h2>
<h3 id="mystical-perception">Mystical Perception</h3>
<p>Blake’s visions—“the Innumerable company of the Heavenly Host”—admit
computational interpretation: extreme precision relaxation allowing
radical belief update.</p>
<p>Mysticism on this account is not separate reality but <em>profound
model revision</em>. The doors swing so wide that habitual priors
dissolve.</p>
<h3 id="jerusalem">Building Jerusalem</h3>
<p>Blake’s vision of Jerusalem as collective awakening maps directly
onto the multi-agent framework: Jerusalem = shared generative model
(Equation <span class="math inline">\(\ref{eq:multi_agent}\)</span>) =
collective prior enabling coordinated perception. The Mental Fight—the
tireless labor of model-building—operates at civilizational scale,
reshaping shared priors through education, art, contemplative practice,
and cultural production.</p>
<h2 id="counter-arguments">Counter-Arguments</h2>
<p>Four objections deserve explicit engagement:</p>
<p><strong>The Overfitting Objection.</strong> Any sufficiently general
mathematical framework can be mapped onto any sufficiently general
philosophy; the Blake–Active Inference correspondence may reflect the
breadth of both systems rather than genuine structural alignment. We
concede that generality increases the risk of spurious correspondence.
However, the specificity of our mappings—not merely “Blake values
perception” but “Blake’s fourfold hierarchy structurally mirrors the
factorization of hierarchical generative models”—resists this charge.
The correspondences are not one-to-one between vague themes but between
precise structural features: boundary topology, precision dynamics,
temporal depth, multi-agent factorization.</p>
<p><strong>The Anachronism Objection.</strong> Blake intended no Active
Inference meanings; reading them into his work is historical projection.
This objection applies to all retrospective intellectual history. We do
not claim that Blake <em>intended</em> to describe Markov blankets. We
claim that the phenomenological structures he observed and articulated
in his prophetic poetry exhibit formal properties that Active Inference
independently identifies. Convergent description does not require shared
intention—Darwin and Wallace converged on natural selection without
coordination.</p>
<p><strong>The Formalization Objection.</strong> Poetry resists
equations; translating Blake’s visionary language into mathematical
notation inevitably loses what makes it meaningful. We agree that the
translation is lossy. The formal apparatus captures structural
relations—topology, dynamics, factorization—but not the affective,
aesthetic, and spiritual dimensions of Blake’s work. The equations are
not replacements for the poetry but supplements: making explicit what
the poetry implies about the architecture of perception. The two
languages illuminate different aspects of the same cognitive
reality.</p>
<p><strong>The Selectivity Objection.</strong> The paper cherry-picks
favorable passages while ignoring Blake’s many statements that resist
computational interpretation—his antinomianism, his mythological
personifications, his explicit hostility to “Newton’s Particles of
light.” We acknowledge selection. Our eight themes represent the
strongest structural correspondences, not the totality of Blake’s
thought. Blake’s anti-Newtonian polemic, far from undermining our
thesis, <em>supports</em> it: his critique targets precisely the “single
vision” (shallow, prior-locked inference) that Active Inference
identifies as pathological. The correspondence holds not despite Blake’s
hostility to mechanism but <em>because</em> of it.</p>
<p><strong>The Presentism Objection.</strong> The most subtle risk is
that we are committing “presentism”—reading modern scientific concepts
back into a historical figure whose intellectual context was radically
different. Blake’s sources were Swedenborg, Boehme, and the Book of
Ezekiel, not Helmholtz or Bayes. We take this objection seriously. Our
claim is not causal (that Blake influenced neuroscience) but
<em>structural</em> (that his phenomenological observations and the
formal framework converge on the same cognitive architecture). The
defense against presentism is specificity: vague analogies between
“Romanticism” and “creativity” would indeed be presentist, but precise
mappings between Blake’s fourfold hierarchy and the factorization of
hierarchical generative models resist this charge precisely because they
are falsifiable. If the structural correspondences broke down under
scrutiny—if Blake’s categories did not map onto computationally distinct
operations—the project would fail. That they hold is evidence of
convergent insight, not anachronistic projection.</p>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p><strong>Scope.</strong> This paper treats Blake’s perceptual
philosophy through the lens of a single formal framework. Other
formalisms—enactivism, dynamical systems theory, integrated information
theory—might illuminate different aspects of Blake’s vision. The Active
Inference lens is not exhaustive.</p>
<p><strong>Empirical standing.</strong> The predictions generated in
§5.2 remain untested. While the ALBUS framework (extending the earlier
REBUS model) provides some indirect support for the psychedelic
prediction, and expertise studies align with the hierarchical depth
prediction, no experiment has been designed to test the Blake–Active
Inference correspondence directly. Future work should operationalize
specific predictions—for example, measuring hierarchical model depth in
experienced contemplatives versus novices using computational
phenotyping.</p>
<p><strong>Translation fidelity.</strong> The Erdman edition provides
our textual authority, but Blake’s composite art—where image, text, and
color form a unified expression—resists reduction to quotation. Our
analysis necessarily privileges the verbal component of works that Blake
designed as visual-verbal wholes. The illuminated books demand a richer
formalism than equations alone can provide.</p>
<p><strong>Historical context.</strong> Blake’s religious
commitments—his unorthodox Christianity, his engagement with Swedenborg
and Boehme, his prophetic self-understanding—provide the matrix within
which his perceptual philosophy developed. Abstracting his insights into
secular computational language risks stripping away the very context
that gave them meaning. We proceed with awareness that translation
always transforms.</p>
<h2 id="contemporary-applications">Contemporary Applications</h2>
<p>The Blake-Active Inference synthesis is not merely historical—it
illuminates contemporary challenges at the intersection of artificial
intelligence, mental health, and embodied robotics. In each domain,
Blake’s phenomenological vocabulary provides intuitive access to formal
mechanisms that would otherwise remain opaque.</p>
<h3 id="ai-consciousness-and-machine-imagination">AI Consciousness and
Machine Imagination</h3>
<p>Blake’s claim that “Imagination is Human Existence Itself” speaks
directly to contemporary debates about machine consciousness. If the
self <em>is</em> the generative model, what of artificial generative
models? Blake’s framework suggests consciousness requires not merely
prediction but <em>creative</em> model-building—the capacity to “Create
a System” rather than merely optimize within one. Furthermore, his Four
Zoas (Equation <span
class="math inline">\(\ref{eq:factorized_model}\)</span>) suggest
consciousness requires embodiment (Tharmas) and affective grounding
(Luvah)—dimensions absent from current AI systems.</p>
<h3 id="mental-health-interventions">Mental Health Interventions</h3>
<p>The synthesis illuminates mechanisms underlying several therapeutic
modalities:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Psychedelic therapy</strong>: The ALBUS framework formalizes
Blake’s “door cleansing” as precision modulation—encompassing both the
relaxation of rigid beliefs and the strengthening of therapeutic
insights—explaining therapeutic effects through prior
restructuring.</li>
<li><strong>Cognitive-behavioral therapy</strong>: CBT operates through
prior revision—identifying and restructuring the “mind-forg’d manacles”
of automatic thoughts.</li>
<li><strong>Contemplative practice</strong>: Meditation traditions
cultivate what Blake called “flexible senses”—the capacity to modulate
precision dynamically rather than remaining locked in prior-dominated
inference.</li>
<li><strong>Narrative therapy</strong>: Blake’s distinction between
“States” and “Identities” anticipates the therapeutic move from fixed
trait identification to fluid state recognition.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="embodied-ai-and-multi-agent-coordination">Embodied AI and
Multi-Agent Coordination</h3>
<p>Active Inference robotics embodies Blake’s perception-action
unity—artificial agents that perceive <em>through</em> acting, not
merely before acting. Blake’s “Energy is Eternal Delight” provides a
phenomenological gloss on the utility-free motivation of free energy
minimization: agents seek not pleasure but self-evidence.</p>
<p>Multi-agent robotic coordination—swarm robotics, collaborative
manipulation—instantiates “Building Jerusalem” at the material level:
shared generative models enabling collective action without centralized
control. Blake’s vision of “Universal Brotherhood” among the Zoas maps
onto the coordination problem in multi-agent systems: how can diverse
inference modes harmonize without homogenization?</p>
<h3 id="emerging-field-convergence">Emerging Field Convergence</h3>
<p>This synthesis sits at the intersection of two rapidly converging
fields: predictive processing approaches to aesthetics <span
class="citation"
data-cites="vandecruys2024order">[@vandecruys2024order]</span> and
cognitive approaches to Romanticism <span class="citation"
data-cites="savarese2020romanticism">[@savarese2020romanticism]</span>.
The convergence is not coincidental—both fields independently arrived at
the same fundamental question: how does the brain’s predictive
architecture shape creative experience? The Phil Trans B 2024 theme
issue demonstrates that the neuroscience community now takes aesthetic
prediction error seriously as a research program. Simultaneously,
literary scholars increasingly recognize that the Romantic poets were
sophisticated theorists of mind, not naïve pre-scientific mystics. Our
contribution bridges these fields by providing what neither has yet
achieved: a formal, equation-level mapping between a specific historical
poet’s cognitive phenomenology and the mathematical apparatus of
contemporary computational neuroscience.</p>
