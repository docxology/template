Three research programs emerge from this synthesis:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  \textbf{Computational modeling of fourfold vision.} Using tools such
  as \texttt{pymdp} (the standard Python implementation of Active
  Inference {[}@heins2022pymdp{]}), one could construct hierarchical
  generative models of varying depth and test whether the
  phenomenological differences Blake describes between single, twofold,
  threefold, and fourfold vision correspond to quantifiable differences
  in model evidence, prediction error profile, and temporal horizon.
\item
  \textbf{Cross-cultural precision modulation.} If Blake's ``cleansing''
  maps to precision rebalancing, then contemplative practices across
  traditions---Zen kōan study, Sufi \emph{dhikr}, Buddhist
  \emph{vipassanā}, psychedelic-assisted therapy---may achieve analogous
  effects through culturally specific means. Comparative studies using
  the Active Inference framework could identify shared computational
  mechanisms beneath surface diversity.
\item
  \textbf{Neuroaesthetic experiments.} Blake's illuminated plates could
  be used as stimuli in fMRI and EEG studies designed to test whether
  viewing visionary art modulates precision weighting in ways consistent
  with the ALBUS framework---specifically, whether exposure to Blake's
  composite imagery alters the balance between high-level priors and
  sensory precision, producing measurable shifts toward ``cleansed
  perception.''
\end{enumerate}
