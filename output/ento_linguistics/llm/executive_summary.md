## Overview

This research investigates the profound influence of language – specifically, Ento-Linguistic domains – on scientific communication and knowledge production within the field of ant biology. The study examines how seemingly neutral terminology, particularly when derived from human social structures, can inadvertently shape research questions, methodologies, and interpretations. Through a mixed-methods approach combining computational text analysis and theoretical discourse examination, the research aims to reveal the often-unacknowledged constitutive role of language in scientific practice, ultimately proposing a framework for more conscious and effective scientific communication.

## Key Contributions

This manuscript’s primary contribution lies in establishing “Ento-Linguistic analysis” as a rigorous methodology for critically examining scientific language. The research systematically maps terminology networks across six key domains – Unit of Individuality, Behavior and Identity, Power & Labor, Sex & Reproduction, Kin, and Economics – revealing significant structural ambiguities and framing assumptions. Specifically, the study identifies a high prevalence of anthropomorphic and hierarchical terminology (73.4% and 89.2% respectively), demonstrating how human social categories are frequently projected onto ant societies. Furthermore, the research highlights the context-dependent nature of many terms, such as “caste” and “queen,” and provides actionable recommendations for clearer scientific communication, including the development of meta-standards for terminological use.  The work extends existing discourse analysis frameworks by explicitly addressing the constitutive role of language in shaping scientific objects and relationships, offering a novel perspective on the social construction of scientific knowledge.

## Methodology Summary

The research employs a mixed-methodology framework combining computational text analysis with theoretical discourse examination. The computational component utilizes a systematic text processing pipeline to analyze a curated corpus of 2,847 entomological publications, extracting terminology across six Ento-Linguistic domains. Network analysis is then performed to map relationships between terms, revealing structural patterns. Simultaneously, theoretical discourse examination employs conceptual mapping to analyze how terminology shapes research questions and interpretive frameworks. The integration of these approaches – as detailed in Section 2.5 – provides both empirical evidence and interpretive depth for understanding the influence of language on scientific understanding.

## Principal Results

The computational analysis revealed a highly interconnected terminology network with significant clustering around the six Ento-Linguistic domains. Notably, 73.4% of analyzed terminology exhibits context-dependent meanings, reflecting the varied ways terms are used across diﬀerent research contexts.  Furthermore, 89.2% of power/labor terms derive from hierarchical human social structures, demonstrating the pervasive influence of human social categories on ant biology research. The network analysis identified key bridging terms that connect diﬀerent domains, while also revealing structural ambiguities, particularly surrounding terms like “caste” and “individuality.”  The research confirms the importance of considering the framing assumptions embedded within scientific language, with anthropomorphic and hierarchical framings dominating the terminology landscape (as detailed in Section 4.3.2).

## Significance and Impact

This research has broad implications for scientific communication generally, highlighting the need for greater awareness of the constitutive role of language in shaping scientific understanding. The findings underscore the ethical imperative for clear communication, particularly in value-aligned scientific communities. By establishing Ento-Linguistic analysis as a critical methodology, the work provides researchers across disciplines with a powerful tool for critically examining their own terminological choices and promoting more inclusive and nuanced scientific discourse. The proposed meta-standards for scientific communication, as outlined in Section 2.7, represent a foundational step towards fostering a more rigorous and transparent scientific enterprise.
