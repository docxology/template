## Overview

This research investigates the critical role of language – specifically, “Ento-Linguistic domains” – in shaping scientific understanding within ant biology. The study examines how terminology networks, often imbued with human-derived assumptions, create ambiguity, influence research questions, and ultimately, impact scientific communication. Through a mixed-methodology approach combining computational text analysis and theoretical discourse examination, the research aims to reveal the constitutive nature of scientific language and provide actionable recommendations for clearer communication practices within entomology and, more broadly, across scientific disciplines.

## Key Contributions

This work makes several significant contributions to the field of scientific discourse analysis. Firstly, it establishes a novel “Ento-Linguistic” framework for systematically analyzing terminology use, identifying six key domains – Unit of Individuality, Behavior and Identity, Power & Labor, Sex & Reproduction, Kin, and Economics – where language significantly shapes conceptual understanding. Secondly, the research demonstrates a high degree of context-dependent meaning in entomological terminology, with 73.4% of analyzed terms exhibiting variability across different contexts. Crucially, the study reveals pervasive anthropomorphic framing (67.3%) and hierarchical influences (45.8%) within ant biology research, highlighting how human social structures are often implicitly projected onto insect societies.  Furthermore, the research provides a robust methodology – combining computational network analysis with theoretical discourse examination – that can be applied to other scientific domains to expose similar constitutive processes. Finally, the study offers practical recommendations for improving scientific communication, advocating for greater terminological awareness and a critical examination of the assumptions embedded within scientific language.

## Methodology Summary

The research employs a mixed-methodology framework combining computational text analysis with theoretical discourse examination.  The computational component utilizes a multi-stage text processing pipeline – tokenization, lemmatization, and term extraction – to analyze a curated corpus of 2,847 entomological publications.  The research then constructs terminology networks based on co-occurrence analysis, identifying relationships between terms across the six Ento-Linguistic domains.  The theoretical component employs conceptual mapping to examine how terminology shapes research questions and methodological choices, focusing on identifying framing assumptions and contextual variations. This integrated approach ensures both empirical evidence and interpretive depth for understanding how scientific language constitutes research objects and relationships (Section 2.5).

## Principal Results

The analysis of the entomological literature revealed significant patterns in terminology use.  The network analysis identified a highly interconnected terminology network with a modular structure, clustering terms around the six Ento-Linguistic domains. Notably, 73.4% of the analyzed terminology exhibits context-dependent meanings, reflecting the diverse ways in which terms are interpreted across diﬀerent research contexts (Section 4.1). Furthermore, 89.2% of terms derived from human hierarchical systems, primarily within the Power & Labor domain, demonstrating the influence of human social structures on ant biology research. The study also identified a substantial degree of ambiguity, with terms like “caste” and “queen” carrying implicit power structures and “individuality” spanning multiple biological scales (Section 4.2).  The research validated these findings through rigorous statistical analysis, confirming the significance of observed patterns (Section 4.6).

## Significance and Impact

This research has broad implications for scientific communication and knowledge production. By demonstrating the constitutive role of language in shaping scientific understanding, the study challenges the assumption that scientific language is a neutral and objective tool. The findings highlight the importance of critical terminological awareness and the need for researchers to actively question the assumptions embedded within scientific language. The established Ento-Linguistic framework can be applied to other scientific disciplines to expose similar constitutive processes, fostering more transparent and collaborative research practices. Ultimately, this work contributes to a deeper understanding of how scientific knowledge is constructed and disseminated, with implications for improving communication across scientific communities and promoting more ethical and responsible scientific inquiry.
